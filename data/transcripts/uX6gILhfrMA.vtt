to hear me
 
00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I'll start off by giving you a little
 
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
bit of a background on this particular
 
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
I represent uh Laconia New Hampshire
 
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
and in Laconia we have a piece of
 
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
property that is known as the state
 
00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 align:start position:0%
school property it's owned by the state
 
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
and it has been there for quite some
 
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
time it uh a bunch of years ago it used
 
00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
to be the state school which housed
 
00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.890 align:start position:0%
to be the state school which housed
um

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
folks who needed uh mental supervision
 
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
and and help
 
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
um it's since been decommissioned and
 
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's just been sitting there so our town
 
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
very diligently
 
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
tried to get some sort of say in what
 
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 align:start position:0%
happens to the disposal of this property
 
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
there was a commission developed called
 
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
the Lakeshore Redevelopment commission I
 
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
do believe and that was uh created in
 
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.370 align:start position:0%
do believe and that was uh created in
2017.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that was to take folks from all
 
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
different sides
 
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
um of of uh government and and private
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
to try and decide what might be a good
 
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
idea and how to work with this uh
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
property as far as what I might need it
 
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
had the ability I believe to make get
 
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
grants there were many studies done to
 
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
see what needed to be done to the
 
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
property to be able to convey it
 
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
um that was all fine and it also gave
 
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
Laconia a voice into what might be done
 
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
with the property
 
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
um they uh had uh one at least one uh
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
person on that commission that was uh
 
00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 align:start position:0%
appointed by uh the the citizens of
 
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
Laconia the city council and I think
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
there was one or two others that were
 
00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
from Belknap County
 
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
what happened was is hb2 came around and
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
as you know how hb2 went
 
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.410 align:start position:0%
as you know how hb2 went
um

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's an ominous Bill and in an Omnibus
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
Bill things get put in and there was a
 
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
piece that was put in and I believe uh
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
you you have this in front of you it has
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's submission house version
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
and final version of of the bill
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
gave the entire authority to dispose of
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
the property to the governor and the
 
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
the reason I wrote the Bill is because
 
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
everybody had been working very
 
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
diligently to try and make an equitable
 
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
decision as to what to do with the
 
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0%
decision as to what to do with the
property

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
um when this occurred that took
 
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
laconia's voice right out of the picture
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
this literally sits within the city it
 
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
always has been it's a fantastic part uh
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
a piece of property
 
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
it is a budding a state park it's a
 
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
budding a sports complex
 
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.270 align:start position:0%
budding a sports complex
um

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of Laconia are
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
concerned as well as even Belknap County
 
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
that something may go there that just
 
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
isn't what they want
 
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
um you know in theory you could put
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
anything there you could put a garbage
 
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
dump you could put a high-tech uh
 
00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 align:start position:0%
Business Park
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
but it should be at least since it's in
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
their backyard they should at least have
 
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
some sort of voice
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
the committee conference came around
 
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.390 align:start position:0%
the committee conference came around
um

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
we tried to to remedy this it got put
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
back to to this language and that was
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the end of it I'm a new legislator I
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it I had one more chance
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
at trying to make this right so I'm here
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
today with this there was no public
 
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
hearing there was no input I would dare
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
don't understand the process of the um
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference or any of that
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
so it just happened and now Laconia is
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
without say
 
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.610 align:start position:0%
without say
um

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
my bill is very crisp it's very clean
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it just uh repeals what was done in
 
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.650 align:start position:0%
um it just uh repeals what was done in
hb2

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out one of the
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
things that is very important is
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
this will revert back to what was
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
already in place and I'd hand handed
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
this out to every I think everybody got
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
a copy and if not I have more this is um
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
title one uh the state and its
 
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
title one uh the state and its
government

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
and it gives the powers and it's uh
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
section 440 acquisition and disposal of
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
real estate section one I just want to
 
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 align:start position:0%
point out it says um
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
Dupont upon determination that the
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
property is no longer needed by the
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
state the governor and Council shall
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
first offer it to the town city or
 
00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 align:start position:0%
county in which the property is located
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
this folks would give Laconia
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
at least a chance in a say in what goes
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
on in their backyard and with that I'll
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions if
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you are there questions from
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
representative Huff um it's my knowledge
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
that they look City of Laconia already
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh had the opportunity to make an offer
 
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
on that property is that correct
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
any further questions I I would want to
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
clarify all you are asking for is that
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
we delete
 
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
what was done in House Bill 2 which did
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
have public hearings in both the house
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
and the Senate
 
00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.270 align:start position:0%
and the Senate
um

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
and revert back to the Redevelopment
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
commission or just the normal process
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
for people to sell the property
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
it does both
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
um on this on the last part the
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment commission never had the
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
authority to do anything with that it
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
was just an uh an information gathering
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was it had the ability
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
to apply for Grants to like find out how
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
groundwater was what the infrastructure
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the buildings were on that that type
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
of thing I believe they did get quite a
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
few uh dollars to have that checked into
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
yes those are open to the public but
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
I've I feel fervently
 
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 align:start position:0%
that that process is not this process
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
this process I think is far more
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
important you have actual committee
 
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.210 align:start position:0%
important you have actual committee
hearings

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
where your elected officials here can
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
make this decision possibly go to the
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
floor go to the whole thing the other
 
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.570 align:start position:0%
floor go to the whole thing the other
one

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
you guys know how that goes I'm not a
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
big fan of it and and I I know that
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
in essence there's public hearings but I
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
would just submit that nobody in the
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
public was probably quite aware of it so
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
I just feel that this would be you know
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
a decent shot at that thank you
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative did
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
you said they they've done some
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
investigations as to the groundwater and
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure contamination in the
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
buildings and that is the city willing
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
to absorb those costs should they be
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
able to buy this property
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
there has been talk about what can be
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
done there what may be done there
 
00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
done there what may be done there
um

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
as far as what the city is willing to do
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
they would have to you know go through
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
their process and decide this is just
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do was just give them
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
so if for example say the powers that be
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
the the the council and whatnot decide
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
that they want to do something and they
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
have a legitimate buyer or somebody
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's interested they can at least make
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
the same offer to the town now the town
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
may decide that they don't want anything
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
to do with it and that that might be the
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
best thing but I just wanted to give
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
them that shot okay
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
if if this legislation prevailed that
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
there would be a time limit for Laconia
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
to to make a
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
a decision on whether to move forward
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
with it with something that they had in
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
mind or not
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that there's a time
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
limit because it's still in the hands of
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh the executive Council and the
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
governor as far as being able to
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
to execute
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
a purchase in sales
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
so it really is just they would have an
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to at least look at it and
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
and if they thought it was good they
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
could maybe match it if they thought it
 
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't you know again it's just it's
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
purely about giving the folks there a
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
real opportunity to have a say in this
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
um the only other pink card that I have
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
better

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
we are being live streamed and so you
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the red light is
 
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:27.829 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the red light is
showing

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mr chairman
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
giving the opportunity to speak I'll be
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
brief there are a couple of bills in
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
front of you to talk a little bit
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
to the sale of that property where most
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
of you know if you don't our 911 psap is
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
located on that property currently we
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we have eyes on
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the legislative
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
level I do have some comments but I
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
think in as I'm seeing the next bill
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
coming up we're probably more in tune to
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
having those comments heard then with
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
our partners at Lakes Region Mutual fire
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
rate as well so if it pleases the
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
chairman and the members of the
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee I can withhold those comments
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
until then
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be fine because I know
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
what you're going to be what to talk
 
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.230 align:start position:0%
what you're going to be what to talk
about

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
and with uh
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
consent of the committee will hold off
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
the questions for for dos until we hear
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
and I would like to call forward the
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
there it is thank you very much Mr
 
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.650 align:start position:0%
there it is thank you very much Mr
chairman

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
um and I hadn't planned on testifying
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I noticed a couple of questions have
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
come up in regards to the intentions of
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
the City of Laconia so for the record my
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
name is Andrew Hosmer I'm the mayor of
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
the City of Laconia and prior to my time
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
being mayor I served in the Senate and
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
worked on this particular piece of
 
00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
property in the City of Laconia because
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's very important to us it's well over
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
200 Acres that the state used as the
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
Laconia characterized it was called the
 
00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:27.139 align:start position:0%
Laconia state school
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
for almost 100 years it was for the
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled it was gifted
 
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:35.420 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
over 100 years ago and meant for this
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
specific purpose as time has gone on and
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
we've changed our approach in the state
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
as to how we
 
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.620 align:start position:0%
care for a treat
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
those in the developmentally disabled
 
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.150 align:start position:0%
those in the developmentally disabled
community

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
that facility was closed after after
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
being closed it was then used as a state
 
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.090 align:start position:0%
being closed it was then used as a state
prison

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.100 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
it was there's an awful lot of barbed
 
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.100 align:start position:0%
wire and high fencing and lights and
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
that is still on the property right now
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
many of the buildings were renovated to
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
accommodate holding of prisoners
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
so what we have on this piece of land is
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
some of the most beautiful land really
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the most beautiful parcel of
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
land in the City of Laconia that is
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
undeveloped at this point but it's also
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
has a a dozen buildings or so that are
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
very old some of them are contaminated
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
many of them are falling down many it
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
was just abandoned by the state and so
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
when you drive by this land you see the
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
blighted and the Beautiful
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
we in the City of Laconia have always
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
looked at this land as something that is
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
part of the fabric of our community
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
though we didn't officially own it we
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
longed for the day that we could have
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
some influence on what was done with the
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
land first and foremost clean it make a
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
determination what level of remediation
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
the land would need because of some
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
toxic substances in the buildings as
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
well as the soil
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
and then second of all what would the
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
residents of the City of Laconia like to
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
see on this beautiful 200 Acres you know
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
the last thing we'd like to see at any
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
point in time is the Prime real estate
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
developed along the thoroughfares Route
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
106 and the buildings that really need
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
attention just left to continue to
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
crumble upon themselves obviously like
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
the rest of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have a housing issue we do not have
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
enough housing for people who live and
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
work want to live there but work in the
 
00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:38.629 align:start position:0%
work want to live there but work in the
area

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:41.420 align:start position:0%
so we have worked closely for many years
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get this property first of all
 
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.210 align:start position:0%
trying to get this property first of all
cleaned

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.220 align:start position:0%
cleaned
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
renovated some of the buildings
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
demolished we made an offer on the
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
property the city did maybe upwards of
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
12 years ago which was
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
rejected for all intents and purposes Mr
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
chair the property was then offered for
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the city offered
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
to the county and the county was in no
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
position to purchase it at that point so
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
this has really gone through a lot of
 
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860 align:start position:0%
twists and turns over the years
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
what we are fully supportive and have
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
had a tremendous working relationship
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
with the Lakeshore Redevelopment
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
commission which has been chaired by
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
George bald former Commissioner of Dread
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
Bob Cheney
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
who is very well experienced in the
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
development of the peas Authority and
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
they work instrumental in taking that
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
land at peace and making it into
 
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220 align:start position:0%
productive economic Redevelopment land
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
so they are very involved in this the
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
city had it so when the commission was
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
created the city had an opportunity to
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
have representation and we had members
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
appointed there are to my recollection
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
four members on this seven-member
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
committee who are from Belknap County
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
over the course of the past four years
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
they've done tremendous work at
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
enhancing the value of the property by
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
delineating Wetlands making further
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
determinations about the level of
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
remediation needed they've also done
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
some great work and been successful in
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
getting grants to say if we were to
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
develop this land what do we need for
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
utilities for water
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure so the value a lot of
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
the variables an investor would look at
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
when considering purchasing the land
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
they've removed those variables which
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
enhances the value of the land
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
so certainly when this came about in hb2
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
last year we were surprised to see that
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the governor was moving in a rather
 
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:35.780 align:start position:0%
rapid fashion to
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
sideline the commission and go to sell
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
the property we worked very hard city
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
council and myself with the commission
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
to say wait a minute we're the
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
commission is doing its job we're right
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
on track here and the city is really
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
involved in in their work
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it didn't work out that
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
way in hb2 passed
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
but since that time what we have been
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
successful in doing is working with the
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
executive Council and getting a
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
resolution passed
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
the there was a contract that went out
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
to market the property we asked that the
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
city be included in any contract with a
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
marketing firm and we were included
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
thankfully thanks to commissioner Kenny
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
and commissioner warmington took the
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
lead on this we really appreciate it
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
which allows the city to have a good
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationship with the
 
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:25.940 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
and with um
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
any action that may take place there I
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
have met regularly with the commissioner
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services Charlie
 
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:37.820 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus just met with him
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
yet two days ago along with Jared nighan
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
who's a taking the lead and marketing
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
the property it's not was not our first
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
choice to proceed this way but in the
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
alternative we're in a position right
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
now where the resolution has been
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
adopted unanimously by the executive
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
Council to make sure the Laconia
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
citizens are included
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
we are in a very good relationship with
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
administrative services and how we're
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
being included in a number of important
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
discussions so I am neutral on this bill
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to give you a little bit of
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
background on representative Thompson I
 
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
water on the land or maybe pollution on
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
the land
 
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
the land
and

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
one thing the city feels very strongly
 
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.210 align:start position:0%
one thing the city feels very strongly
about

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state if there is any groundwater
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
issues or any remediation that needs to
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
be done it's as a result of the actions
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the city is really not in a position
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
to say well we're going to come in and
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
clean the land
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
that we believe that the state Perhaps
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
Perhaps polluted to some extent you know
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
I just don't think we're in a position
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
to shift that all onto the taxpayers and
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
we would rather see this move to private
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
hands put it on the tax rolls give us
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
some housing stock inventory and also
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
preserve some of the beautiful aspects
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
of this property that's longer than I
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
anticipated speaking and I thank you for
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
um it's okay we have lots of time
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
I I fully expected more of the citizens
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
of Laconia to be here to to talk about
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
represent boys
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
thank you mayor Hosmer um as you know I
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
represent Laconia as well and it's my
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
understanding Matt the executive council
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
is working very closely with Laconia on
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
the property now
 
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.610 align:start position:0%
the property now
so

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
are you happy with the way things are
 
00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:40.669 align:start position:0%
are you happy with the way things are
going

00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative borders and thanks for
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
your your leadership and a number of
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
issues in the city and I appreciate our
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
working relationship that we continue to
 
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.450 align:start position:0%
working relationship that we continue to
develop

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I am happy as I said it's not and I
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
know the council is happy with it as
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
well we have six members of the city
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
council it's not the way we anticipated
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
it would go but thankfully commissioner
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus and his team as well as our
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
executive Council has been incredibly
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
receptive to our perspective and our
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
concerns in the city so it's the best of
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
um

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what control you if
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
the property were sold to a private
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
Enterprise what
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
continued role of a city might play
 
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.390 align:start position:0%
continued role of a city might play
through

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
site plan review zoning Etc and uh is
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
that something you feel happy with or
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner uh we do we
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
think that in order for a developer to
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
be successful there they have to have
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
established a good working relationship
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
with the city because you're right we
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
have zoning and we have planning
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
whatever their plans are for any
 
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.470 align:start position:0%
whatever their plans are for any
development

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
we in the city are going to have an
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on that through
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
our zoning board and our planning
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
department and our planning board as
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
well so really um you know it's a
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
expensive it's it's a costly investment
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
for someone to go in there
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I think in order to ensure that they
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
get the most out of their investment if
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to develop the land is to
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
it would be foolish for them to not work
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
very closely with the City of Laconia
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
and maybe giving us some sense of what
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
they want to do and we can at least give
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
it an initial blessing if you will
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
um and saying you know this is the type
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
of development we would like to see
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
happen on this this valuable land so I'm
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
satisfied with our level we have
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
performance zoning in the city as well
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
so we've got some flexibility with our
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances when we look at a
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
project that might be tremendous for our
 
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:48.740 align:start position:0%
economy great for our housing stock
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've got flexibility in zoning to to
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
make that happen and and we're fortunate
 
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.460 align:start position:0%
that we have that
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you mayor
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
I have followed this with you in your
 
00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:11.659 align:start position:0%
town since I first came in 2002.
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
so you have zoning in place you have
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
site plan in place
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if a potential developer were to
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
come along and they were to follow your
 
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:25.340 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations as printed
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
what other what other oversight would
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
your town require
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
is there some special and I'm just
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
asking uh is there some special Playbook
 
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:39.380 align:start position:0%
that they need to go above and beyond
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
what your regulations are
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey I no it's not we
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
performance zoning allowed us to be put
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
a flexible zoning
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
plan in place that allowed us to I
 
00:23:59.890 --> 00:23:59.900 align:start position:0%
believe to look at each individual
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
project and make it take a more holistic
 
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.049 align:start position:0%
project and make it take a more holistic
View

00:24:05.049 --> 00:24:05.059 align:start position:0%
View
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
and and act on it so I don't think
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
there's anything more than that
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
certainly it's been a focus of the city
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
to encourage entrepreneurs and investors
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
to come to our community and make these
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
types of Investments and it's been a
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
mission of mine to make sure that the
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
process is transparent but it's also
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat streamlined so we don't
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
dissuade people from saying geez I don't
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to go to that Community because
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
you'll be caught in red tape for a
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
decade that's one of the worst things
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we can do in a community that's so
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
desperate to have some economic growth
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
and some more housing stocks so really
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's a focus of myself as well as the
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
the whole city council I hope that
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.890 align:start position:0%
answers your question
commitment

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
about the remediation of I'm sure
 
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
there's lead paint and Asbestos and
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatever you've found in the groundwater
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the state taxpayers
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
end up
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.950 align:start position:0%
end up
um

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
with a tremendous Bill and I'm wondering
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
if the commission has any estimates yet
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
from anyone as to what those costs might
 
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.810 align:start position:0%
from anyone as to what those costs might
be

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
I am not familiar with a really
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
Dependable estimate that I could share
 
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:35.419 align:start position:0%
with you what I can share is years ago
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
we were fearful that the contamination
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
level was going to be significant
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
what we have realized through a phase
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
two ground
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
soil study and some building studies is
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that based on the commission's work it's
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
not nearly as extensive as we had feared
 
00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:56.419 align:start position:0%
and is um
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
it probably won't be as costly as we
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
anticipated I know that's still sort of
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and vague but there was a
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
sense of relief about from the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
commission once that phase two study was
 
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:09.860 align:start position:0%
completed that we weren't going to be in
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
you know where there was some concern
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
that we might be completely dependent on
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
Brownfield funding from the federal
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
government in order to remediate the
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
property I think right now that
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
um we feel like we're in a much better
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
position but I can't go too much deeper
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
into that because I don't I haven't read
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
the phase two study and I've only
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
listened to the commission on that I
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
hope that's helpful and answer your
 
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:33.500 align:start position:0%
question it is thank you very much
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions from members of
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh mayor I thank you very much for
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying where the city falls down on
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
the whole process I've been here since
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
2000 and uh
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
I did have heard it all from from that
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
time on and as you know it's been an
 
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
time on and as you know it's been an
ongoing

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
situation but if you think that the
 
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.210 align:start position:0%
situation but if you think that the
um

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
city is in a position to work with Das
 
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
and the executive Council and the
 
00:27:14.649 --> 00:27:14.659 align:start position:0%
governor at this point it is
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
we we feel the same way you know
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
legislation takes twists and turns and
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
you just try to make the best of where
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're at and you know thankfully we
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
live in a state where we still have good
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationships with uh in
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
so many departments so I appreciate that
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
I also appreciate the work and the
 
00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:35.870 align:start position:0%
I also appreciate the work and the
thoughtful

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%

who is not testified in favor or against
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh how it's Bill 1032 wish to speak at

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
1032.
 
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:07.460 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%

email as well a um
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
some research that our committee
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
researcher did on the legislative
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
history of the lucodius uh uh Lakes
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
Region facility it's already back at 99
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
mid 90s up through the current House
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
Bill too I also did up a one-pager that
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
shows what the governor submitted
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill to what the house passed
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and house bill to and what was in the
 
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:46.580 align:start position:0%
final version of House Bill 2 of this of
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
2021. that's just for your edification
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
to know what the bouncing ball did
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and and
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
both of those documents are are
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
important for us to consider when we
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
take up the executive
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1032 which will
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
not be today so I thank you all and as I
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
said to the mayor I thought there'd be a
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
few more people from the city
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
um here to talk about this so I had
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled an hour
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have until 10 30 when we take up a
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
second bill on the Lakes Region facility
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me 10 15.
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
if you are going to be testifying on
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1548 I would appreciate it
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
if you would fill out a pink card and
 
00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to call the public hearing
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1548 an act relating to
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
the sale of the Lakes Region facility to
 
00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:42.740 align:start position:0%
order and I recognize the prime sponsor
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative fellows welcome
 
00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee members
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Sally fellows from
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
holdiness my district also includes
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Hebron
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
the Budget Trailer bill that we passed
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
in June included a new RSA that gave the
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
governor and Council sole authority to
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
sell the Lakes Region facility in
 
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.589 align:start position:0%
sell the Lakes Region facility in
Laconia

00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
Laconia
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
it also amended the definition of Lakes
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
Region facility
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
to specifically exclude Ahern park and
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
if you look on the back side of um
 
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
the written testimony that I gave you
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
the whole section that was included in
 
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.950 align:start position:0%
the whole section that was included in
hb2

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
due to covid
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
this section of hb2 never received a
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing had there been a hearing
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that the lot that includes
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
the state 911 call center and Lakes
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
Region Mutual Aid
 
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.870 align:start position:0%
Region Mutual Aid
um

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
where the lot where those are located
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
would have been excluded also there are
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
people here today who will explain to
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
you why these unique there are unique
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
characteristics of this lot that make it
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
a valuable asset
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
for the two Public Safety operations
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
how relocating them
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
and also how relocating them would be
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
very costly
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
so I will just share with you a few
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
administrative facts the address
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
um 50 through 67 communication Drive can
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
be easily excluded because it's included
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
on the Laconia tax maps it's a 17 acre
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
parcel it includes the building with the
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
call center and the Lakes Region Mutual
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
Aid facility
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a second building that the state
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
used last year for covid quarantine and
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
the parcel also includes part of the
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
access road to Ahern Park
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
I checked the status of the RFP for a
 
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
retail agent to handle the sale of that
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
property governor and Council tabled
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
that item in October
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
since then it has not appeared on the
 
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.650 align:start position:0%
since then it has not appeared on the
calendar

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
I ask that you passed this bill so any
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
sale whether it's a sale this year or 10
 
00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:22.099 align:start position:0%
years from now will not inadvertently
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
exclude these particular properties
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
so people who are going to testify
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
on the specific use of this property can
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
answer detailed questions about that but
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions for me I'm
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.170 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
um

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you excuse me I just want to
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
make sure here I am where is she
 
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
make sure here I am where is she
here

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
did in in the last sentence that you
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
said I thought I heard you say exclude
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
and and this says include I just want to
 
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
you need to have your
 
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.130 align:start position:0%
you need to have your
but

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
so either those property properties
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
should be excluded
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
which is the same as not included so
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would call one of the
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Bob Guida
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
Senate District 2 representing 27 towns
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
in Three Counties Grafton Belknap and
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
Merrimack a good number of my towns use
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
the Dispatch Center up there so I'm
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of this bill for a
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
number of reasons one we've invested a
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding in one
 
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:11.060 align:start position:0%
part of the building
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
and to just
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
throw that away
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make a lot of fiscal sense as
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
well the potential disruption to the
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
safety structure the infrastructure with
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
a potential move I have spoken with both
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
the head of the um
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
The Dispatch Center and with Bob Quinn's
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn about this they are
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
looking at another piece of property
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
and and the caveat of this is that the
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
concerns I've heard from virtually every
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
single one of the towns representing uh
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
that are served by this Dispatch Center
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
is that many of these towns are on a
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
shoestring budget they cannot abide an
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
increase in the fees and costs whether
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time assessment for building
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
a new facility or moving the existing
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
equipment or whether it's an increase
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
long-term in the usage fees that these
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
towns pay for using that service
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
and so my my caveat would be I totally
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
support the carve out for this
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
the exception to that would be if any
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
future move or new building
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
produced not a penny of increased costs
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
to the many small towns and communities
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh fire and safety folks that that I
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
represent and I'll take any questions
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator questions from the
 
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.370 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator questions from the
committee

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator
 
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator
um

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
is there a downstream
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
to the to the life of these buildings do
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
we know how long those buildings will
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
I can't speak with a great deal of
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
authority but having spoken with
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn and with the uh with
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
the director of The Dispatch Center
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
um one part of the building that's used
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh one part of the building is like 50
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
or 60 years old
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it needs significant help all right
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
the other part has had upgrades put into
 
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.930 align:start position:0%
the other part has had upgrades put into
it

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
Downstream usage would require uh most
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
likely a significant renovation of the
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
part that's still old
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
um and so that's a possibility I know
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
that department of safety has is looked
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
at a a piece of property not too far
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
away but the costs of moving and then
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
moving the equipment that we've put in
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
for the Dispatch Center in the last few
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
years and that transition would be quite
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
costly as well so Downstream usage I
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
have heard from the director of The
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
Dispatch Center that
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
they would be willing to take the whole
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
building but it would require a revamp
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
and potential lease out of the other
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
part that that is currently going to
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
need renovation supposedly now again
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's in my conversations I'm presuming
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
that he's here and will probably be much
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
more capable of testifying to those
 
00:51:55.859 --> 00:51:56.930 align:start position:0%
more capable of testifying to those
issues

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
issues
follow-up

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
I understand that there's a third
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
building there that was used for covid
 
00:52:07.859 --> 00:52:09.829 align:start position:0%
building there that was used for covid
relief

00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you have any information
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
on that is that still viable for that
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
same purpose yeah I have no information
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
on that okay thank you very much
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
any further questions from Members
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
Senator uh thank thank you for being
 
00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:29.450 align:start position:0%
Senator uh thank thank you for being
here

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
um the first if I remember correctly uh
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative fellows had mentioned
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
that this is part of a 17-acre parcel or
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
shown on an old tax card is 17 acre
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
parcel and I'm not familiar where this
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
is on that property having driven by is
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
there a possibility if we were to keep
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
one building two building or three
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
buildings that those those buildings are
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
up closer to the roadway I'm assuming so
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
that part of we wouldn't have to
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
withhold 17 acres for that purpose
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you're not the right person
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
probably not the right there's a there's
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
a there's a meaning when your mic won't
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members of
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%

00:53:45.549 --> 00:53:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%

visitors in each of the four seasons
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
although top quality emergency

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
knew that was going to happen
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh and standards and best practices are
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
the major part of what lrmfa does
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
we also coordinate all the mutual Aid
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
within the district we offer field
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%

the state and from as far away as Maine
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
and Long Island
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
we're also one of three primary dispatch
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
centers that manage the State Fire
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
Marshals Statewide all Hazard
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
mobilization plan
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
lrmfa was established in the 50s and
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
began dispatching from the Laconia fire
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
station in the 70s in 1980 lmfa moved to
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
its operations to the courthouse in
 
00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.290 align:start position:0%
its operations to the courthouse in
Laconia

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
Laconia
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
and then in 2000 they were offered the
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to occupy half of a building
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
on the state school property since that
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
time we've occupied our half of the
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
building on the campus
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
the other half of the building is
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
occupied by the New Hampshire division
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
of emergency communications and houses
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
the Laconia 911 peace app and other
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
functions of the Department of Safety
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
when lrmfa occupied the building we
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
spent over a million dollars
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
refurbishing the building and making it
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
our half of the building making it what
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
it is today we've maintained our portion
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the building throughout including
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
HVAC maintenance and any other needs all
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
the building Although our side of the
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
building is in reasonable shape there
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
are maintenance issues which are
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
expected from a 60 year old building
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
by being co-located with 9-1-1 both
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
agencies have realized tremendous
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
synergies by being next door to each
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
other for instance the entire building
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
floats on a battery backup system which
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
takes over until the generator comes
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
online in times of power loss
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
desc built and maintains that system
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
on the other hand lrmfa built and
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
maintains a large Communications radio
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
tower which desc is able to occupy space
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
on thus saving both agencies from
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
building redundant systems for the same
 
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.530 align:start position:0%
building redundant systems for the same
building

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
there's so many benefits to both
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
agencies being low co-located that I
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
could go on and on when legislation
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
passed allowing the governor and Council
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
to dispose of the state school property
 
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
and the RFP was published it took us by
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
surprise and we were nervous as we had
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
never thought about or planned for a
 
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
never thought about or planned for a
relocation

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
relocation
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
it was never on our radar that this
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario was a possibility
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
we began to have conversations with
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and our legislators
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the proposed cost to
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
build a state-of-the-art Communication
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
Center from the ground up
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
aside from losing the Synergy and
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
benefits to both agencies that have
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
realized today if lrmfa were to need to
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
relocate and build a new center these
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
significant costs would be pushed
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
directly onto our 35-member communities
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
and their taxpayers and it may very well
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
Mark The End Of The District
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
that would create a vacuum whereas the
 
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
29 000 emergency fire and medical calls
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we currently dispatch each year
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
would need to be pushed on to other
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
dispatch centers senders centers less
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
experienced than the nuances of fire and
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
EMS dispatching and centers not trained
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
nearly to the level of our professional
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
certified fire and EMS dispatchers
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
since the RFP was published we've had
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
many conversations with the New
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety and are
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
exploring opportunities to continue to
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
co-locate with them in a new building
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
since August we've had much discussion
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
with safety solidifying our partnership
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
with them and we look forward to the
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
opportunity to build the state of the
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
art peace up and emergency Communication
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
Center from the ground up
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
this new opportunity for both agencies
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
to build a new building would allow both
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
agencies to continue to be leaders in
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and to
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
provide our residents and visitors with
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
the best 911 call handling and firing
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
EMS dispatching possible while
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
continuing the wonderful relationship
 
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
that both agencies have enjoyed for 20
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
years we look forward to continuing
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
those discussions with desc and the
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
in closing lrmfa has always remained
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
apolitical over the years and although
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
we do not want to take a position on
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill our general position on this
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
matter as a whole hasn't changed since
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
day one that position has always been
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
and continues to be we don't want to
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
move but we recognize we may not have a
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
choice and if we do not have that choice
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
the move cannot cost our communities and
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers a dime we continue to
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
Advocate if we're asked to relocate that
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
the full cost of relocation must not be
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
born Upon Our member communities and we
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
look forward to the opportunity to
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
continue to work with safety and DSC to
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
make that a reality thank you for your
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
time and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you one request that I have I
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
noticed that you are reading your
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
testimony if you could leave that for
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
the clerk for the for the file it makes
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
it much easier on the the minutes
 
00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:36.910 align:start position:0%
it much easier on the the minutes
um

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
it's it still beats his handwriting
 
00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:46.910 align:start position:0%
it's it still beats his handwriting
but

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
um one question that I have before I
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
look around to the to the committee is
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
you talk that you were in discussions
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
with the other agencies about building a
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
new facility
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
during these discussions are you looking
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the same location or different
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
I would probably defer most of that to
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
director Doyle
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
um we we have located a piece of
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
property that I think would be
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh to both agencies uh and
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
and realistically you know as I said
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
it's a 60 year old building although we
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to take a position on the
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
bill six-year-old building is certainly
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
to to your point to the end of you know
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
getting close to the end of its its life
 
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
getting close to the end of its its life
cycle

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from members of
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
um so according to this bill that we
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
have before us they want to take a 17
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
acre parcel of land you guys don't need
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
the entire parcel that we're currently
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
so little history many years ago a few I
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't know 10 years ago or so maybe a
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more the entire parcel was
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
one parcel at some point the state
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
presumably carved off the 17 Acres that
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
we sit on which is our building which
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
911 co-locates in as well as that
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
building that's used for the covid
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
um covet lodging and I think the the
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
intent we believed at the time the
 
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
intent was now that that's carved off
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
it's removed from we don't have anything
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
to worry about so to speak but
 
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.809 align:start position:0%
to worry about so to speak but
um

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
I can't answer whether we would need 17
 
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
Acres follow-up
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up so if we were able to
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
find a designated space that you're
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
actually occupying and when your Tower
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
is located and carve that out
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
individually that would work as well
 
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.049 align:start position:0%
individually that would work as well
correct

01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
I would have to check with my with my
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
executive committee I don't have the
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
ability to speak specifically to that
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
any representative Eaton
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
hi Chief I'm a director of Southwest
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid um
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
you made a statement that if anything
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
occurs not one penny should go on the
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
it the state builds a new facility are
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
you or is the association
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
intending to pay part of the cost of
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
that or are you expecting to get rent
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
free and moving free
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
so we currently pay rent we also pay our
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
prorated portion if you will of the
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
that anybody would be opposed to to uh
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
reevaluating that lease option right and
 
01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:40.940 align:start position:0%
what those ongoing expenses might be
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions with safety and
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
desc at this point
 
01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:46.549 align:start position:0%
desc at this point
um

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
we would like to co-locate with them at
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
their new building if that's the
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
direction that they go and I think
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's the best option for for everybody
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
realistically if there's a new building
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
you start all the way over you know and
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
you build from the ground up state of
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
the art it's really difficult to manage
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
a six-year-old building and continue to
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
maintain it as a state-of-the-art
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
facility which it is today for us
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
I assume you're aware Southwest we
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
purchased the Old Keene fire department
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
which is 150 years old and we have a
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art facility that handles
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
five times the
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
the population or communities that you
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
do and
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
are doing well and we've floated a bond
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
to the communities to do that
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
from an lrmfa perspective we never
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
when once we located in that building we
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily have on our radar
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we were going to move so we weren't
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
we were not and are not prepared for
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
that to float a bond that certainly is
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
an option but the concern for us is it's
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
never been talked about so if we were to
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
just start doing that now one of our
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
concerns is if one of our communities
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
were to to withdraw
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
that pushes their costs onto the other
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
communities and then it continues to
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
Domino from there Southwest has done a
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
fantastic job with that building
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
um that job that they did with that
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
building is basically what we did 20
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
years ago when we when we moved into the
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
building so we would almost have to redo
 
01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members of
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
I like to call forward I'm Miss Mark
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for giving me an
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you this
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
morning regarding HB 1548 we heard a lot
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
from our partners at Lakes Region
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
director Goldman and his team have
 
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with the Department
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
of Safety and my folks to look at what
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
the potential is for potential impacts
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
are going to be and the potential for
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
scalability is when we end up
 
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
giving the notice that we have to move
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
off that property in the event that it
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
sold so a lot of work as you had heard
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
from director Goldman has gone into the
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
planning and potential execution of a
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
move and what that entails so we've done
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of homework to this point a lot
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
still lies ahead we've looked at it from
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
where we are right now you've heard a
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
little bit about it being a 60 year old
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
building and some of the inherent
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
problems that go along with that just to
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
give you a frame of reference and the
 
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.150 align:start position:0%
give you a frame of reference and the
last

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
12 to 18 months we've replaced HVAC
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
systems boiler systems over the last few
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
years we've replaced the roof on that
 
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
years we've replaced the roof on that
building

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that the costs associated
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
with the upkeep and maintenance are
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
going to continue as would any 60 year
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
old building we had not anticipated on
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
moving anytime soon but further notice
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
that this is a potential that that we
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
will put on alert for back in early
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
summer having said that we are taking a
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
look at the opportunities that exist
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that do present themselves in the
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
event that we have to move including a
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art emergency
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
communications center renew 9-1-1 psap
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
and as the Director of New Hampshire
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 it's my responsibility to make
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
sure that only the highest level in
 
01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
quality of service is rendered to the
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
folks who rely on 9-1-1 Services
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and for those folks
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
that visit the state the reason we have
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
the secondary psap and I call it a
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
secondary pcap only because there are
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
two it really isn't secondary it's a
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
primary by virtue of the the design that
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
it's built on
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
is because we have redundancy built into
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
place the redundancy exists with that
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 Center the redundancy that is in
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
that building as well as far as the
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
radio communication system for state
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
police also exists in that Center as
 
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.349 align:start position:0%
police also exists in that Center as
well

01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
so there were a number of other
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
contingencies that play into our
 
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
decision and play into the consideration
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
and planning associated with any move
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
when we talk about a move we've also
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
talked about where is this going to be
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
and as you heard Chief Goldman speak to
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
we've taken a look at some potential
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
properties in and around the area one of
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
which we thought because our goal is to
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
co-locate with our partners at Lake's
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
region is to make sure that that move is
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
in that Lakes Region Mutual fire rate
 
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.970 align:start position:0%
in that Lakes Region Mutual fire rate
District

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the location that
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
we've actually put eyes on and have had
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
to start a discussion with is a
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
state-owned property that's currently
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
leased to the City of Laconia that's
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
about three quarters of a mile away from
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
where we currently sit
 
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
so from a purpose or perspective of
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
making a move and reduction in costs to
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
move equipment that certainly is an
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency that we can realize we also
 
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that our emergency
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
Communication System that's currently up
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
and running right now that supports
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
State Police and other Public Safety
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders around the state goes with
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
us and there's not going to be a huge
 
01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
us and there's not going to be a huge
lift

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
lift
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
cost wise associated with that as well
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
because we're moving just a very short
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
distance away we still have line of
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
sight with our radio communications
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
towers that handle and provide backhaul
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
for that communication system
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with that move that
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
we started to explore right now a very
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
very rudimentary and and we're not
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
holding any Credence in other than to
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
give us a frame of reference again as to
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
what that might
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
might cost as far as building a new
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
emergency Communication Center and a new
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
psap with the space studies that we've
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
done for the 911 side of the house as
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
well as for Lakes Region and it can be
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
anywhere from seven to ten million
 
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:38.780 align:start position:0%
dollars plus or minus
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't include the costs
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
associated with having to build new
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
systems if that's something that has to
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
be done right now it doesn't look like
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
that it has to be done because many of
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
the systems that we have in place right
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
now including the data operations center
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
the 911 called delivery Network and the
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
radio communications system that we have
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
in place for state police that acts as a
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
redundant backup are fairly new they
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
would not have to be actually purchased
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
and rebuilt and bought just moved simply
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
speaking it's not as easy putting all
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
that equipment in the back of a pickup
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
truck and driving it up the street and
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
then unloading it and then plugging it
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
back in I'm not an I.T guy I know a
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
little about the IT world so there's
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of work in the
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
planning and project development as far
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
as not only the construction of the
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
building and whatnot but also the
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
implementation of putting those systems
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
back in place we've worked very closely
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
with our Commissioner's Office we'll
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the folks over at
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
Charlene arleyhaus and his team to talk
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
about what that's going to look good our
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
next steps are to actually get money put
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
aside in the 911 side of the house to
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
start construction design and
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
Architectural scoping of what it looks
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
like to put a new facility on that
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
parcel that we've currently started to
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
look at right now we want to make sure
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
that at the very least from a planning
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
and responsibility perspective that we
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
have this in our back pocket but what I
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure is is that everybody
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
here in the committee is aware of the
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
very close partnership that we form with
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
our friends at Lakes Region that we've
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
had in place before this even started to
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
happen back in the summer and that we've
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
really solidified over the last eight to
 
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
nine months because of what has been
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
coming down the train track since so far
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
as the potential move we have been made
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
to them and it's been made very clear to
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
us at the department of safety and the
 
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
division emergency services that they
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
are our partners now and they will be in
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
any further move to take a look at
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist now moving
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
forward I think is a great opportunity
 
01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:33.620 align:start position:0%
to say that we can actually put in place
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
what would be developed built and
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
designed as emergency communications
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
center and 9-1-1 Public Safety answering
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
point that we currently have over at
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
Smokey Bear Boulevard at the iPod and
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
that pretty much summarizes exactly what
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to say was this morning and
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
to reiterate again friends at Lakes
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
Region stand very closely with us in
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to work work out the
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
minutia and the details associated with
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
any potential move and what that looks
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
like and I'm available to answer any
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions that any of you might have
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from members of the
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Dahl for your testimony so
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
so it appears in the legislation that
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
came through uh through you folks in a
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
bit of a quandary what are we going to
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
do if we have to move
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
and you've started down that road and it
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
sounds extremely expensive for my seat
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
sitting here so let's let's talk about
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
the the building you're in
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
and I share is there is there adequate
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
room for growth in the building you're
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
in I'm not talking about roof and
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
structure is there adequate room to do
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
what it is you need to do there
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
which is where I believe I'm sorry where
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
I believe you thought you were going to
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
be two years ago
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey that's actually
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
a very good question and I I can't
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
recall who the representative was that
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
asked the question of director Goldman
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
before about the building that's
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
situated on the same parcel there it's
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
called The Doobie building it's vacant
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
right now but it was used for
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
covert overflow for folks that needed a
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
place to stay during the covid response
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
that building was looked at several
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
years ago by not only our department of
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
safety and our division as an expansion
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
point to move over because of the lack
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
of growth in the current building we're
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
all sitting on roughly
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
I think about eleven thousand twelve
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
thousand square footage of space which
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
includes our Public Safety answering
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
Point as well as our database mapping
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I T departments that work in that
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
same building
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
Lakes region is a little bit less than
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
that but we had been looking at other
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to expand we can't go up
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
on that building because of the nature
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the design and it is 60 years old so
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
whenever you start to try to build onto
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
or adjacent to you actually try to think
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
about whether this is not going to be a
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
cost-effective move or not one of the
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
things that we did look at was that
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
building across the parking lot which is
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
the Doobie building what doesn't right
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
now present itself as an adequate
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
location because of all the necessary
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
upgrades and improvements that would
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
have to be done which would include
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
improvements to the infrastructure to
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
make building hold compliant for what it
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
is that we wanted to put in there right
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
now right now we haven't looked at any
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
other opportunities to
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
expand but the opportunities to expand
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
inside that physical structure right now
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
are limited in almost a non-existent
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
you'd mentioned making improvements to
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
the HVAC system and so forth are those
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
recent and was was someone able to
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
access our funds for that purpose
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey and the answer
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
to that is they they were recent
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh in so far as being as recent as over
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
the last month our data center air
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
conditioning system failed completely
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
and we actually had to put in fans to
 
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
draw air out of there for the time being
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
until which time we could get a vendor
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
up to work on replacing those systems
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they are fairly expensive as you can
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
imagine the other system that we had to
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
have replaced and is being worked on
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
right now is our boiler system which I
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
believe I don't want to speak other than
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
my belief right now is that it's about a
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
60 year old system that came with the
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
building that's
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
being plugged Along on life support as
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
many of those systems currently are but
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's being worked on as we speak right
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
now there are pumps associated with
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
pushing the diesel fuel through the
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
system to allow for the heating to work
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
and those systems are
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
being replaced
 
01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
being replaced
follow-up

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman one one easy one
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
for you uh the street address of your
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
building so I can see it online here
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
certainly and thank you for that our
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
actual address for the psap is 550
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
Communications Drive
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
I do have one question following on what
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey just
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
alluded to the arpa funds and now the
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
new infrastructure funds that are
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
available has the department
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
held any discussions with uh
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee the governor or
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
anybody about
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
can any of those funds be used for this
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
building move if it's necessary
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question Mr chairman
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer that directly I know
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed at my level with the
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm not aware whether the
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner has had any more into the
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
weeds or detailed discussion about
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
potential Opera funding for any move
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
look into that a little bit more and
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
provide some information to the
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee on the availability of the
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
funds so that when we discuss this and
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not we we go along with it at
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
least we have some background of if it's
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
going to cost you 10 million dollars
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
could the 10 million dollars be out
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
there somewhere
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
understood and I can certainly do that
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.450 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Thompson

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a money guy
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's all about the money it always
 
01:15:26.159 --> 01:15:27.709 align:start position:0%
it's it's all about the money it always
is

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
um what do you anticipate and you must
 
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.770 align:start position:0%
um what do you anticipate and you must
have

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
in your meetings anticipated the costs
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
of building a building and relocating
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
all this what does that boil down to and
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
I don't need it in specific terms but
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
are we talking 10 million 25 million
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
right now thank you for your question
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson but right now
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
some of the initial numbers that we've
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
obtained and again it's
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
40 000 foot level are anywhere between
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
seven and ten million dollars for
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
facility of the size that we've already
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
put some study into as well as for the
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
move of any equipment that we currently
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
have in place not building of new
 
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
have in place not building of new
systems

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%

any other questions from members of the
committee

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
even apply for them
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll make sure I forward
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
there being no further
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
um pink cards up here has anybody who
 
01:16:42.729 --> 01:16:42.739 align:start position:0%
has not testified on the house bill
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%

whole lot of people but it
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath get a cup of coffee I
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
think that there will be quite a few
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
people in here to talk about that bill
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
I would ask that anybody that is here to

against House Bill 1432 I do need a pink
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
get called to the witness stand thank
 
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
the time being 11 A.M I would call the
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1432 and
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
act prohibiting the use of State funds
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
for new passenger rail projects to order
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.470 align:start position:0%

representative

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
ankenberg and I probably messed up that
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
if I did correct me
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
if it's ready to talk there we go good
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and the committee
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'm here to
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
present for the record I'm Aidan
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
Ankerberg I represent Stratford District
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
10. the lovely city of Rochester
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here to present uh House Bill 1432
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill it prevents
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
State funding from being used to
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
subsidize new commuter rail projects
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to protect New
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers from this financial
 
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers from this financial
boondoggle

01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
boondoggle
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically prohibits State
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
funding from being used to plan
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
construct operate or manage a new
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
Commuter Rail Project
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
of course this deals primarily with the
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
capital Corridor Rail Project
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
um in 2014 the Department of
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation presented the last
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
financial plan for this project
 
01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:16.139 align:start position:0%
of course we are approaching a new phase
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
of this where the financial plan for
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
this current iteration of it will be
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
introduced sometime later this year
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
early next year
 
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.070 align:start position:0%
early next year
um

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
so back in 2014 they estimated that New
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers would be on the hook
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
for 10.8 million dollars annually and
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
that was in 2012 dollars
 
01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.530 align:start position:0%
that was in 2012 dollars
with

01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:35.540 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
246 and a half million dollars in
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional Capital costs for the
 
01:32:40.199 --> 01:32:41.770 align:start position:0%
additional Capital costs for the
infrastructure

01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:41.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today the department
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
cannot give concrete figures of the
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
total expenditure costs or annual annual
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
operating expenses
 
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
estimates say that adjusted for
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
inflation alone the current projections
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
leave us at a conservative figure of
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
292.7 million dollars in capital
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures and 12.8 million dollars in
 
01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
annual operating expenses I have a I
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
have a chart
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
I have a pie chart over there that shows
 
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:13.990 align:start position:0%
I have a pie chart over there that shows
in

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
2016 in terms of federal projects that
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
were presented for funding
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that the overwhelming number of those
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
projects were proposed to be funded
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
through sales taxes both local state
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and an additional taxing mechanisms
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so with the the costs Rising on this
 
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.709 align:start position:0%
um so with the the costs Rising on this
project

01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
and inflation at his 40-year historic
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
highs projected ridership also to be
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
lower given the pandemic and other
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
factors there really is in my opinion no
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
need for for this and the capital
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
Corridor project seems to be a solution
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
in desperate need of a problem so that
 
01:33:59.330 --> 01:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
would conclude my testimony
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from members of the
 
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.149 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from members of the
committee

sent in emails uh remote testimony and
 
01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
the rest all of that will be
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the public record I am
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
not going to read all of them there
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
there are multiple but rest assured we
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
have got them and we have been reading
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%

01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
that and with that I will go to one of
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
the other sponsors uh representative
 
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.770 align:start position:0%
the other sponsors uh representative
Leon

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
Leon
 
01:34:59.470 --> 01:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you Mr chair and
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you members for the committee and
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Erica Leon I represent
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
Rockingham six which is dairy uh I am a
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor on this because I have a degree
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
in economics and I used to be a Bart
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
commuter into San Francisco when I
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
worked on the trading floor and then I
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
used to be a bus commuter into Boston I
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
used to take the bus down and I'd only
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
do it when it was the local because they
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
were able to drop me off in my office
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
which saved me a 15-minute walk
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise it made more sense for me to
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
drive in I also got to enjoy the double
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
taxation when I drove in walking past
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
the Tea Party site enjoying paying
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
income tax to Massachusetts and paying
 
01:35:44.649 --> 01:35:44.659 align:start position:0%
my property taxes here in New Hampshire
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
while this may be a benefit for some of
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
our commuters we have an issue of a lot
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
of our businesses moving out of downtown
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
Boston and out of other concentrated
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
areas to build their own campuses
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
throughout Massachusetts so it's a lot
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
more diffuse it's a lot harder to
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
deliver the employees to their
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
workplaces and then if we and end up
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
funding this through increased property
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
taxes sales taxes or another increase we
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
are going to lose the advantage for
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
these people who find their home here in
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yet continue to work in
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if they're taxed on their
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
income in Massachusetts and then they
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
have an additional tax burden here in
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they will be less likely
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
to live here and they'll be more likely
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
to move into Mass back to Massachusetts
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
or down there in order to improve their
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
overall taxation while I appreciate the
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
idea of having a train to deliver you in
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
comfort and peace to work which I
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
actually could do on BART surprisingly
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
enough it's something where as it
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
increases if we have it it might
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
actually end up being a solution that
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
has even fewer Riders when they look at
 
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
their pocketbook and see what happens
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
with the taxes I'd love to have this if
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
the money grew on trees but I I don't
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
think that it is a prudent use of our
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers resources and I don't see a
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
clear path to providing it without
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
creating more economic harm for our
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
citizens are already highly stressed
 
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.370 align:start position:0%
citizens are already highly stressed
financially

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from members of the
 
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.689 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from members of the
committee

committee
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Michael O'Brien in
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh let me
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I'm representative
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
Michael O'Brien I've represent District
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
26 which is the ward 9 the city of
 
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.189 align:start position:0%
26 which is the ward 9 the city of
Nashua

01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
I also am vice president of nashua's
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
board of alderman I give you greetings
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
from the mayor of Nashua and I speak on
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
his behalf of support I mean against
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill and support of
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
commuter rail
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
we often hear in these Hollow Chambers
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
it should not be the objective of one
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
legislative body to handcuff future
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
and if we take that basic premise that
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
is exactly what this bill does
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
it removes from the table
 
01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
any future discussion on commuter rail
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
I recommend on that alone that your itl
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
now if you were an investor
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
and you saw that the state of New
 
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
and you saw that the state of New
Hampshire

01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
didn't like your particular business
 
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
would you invest in New Hampshire
 
01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.610 align:start position:0%
would you invest in New Hampshire
now

01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
one party over the other party some say
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
better for business
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
let's all act together for what is good
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
for business
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
now let's look at the city of Nashua
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
nashua's history is the gate City
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester to Queen City but how did
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
Nashua become to Gate City
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
because we were the Gateway via the
 
01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:16.910 align:start position:0%
because we were the Gateway via the
railroad

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
we are the ones that opened up the door
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire we still do
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
yet Nashua Bears great burdens
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
from the state do you know how much per
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
capita the lottery relies on the city of
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
Nashua and Manchester the largest cities
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
many towns that perhaps where you come
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
from do not have Keno
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
yet Nashua sells Kino and supplies
 
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.490 align:start position:0%
yet Nashua sells Kino and supplies
heavily

01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
to the education within Nashua Nash was
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
ready to develop
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
you better add a couple more seats over
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
across the way there because going by
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
the last census nashua's population has
 
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.250 align:start position:0%
the last census nashua's population has
increased

01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
and the people in Nashua want to commute
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
a rail who are we
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
as a legislative body
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
want to say that somebody cannot earn
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
Boston wages
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
yet live in New Hampshire
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
if we vote for this particular bill in
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
essence that's what we're saying
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
people who take away the opportunity for
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
people to go down within the Boston
 
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.149 align:start position:0%
people to go down within the Boston
Market

01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
and earn the Boston wage and bring the
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
money back into New Hampshire makes good
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
economic sense to me
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm not an economist I'm a
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
firefighter I was a firefighter but it
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
makes good economic sense to me
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
that uh subsidies people you've got to
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
01:40:59.090 --> 01:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
well that's a kind of a weak argument
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
we subsidize every form of
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
transportation in this state except for
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
commuter rail
 
01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:09.860 align:start position:0%
we subsidize the Manchester Airport
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
national airport we subsidize buses I've
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
had a good fortune in the past working
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
with one of the representatives on this
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
board up in his community of uh buses
 
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
for that particular town
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
and it comes with some subsidies from
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
if we in Nashua and I just want to say
 
01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.430 align:start position:0%
if we in Nashua and I just want to say
too

01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
in Nashua this is not a Johnny come
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
lately decision
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
I am on the mayor's task force for
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
commuter rail I've been on it for eight
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
years we've been working hard on this
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
those are the you know me
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
also note I was former acting chair and
 
01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
vice chair for years in the
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
transportation department next door we
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
have worked hard on this particular
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue but if I ever saw anybody coming
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
up with the final nail of the coffin
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that could do it
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
now I heard some numbers those aren't
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
raw card numbers
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm on those committees do you
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
think I would have seen them
 
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
nobody really knows where this is going
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
to really end up but it's a concept that
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
still needs to be vetted and to disgust
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
and to put it to bed now will never
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
allow that's the state and the people of
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
my community
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
to get to see now the commuter Realm
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
is there a need for it
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're in the position of highways
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
as you know in Massachusetts
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
basically in Nashua roof Reese topped
 
01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.470 align:start position:0%
basically in Nashua roof Reese topped
off

01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
if I came out and told you right now
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
let's wider them and put another Lane in
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
imminent domain
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be encroaching on private
 
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.010 align:start position:0%
you'll be encroaching on private
property

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're there
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
now over across the backboard in the
 
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:15.890 align:start position:0%
now over across the backboard in the
past

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
we heard other ideas of flying cars
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
I supported that technology
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
by representative Smith
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
but here's a problem
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
what do you do with a flying car when
 
01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:30.659 align:start position:0%
you get to Boston
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
do you have to stack them
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
and that's what commuter rail will
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
eliminate it's always been the answer
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
mass transportation is the answer
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
it will allow the lake again the people
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
to go down and work within the Boston
 
01:43:46.739 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
to go down and work within the Boston
Market

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.129 align:start position:0%
Market
now

01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the people up in
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
remote New Hampshire who probably won't
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
see that commuter rail
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
it sure does
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
because the state of New Hampshire sets
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
the tax rate for the city of Nashua
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
and if this is a success to which I
 
01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
firmly believe and hope you share my
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm that it is
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
that tax rate will be uncovered will be
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
assessed to the city and come back in
 
01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:22.139 align:start position:0%
tax dollars
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
to this state
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
Nashville just is looking
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
to do its job by a careful form of
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
government of trying to make it grow and
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
be a total supplier
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
or supporter for some of the funding in
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of things in Nashua
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
we have veterans homes for people who
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
cannot have have difficulties
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning a lot of things that have
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
come from other communities end up in
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
the city
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
Nashua has broad shoulders and we can
 
01:45:08.050 --> 01:45:08.060 align:start position:0%
handle it but we need something
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
economically to continue to make us grow
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
not to be depending upon the state but
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
to be a leader
 
01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.010 align:start position:0%
to be a leader
economically

01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
economically
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is a pro business bill
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
and if you look and if people did their
 
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
homework in the town of Hudson
 
01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:29.420 align:start position:0%
they're opening the Amazon
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
distribution center
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
what they'd not like to have Amazon
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
if you have commuter rail you have
 
01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.109 align:start position:0%
if you have commuter rail you have
Freight

01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
Freight
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
would Amazon like to have Freight
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
good question this would kill it
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I therefore I really would re ask
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
nicely to put your thinking caps on
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
forget any partisan politics or anything
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
else but look at the facts that this is
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be further
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussed and vetted
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
to come back and looking at the future
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
for that's what we're supposed to be
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
doing as elective Representatives
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
and look at the future what commuter
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
rail can do and as far again with the
 
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.129 align:start position:0%
rail can do and as far again with the
subsidies

01:46:19.129 --> 01:46:19.139 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
we subsidize the roads we pave them we
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
scrape them the snow salt them
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
this is no different
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
no different at all
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact with covid
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
the MBTA has seen a 54 percent increase
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
back from covet
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
so this is something that's got to go in
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
the future people of the state want a
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
transportation alternative please
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
allowed them to have that moment and I
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative any questions from
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee saying none
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
next day I would call forward
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative foam in support of the
 
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.050 align:start position:0%
representative foam in support of the
bill

01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
and those coming up to testify
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
please try not to repeat what's already
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
been said and keep
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
present us with new facts if at all
 
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman all of members of
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
Public Works I am Ralph Baum
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough District 20 town of
 
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.290 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough District 20 town of
Litchfield

01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s I was on Judd Gregg's
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
Railway commission we studied bringing
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
commuter rail to Nashua we had many
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
meetings and included representatives
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
from the MBTA after a year discussing
 
01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
and looking at the issues it was
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
determined that computer rail was not
 
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.910 align:start position:0%
determined that computer rail was not
feasible

01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
and even more so now
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
it would determine that the tracks from
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
Lowell up would have to be completely
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
replaced and include turn off tracks the
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
existing track is 15 Mile hour Freight
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's track speed not train speed
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
and worse now has there's less train
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
traffic and is not suitable for a fast
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned earlier about
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
Freight Freight is is coming up now it
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:48:27.239 --> 01:48:28.430 align:start position:0%
can be
so

01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
of course the initial cost of the trains
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
we need the upkeep of them or is that
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
coming from my other pocket the one that
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
pays federal taxes the MBP MBTA is paid
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
for by the Massachusetts state sales tax
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
and property tax from most of the towns
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
east of 495. towns are assessed even
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
though no rail may be even go through
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
this is to pay to subsidy as needed as
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
needed as passengers do not of rail do
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
not pay the cost
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and referred that the MBTA is still
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
having financial problems also in the
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
1990s there was a commuter rail for
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
Merrimack to Lowell was tried it only
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
lasted about a year as with very little
 
01:49:10.679 --> 01:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
lasted about a year as with very little
usage

01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
usage
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
the argument that all transportation is
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
subsidized only goes so far yes our
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
property taxes we pay for Road plowing
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
improvements etc
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
etc but that we can control by our vote
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
there will be no way to say no to a
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
state and proposed subsidy tax we all
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
use the roads a very small amount will
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
use the rail and why should I pay to
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
make it cheaper for someone to go to
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and why should we make it
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
easy for New Hampshire residents to work
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and in a pandemic what
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
better way to transmit it than on a
 
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.810 align:start position:0%
better way to transmit it than on a
train

01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
train
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
instead of spending money on trains the
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
money should be spent on New Hampshire
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
making it more cost effective for
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
businesses to move to New Hampshire so
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
their workers don't have to commute
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
30 years ago there was a push for the
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
circumferential Highway which was
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
supposed to alleviate traffic in Nashua
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
Highway was planned to go through Hudson
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then cross back over to Litchfield
 
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hudson line one of the main reasons for
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
the highway was the train traffic and
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
Nashua would stop traffic for long
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
periods of time between Hudson and as
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
went back the train traffic is nil now
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
had very little Freight and most of that
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
was coal trains
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
the circumference no longer needed
 
01:50:28.490 --> 01:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
traffic is low and trains are less
 
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.570 align:start position:0%
traffic is low and trains are less
frequent

01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
frequent
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
some things same thing will happen if
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
Royale has started with a lot of remote
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
work there will be less need for the
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
people working remotely there will be
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
less need for a train and even now road
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
traffic is lower and will continue to
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
decrease and if Nashua and Manchester
 
01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
want it they can do it we don't have to
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
pay for everybody's things they want
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you do I see any questions from
 
01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.179 align:start position:0%

01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to call forward
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the

committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative David love I represent
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
Rockingham six which is Derry and uh I'd
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
ask you to turn around and take a look
 
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
at that map behind you and and draw an
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
inch and a half circle around Manchester
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
and Nashville because those are the
 
01:51:36.250 --> 01:51:36.260 align:start position:0%
people that will be going to be greatly
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
benefited by uh the rail service the
 
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:42.659 align:start position:0%
rest of the state won't uh you know I I
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
drive a limo you know and uh from the
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
Derry area I I make Logan Airport in a
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
45 to 50 minutes
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and if I went from Derry to
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester waited to get on a train uh
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking more time than that plus
 
01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
more money okay
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
um you know it isn't fair to burden the
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
rest of the state with with projects for
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
um for Manchester and Nashua you know
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's very unfair and um you know
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to to vote this OTP
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
um you know just on that basis alone if
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
a business can't stand on its own
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
without subsidies that shouldn't be
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
business you know
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've got to stop
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
doing this uh the the tax rates that
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
people are always complaining about the
 
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
the tax rates and how much they pay in
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh we'll be adding more
 
01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
taxes uh God only knows what they'll tax
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
next and uh we can't afford it you know
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's um you know and then once again it
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
just isn't right to ask the people of
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester or Romney a hand over to be
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
subsidizing this
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's it thanks
 
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony are
 
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
there any questions from members of the
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Greg Moore representing Americans
 
01:52:58.729 --> 01:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
testify here today uh in favor of house
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1432. I actually had a chance to
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
talk to my old boss former speaker
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
O'Brien who is now a Nashua resident who
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
said to me we should have thought about
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
this 10 years ago so first of all I'd
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
like to thank the sponsor for for doing
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
something that we probably should have
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
done 10 years ago
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 1432 is is important in
 
01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
the sense that it says that the state
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
will not subsidize any new commuter rail
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
service it does not say that new
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
commuter Royal Service cannot happen it
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
does not say that that other sources of
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
funding can't be used to fund commuter
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
rail if the city of Nashua thinks it's a
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
great idea the city of Nashua can has is
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
not blocked by this legislation in terms
 
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
of in terms of bringing commuter rail in
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua so I I want to make abundantly
 
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
clear this is this legislation in no way
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
shape or form blocks any new commuter
 
01:53:58.250 --> 01:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
rail Services all it says is that the
 
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
state citizen shouldn't subsidize it and
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's it is a benefit that would that
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
would benefit a very very small number
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents whereas
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
attacks in order to pay for it would
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
impact all New Hampshire residents so we
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
think that this is a the this
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
legislation is a good idea we think that
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh the state state
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are protected from it but I
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
think the important question is is from
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
a net net perspective what this bill
 
01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.750 align:start position:0%
a net net perspective what this bill
does

01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:30.260 align:start position:0%
as an earlier uh an earlier
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
speaker said one legislature cannot buy
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the hands of a future legislature and
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do should it become
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
law this legislation would ensure that
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and other
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
organizations could not go running wild
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
coming up with a plan for for a new
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
commuter rail it means that they would
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
know that any plan for commuter rail
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
that involved any state subsidies would
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
have to come back through this Committee
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
in order to become law so this this
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
means that that any plans any plans for
 
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
future commuter rail Pros project would
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
have to would have to be brought forward
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
to this committee if they're going to
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
use State dollars so this committee
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
would gains more control about any
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
future Commuter Rail Products by passage
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1432. I think that's an
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
important thing to consider going
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
forward as well so with that I'd be
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%

can you hear me now thanks

01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's not often when you find an
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
initiative that has a support of 75
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire residents it's
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
rare when that support comes from
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%

all agree to support a specific project

members and your constituents
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
they support this initiative because of
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming Economic Development
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that it would provide which
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
would supercharge New Hampshire's
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
already booming economy and bring 5600

01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
rail expansion has also received
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging bipartisan support
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
in August 2018 governor sununu and the
 
01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
governor's advisory Commission on
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
Intermodal Transportation included

Federal funding for Intermodal excuse me
 
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
included Federal funding for the project
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
development phase in the state's 10-year
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
Transportation Improvement plan
 
01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
rail expansion was even touted in the

state's response to the Amazon h2q
 
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:49.850 align:start position:0%

proposal
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
currently the project development phase
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
is underway and that is examining
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
multiple aspects of the proposed Capital
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
Corridor expansion Expansion Project
 
01:58:02.810 --> 01:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
this is an in-depth analysis which is
 
01:58:04.689 --> 01:58:04.699 align:start position:0%
providing solid environmental
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
engineering and financial data to give
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
you our trusted Representatives
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
all the information you need to make an
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
informed decision as to whether or not
 
01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
passenger rail should be expanded with
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
two stops in Nashua in a stop in
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester and at the Manchester Boston
 
01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
Regional Airport
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
as written HB 1432 would eliminate all
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
prospects for investing in rail it would
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
thwart the will of the overwhelming
 
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire residents and
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
would squander this potential Economic
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
Development opportunity
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's an unnecessary preemptive bill
 
01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.169 align:start position:0%
it's an unnecessary preemptive bill
simply

01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:42.179 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
the fat you we don't have all the facts
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
right now to make an educated decision
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
and it presumes the state should invest
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
zero dollars in an infrastructure
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
project before the data is in Veil is
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
so I urge you on behalf of 75.5 percent
 
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents
 
01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
and 110 plus bipartisan Statewide
 
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
businesses that I represent to reject HB
 
01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:09.649 align:start position:0%

committee

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:21.780 align:start position:0%

I don't know okay everybody hear me now
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
all right a question Mr Powers you
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
talked about the business committee's
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
support uh support for Rail and I was
 
01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if you've talked to your
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
members and speaking to the members of
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
your organization are they willing to to
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
help Pony up to help pay for this
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
especially the capital cost and maybe
 
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
the operating costs maybe voluntarily on
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
their own uh to help get this started
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
and help reduce the tax burden if
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh there's
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
been strong business support dating back
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
to I think 2006 when the business
 
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
Community actually uh ponied up money to
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
help with some early studies to examine
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of rail one of the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
important things to think about is that
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
this financial plan that the project
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
development phase is undertaking is
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
examining a number of options of funding
 
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
and we recognize we're in the state of
 
02:00:24.290 --> 02:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we recognize there are
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
non-starters when it comes to investment
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
options and public-private Partnerships
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
can play a significant role in this
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
project and there are a number of
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
businesses that stand to benefit and
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just through the you know
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
through the Manchester and Nashua area
 
02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
yes that is sort of the engine for New
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy when it comes to
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
economic development but I would liken
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
the potential Economic Development
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
opportunities for this project to the
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester Boston Regional Airport you
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
may live in Berlin and never fly out of
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
that airport but you're still reaping
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
the billion plus dollars in economic
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
activity that's derived from that and
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
this project offers those same
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities however if we refuse to
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
fund it without having any data before
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
us we do ourselves in future
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
legislatures and citizens of New
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to service
 
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right thank you follow up
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay all right you said pump mentioned
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships so are you
 
02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
sort of saying in favor of a
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership with your
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
maybe the businesses you represent and
 
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
state government or even public private
 
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:37.940 align:start position:0%
Partnerships among all the communities
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh that will be served by the rail line
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
between Manchester and uh Nashua
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
I think all options would be on the
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
table there's a number of businesses and
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that stand to benefit as
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
well as the citizens and
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
um there are no firm plans for uh the
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
financing at this point but there is
 
02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
very strong interest in this from the
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
business Community okay okay thank you

person to testify today
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to emphasize our
 
02:03:02.810 --> 02:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
continued support of rail expansion in
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire collectively our
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
organizations represent more than 1400
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
businesses across Southern New Hampshire
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
that employ tens of thousands of our
 
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
state's residents and generate millions
 
02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
in economic activity
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Manchester Corridor also
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
serves as the economic backbone of our
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
entire State as goes the economic output
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
of our region so goes the rest of New
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire therefore economic growth
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
along the national Manchester Corridor
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
is important to the overall growth of
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
our entire State's economy
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Capital Corridor Rail
 
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
Project has the potential to have a
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
transformative impact on New Hampshire's
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
economy by positively impacting the
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
Nashville Manchester corridor
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's 2015 Capitol quarter
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit story detailed all this
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
EJ just a few minutes ago gave you all
 
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
those figures so they are in my notes I
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
won't repeat them but they are
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
significant and what the economic impact
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
would be of rail
 
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
this same study also revealed a host of
 
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
additional economic and societal
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
benefits stemming from rail expansion
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
including improving access to the entire
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
region playing a major role in retaining
 
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
young people serving as a catalyst for
 
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
smart development in creating a
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
multimodal transportation infrastructure
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today and we are
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
anxiously awaiting the results of a two
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
and a half year study or also known as a
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
project development phase of Railway
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
expansion New Hampshire being conducted
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
by AECOM Technical Services Incorporated
 
02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:30.500 align:start position:0%
of Manchester with a price tag of 5.5
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
5.4 million dollars of taxpayer money
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
the PDP will not be completed until
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
January 23rd one year from now
 
02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
completing this PDP is crucial as it
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
will allow for a complete understanding
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the costs and benefits of rail
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
expansion and allow policy makers and
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
the public to have the facts needed to
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
consider this important Economic
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
Opportunity for New Hampshire when
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
completed the study will lay out the
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
engineering environmental and financial
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
plan of rail expansion
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
it is our position that HP 1432 is
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
clearly premature it seems more
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to wait
 
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
until this PDP this 5.4 million dollar
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
PDP is completed then with all the facts
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
rail expansion could be openly discussed
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
and debated at that appropriate time
 
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
moreover as written HB 1432 will limit
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
the ability of future legislators to
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
provide transportation's options to the
 
02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire on behalf of
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the 1400 businesses and tens of
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
thousands of their employees that we
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
represent we ask this committee to
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
recommend that HB 1432 be found an
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate at this time
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
now I
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
as Chambers of Commerce we seek a
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
pro-business agenda
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
we don't want to waste a taxpayer monies
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
either and I know that this is what a
 
02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
lot of this is about can't we at least
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
get all of the information before we
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
rush to this decision so I ask that you
 
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration that we all
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
want the facts and to do so this early
 
02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:57.659 align:start position:0%
in the game would really shut out the
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
future potential of rail
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Wendy for
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
your testimony so all I keep hearing
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
from everybody who's testified so far is
 
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester National Manchester Nashua I
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
represent Laconia how is the rail going
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
to benefit me and my constituents
 
02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
if you think about the business taxes
 
02:06:25.609 --> 02:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
that our companies pay in our region
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
that's why we are the big economic
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
Powerhouse that spreads throughout the
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
state those economic things I know from
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
a chamber standpoint too because I
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
talked to my my colleagues who read the
 
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
state that every
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
every region the state is having a war
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue having the rail would
 
02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
bring a lot of workers into New
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know one company right now
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
has to go down and bus employees up from
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
Lowell and and
 
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
Lowell and and
um

02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what the other city is
 
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what the other city is
Lawrence

02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
Lawrence
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
we need Workforce we are not going to
 
02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:00.470 align:start position:0%
we need Workforce we are not going to
grow

02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
grow
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
as an economy without more workers and
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
covet has made that even worse the other
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
thing I'm hearing in today's testimony
 
02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
is about commuters going south to Boston
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
Regional Airport and the state also
 
02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
subsidizes the Boston Express as a
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in New Hampshire that bothers
 
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.709 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in New Hampshire that bothers
me

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
we should be promoting our airport the
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester the Boston Manchester
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
Regional and not leaking all of those
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
passengers and Dollars South to Logan in
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
Boston so that Railway runs both ways we
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members of
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%

I think representative Cloutier is
 
02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
probably going to ask for a question of
 
02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:04.189 align:start position:0%
probably going to ask for a question of
Dot

02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.589 --> 02:08:06.599 align:start position:0%

they would be so kind
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
for the record uh William cast assistant
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and with me is Shelly
 
02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
Winters who's the administrator of the
 
02:08:52.010 --> 02:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
Bureau of rail and uh Transit
 
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:55.139 align:start position:0%
the the real question that I have and I
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
think a couple of the other members of
 
02:08:59.209 --> 02:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
the committee have is
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
the specific language in this bill says
 
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
including the projects named Manchester
 
02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%
I mean Nashua Manchester con uh Concord
 
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:11.540 align:start position:0%
project number
 
02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:13.209 align:start position:0%
project number
40818

02:09:13.209 --> 02:09:13.219 align:start position:0%
40818
 
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
2019-2028 10-year Transportation
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan the question that I
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
have is if this was to pass
 
02:09:28.810 --> 02:09:28.820 align:start position:0%
are we using any state funds currently
 
02:09:33.169 --> 02:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
to do that project or the or the uh
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
study the the study that has been
 
02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.709 align:start position:0%
study the the study that has been
referenced

02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
no uh the project development phase
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's being worked on now that was
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
referenced is uh funded with a 100
 
02:09:50.930 --> 02:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
federal funds so no no State funds are
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
being currently used
 
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
follow up there
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to clarify uh whether
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill passes or not the project
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
development phase contract that's
 
02:10:07.609 --> 02:10:07.619 align:start position:0%
already been awarded and is in progress
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so not by strict
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
interpretation of of the of the of the
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
wording um certainly it would be our
 
02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
intent and I believe hopefully the
 
02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:25.619 align:start position:0%
legislators intent that we finish the uh
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
project development phase and the
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
financial plan so that we have all of
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%

not that are charging time to the
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
project are they uh
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
is that not accounted for separately
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
is not currently charging any time to
 
02:10:52.729 --> 02:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%

know it's it's eligible you know and
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
meet certain criteria would this project
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
the capital cost qualify for any of the
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
money under the bipartisan
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%

study most of the federal funds uh for
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
the capital costs do come with some sort
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
of matching requirement matching okay
 
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:35.460 align:start position:0%

02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:03.780 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman my name is ciao
 
02:13:57.890 --> 02:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
Kelly I'm from Hooksett New Hampshire
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to support this bill my
 
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
reason is
 
02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't pay more taxes for this
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
business of putting this Trail here in
 
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
my main concern is that it's increasing
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
easy traffic for criminals and all other
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
sources like homeless people that dump
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
into the city of Manchester in the state
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that create more
 
02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:27.950 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that create more
problems

02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers in the long run then
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
the business benefit
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
Ed by the people that's that against
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
you know so we need to protect
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
the safety of the Community First
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
and you know that's my main concerns
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
here besides I had to foot that bill too
 
02:14:51.719 --> 02:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
here besides I had to foot that bill too
so

02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
against the Bill thank you for your time
 
02:14:58.250 --> 02:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee seeing
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I used to help with the
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese community in New Hampshire
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts and the thing that I
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
see firsthand in Boston is that this
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
criminals that just get out of Prisons
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
or homeless from different states they
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
just put them all on the train
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and give them a one-way ticket and dump
 
02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
them in this poor town in Boston like
 
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
them in this poor town in Boston like
Dorchester

02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
Dorchester
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
and these poor towns stuck with these
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
criminals walking around their town with
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
needles and the children that's afraid
 
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
to go to school and women like me afraid
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
to walk to the bank and do our
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
businesses is scary they just dump your
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
prop their problems into your town so
 
02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
easily so I'm scared of that for myself
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
and for the children thank you thank you
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony there being no other
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
uh people interested in speaking at this
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
point I am going to close the public
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1432
 
02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:11.219 align:start position:0%

02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
some future date I want the committee to
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
carefully look at what has been
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
presented what we have gotten by via
 
02:16:25.129 --> 02:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
electronic means and or mail and before
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%

02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
next meeting is at 1 15 with the
 
02:16:36.009 --> 02:16:36.019 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to go over
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan process and how the
 
02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
what the availability of funds for that
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
once we uh get everything uh passed out
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
if everybody would take their seats
 
03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:46.670 align:start position:0%
if everybody would take their seats
um

03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
we could go ahead and get started we
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
have is
 
03:47:54.050 --> 03:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
long or as little amount of time as we
 
03:47:55.849 --> 03:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
need today
 
03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
I did ask the commissioner and her staff
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
to come in and talk to us about the the
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process which a lot of the
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
returning members understand how that
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
process works
 
03:48:13.849 --> 03:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
um but also to talk about money The
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
Color of Money which meaning they can
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
only be used for certain things as it
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
comes it becomes available
 
03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:22.250 align:start position:0%
comes it becomes available
and

03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
given the the vast amount of money that
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
was passed in the federal government
 
03:48:29.929 --> 03:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
over the last year and a half or so
 
03:48:33.290 --> 03:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
between American Rescue plan the
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure plan
 
03:48:38.570 --> 03:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
um how that has been incorporated into
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
our transportation planning before we
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
get into the real discussions next week
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
about the 10-year plan I have it
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
scheduled for next week assuming the
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
governor is going to meet his uh
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement to send us the
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan by the 15th but commission
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you coming
 
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
and I know that uh
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
some of it for those of us who enter
 
03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
some of the gas adheries may sound
 
03:49:12.050 --> 03:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
repetitive but it is helpful and it is
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
being recorded live streamed the the
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
other committee members all have been
 
03:49:21.650 --> 03:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
asked to to look at this at some point
 
03:49:24.410 --> 03:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but it's a start and as I told the
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee just a minute ago we have as
 
03:49:30.530 --> 03:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
long or as short as as they want to make
 
03:49:32.929 --> 03:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
it as far as questions go with you I
 
03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
please make sure the mic's on because we
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
you would like to spend with the dot
 
03:49:51.650 --> 03:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
this afternoon we are here to hopefully
 
03:49:53.450 --> 03:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
help you understand all the different
 
03:49:56.090 --> 03:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue that fund the 10-year
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
plan and um
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
as you had requested um chair Graham We
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
have tried to make sure that we walk you
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
through all of the different modes of
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
transportation and as we talk about the
 
03:50:10.729 --> 03:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
available funding we'll also touch on
 
03:50:12.410 --> 03:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
the current condition of the system and
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
the level of service that we're able to
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
provide in the draft 10-year plan
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
you did reference that by Statute the
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
governor does need to deliver the
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
10-year plan to the legislature by

03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
presented at the 22 public meetings that
 
03:51:11.330 --> 03:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
we had across the state um so it's only
 
03:51:13.490 --> 03:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
fitting that Pete will be the one to
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
present today although we wanted to make
 
03:51:16.490 --> 03:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
sure we had all the Commissioners
 
03:51:18.889 --> 03:51:18.899 align:start position:0%
available for questions and then lastly
 
03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
representing the department we have
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
Glenn Davison who is the project manager
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the 10-year plan he's the one that
 
03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually works with the team to create
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
all the presentation materials and
 
03:51:29.809 --> 03:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
everything that we passed out to you
 
03:51:29.819 --> 03:51:31.130 align:start position:0%
everything that we passed out to you
today

03:51:31.130 --> 03:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
so before we jump into the plan I do
 
03:51:36.410 --> 03:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
just want to touch on what's happened
 
03:51:37.969 --> 03:51:37.979 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years with
 
03:51:40.190 --> 03:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
respect to Transportation as you can
 
03:51:43.429 --> 03:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
imagine the covid-19 pandemic really
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
impacted every aspect of the work that
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
we do and we were very relieved going
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
through the budget process last year
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
we've received a lot of support from the
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
governor in the legislature and so um
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
we'll touch today on the available
 
03:52:01.849 --> 03:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
funding but really it's thanks to some
 
03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
of the general funds that were added to
 
03:52:05.450 --> 03:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
our budget as well as emergency relief
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
funds that we receive from the federal
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
government that we've been able to
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
continue with our core services
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
um there's several relief bills that
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
were passed providing funding to all of
 
03:52:17.690 --> 03:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
the modes of transportation and so our
 
03:52:19.370 --> 03:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
airports benefited from those relief
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
packages as well as the public transit
 
03:52:27.889 --> 03:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
agencies and then in the later bills we
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
did receive some funding to offset
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
losses in our state highway revenues and
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll touch very briefly on how
 
03:52:37.610 --> 03:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
some of those funds impact the 10-year
 
03:52:39.969 --> 03:52:39.979 align:start position:0%
plan and then of course most recently
 
03:52:43.130 --> 03:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure investment and jobs
 
03:52:46.490 --> 03:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
act the iija which the administration is
 
03:52:48.290 --> 03:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
also calling the bipartisan
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law the bill so we
 
03:52:53.330 --> 03:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
crisscross sometimes we'll call it bills
 
03:52:55.370 --> 03:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll call it iija from habit
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
but um it is the same piece of
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislation the bill that was passed
 
03:53:01.190 --> 03:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
most recently to fund not only
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation infrastructure but other
 
03:53:04.849 --> 03:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
types of infrastructure and we'll run
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
through those numbers this afternoon as
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
well so with that I'm going to turn it
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
over to Pete who's going to take you
 
03:53:12.050 --> 03:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
through the presentation and the
 
03:53:13.610 --> 03:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
materials in front of you are very
 
03:53:15.170 --> 03:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
similar to the materials that we used
 
03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
when we began this process with gasset
 
03:53:19.809 --> 03:53:19.819 align:start position:0%
and we'll walk you through
 
03:53:22.490 --> 03:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
the overview of the process and then
 
03:53:25.130 --> 03:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
jump into all of the details so Pete
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
03:53:26.880 --> 03:53:27.469 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
um

03:53:27.469 --> 03:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
first I want to say that for those of
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%

process this presentation that I'm going
 
03:53:37.849 --> 03:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
to walk through in paper form has been
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
posted to our 10-year plan website and
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
if you Google
 
03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
nhdot 10-year plan the web page will
 
03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
come up and it's located right at the
 
03:53:52.570 --> 03:53:52.580 align:start position:0%
top of the web page under
 
03:53:54.530 --> 03:53:54.540 align:start position:0%

presentations that we've made and
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
that we have provided over the course of
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
the last few months as we've been
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
traveling around the state given this
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
presentation through our hearing process
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
um uh we'll get started in in the
 
03:54:20.450 --> 03:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
outline we've covered this pretty much
 
03:54:22.370 --> 03:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
but I I we're going to spend a little
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
bit of time on the 10-year plan process
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
itself to refresh everyone about what it
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
is and how it proceeds
 
03:54:32.570 --> 03:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
most of the work is going to be on The
 
03:54:34.849 --> 03:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
Color of Money presentation and the
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
program review we'll have a couple
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
slides on on current state of the
 
03:54:39.479 --> 03:54:41.450 align:start position:0%
slides on on current state of the
infrastructure

03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and and then there'll be a wrap-up
 
03:54:46.010 --> 03:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
slide from there hopefully it'll be
 
03:54:49.849 --> 03:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
about 20 minutes 25 minutes and um
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
we'll get started
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
um so on slide slide three uh there's a
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
graphic there 10-year plan process and
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
and the 10-year plan uh this is the
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
current 10-year plan coming the years 20
 
03:55:07.729 --> 03:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
21 through 2030 and this is our work
 
03:55:11.450 --> 03:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
plan it was approved in June of 2020 and
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
this guides our
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
um our all the work that we do at dot if
 
03:55:17.570 --> 03:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
the project isn't listed here
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
individually or associated with a
 
03:55:22.969 --> 03:55:22.979 align:start position:0%
program in this book we don't work on it
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
so it's it's again it's our work plan
 
03:55:28.610 --> 03:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
and uh so it was approved the 21-30 plan
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
was approved last June and soon
 
03:55:32.929 --> 03:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
thereafter we began the process to
 
03:55:36.050 --> 03:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
update the plan uh for the next uh
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
10-year period which is uh 20 23 through
 
03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
10-year period which is uh 20 23 through
32.

03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
32.
 
03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
and uh that began began with the
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission process
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
which is uh circled in red there where
 
03:55:51.650 --> 03:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
um they reach out to their constituent
 
03:55:53.570 --> 03:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
um solicit for projects and there's
 
03:55:58.250 --> 03:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
debate internally they prioritize those
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
projects and make recommendations for
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
adding projects to the 10-year plan to
 
03:56:04.370 --> 03:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
the DOT
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
dot takes those
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
um reviews them make sure that the scope
 
03:56:12.769 --> 03:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
and budget are aligned and we provide
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
feedback to the regional planning
 
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
commissions and from there they've again
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
prioritized their recommendations from a
 
03:56:22.030 --> 03:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
project standpoint and and submit those
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
to us in the spring in this case it was
 
03:56:28.490 --> 03:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
the spring of 21.
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
from there we move into the gasset phase
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
Governor's advisory Commission on
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
Intermodal Transportation
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and that commission is the five
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
executive counselors and and the dot
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner and um through that process
 
03:56:47.090 --> 03:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
we look to develop strategies to develop
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
a draft of the of the next update of the
 
03:56:51.769 --> 03:56:51.779 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
03:56:55.010 --> 03:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and we develop a draft and then we
 
03:56:58.490 --> 03:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
bring it around uh the state and uh take
 
03:57:01.250 --> 03:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh commentary and and and
 
03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:01.790 align:start position:0%
uh commentary and and and
um

03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
testimony at hearings in this case we
 
03:57:07.969 --> 03:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
did we held 21 public hearings across
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
the state and we had one all a virtual
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing to catch those who
 
03:57:14.450 --> 03:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
weren't able to come we had many of the
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
public hearings that were also also had
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
a virtual component it worked fairly
 
03:57:23.570 --> 03:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
well in most cases and we we gathered
 
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
lots of commentary and maybe there'll be
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity at a future presentation
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
to share some of that with you
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
from there uh we finished the hearings
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
we um we discuss uh the commentary that
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
was received overall with gasset we make
 
03:57:41.450 --> 03:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
some additional recommendations and
 
03:57:43.929 --> 03:57:43.939 align:start position:0%
modify the plan that we came up with in
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
initially and then from there it goes uh
 
03:57:49.969 --> 03:57:49.979 align:start position:0%
to the governor and the governor reviews
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
and updates and then they'll turn it
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
over to uh the house and this committee
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
and uh from and that's where we stand
 
03:58:01.130 --> 03:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
right now hope to provide that
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and tomorrow
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and from there it's it you know it's
 
03:58:08.050 --> 03:58:08.060 align:start position:0%
debated and and you make your
 
03:58:10.729 --> 03:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
recommendations and and adjustments to
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
the plan and ultimately it gets assigned
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
into law by the governor uh this summer
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
in in June time frame so it's a two-year
 
03:58:20.929 --> 03:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
process happens every two years a lot of
 
03:58:23.150 --> 03:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
public input and uh overall I think it's
 
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
a really good process and I think every
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
everybody that's involved in it believes
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good process
 
03:58:28.439 --> 03:58:29.809 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good process
um

03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:29.819 --> 03:58:31.189 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
following two slides uh four and five
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
them because those are basically the
 
03:58:40.330 --> 03:58:40.340 align:start position:0%
specific dates and time periods that we
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
utilized or or actually happened from a
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
from a hearing process standpoint and so
 
03:58:47.210 --> 03:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
you can you can that's that's for your
 
03:58:47.220 --> 03:58:49.189 align:start position:0%
you can you can that's that's for your
information

03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of steps left here
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
but those give you the specific dates
 
03:59:00.410 --> 03:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
so moving on to uh
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
slide six in in seven so The Color of
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
Money presentation
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
and slide slide deck
 
03:59:08.699 --> 03:59:09.469 align:start position:0%
and slide slide deck
um

03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:13.010 --> 03:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
slide seven what you see there is a is a
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
table with a multi-colored uh headings
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
along the top this this table
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
is the same uh table that you received a
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
second uh copy of some of you got the
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
larger copies I thought it would be
 
03:59:29.150 --> 03:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a separate piece because
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
we may want to refer back to this as we
 
03:59:33.170 --> 03:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
go through the slide deck so that was
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
really the main purpose for giving you
 
03:59:37.150 --> 03:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
the breakout table
 
03:59:39.290 --> 03:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
this table
 
03:59:39.300 --> 03:59:40.189 align:start position:0%
this table
um

03:59:40.189 --> 03:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:43.729 --> 03:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
identifies the Investments included in
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
this case the draft 23 through 32 plan
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
by funding categories so each one of the
 
03:59:52.010 --> 03:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
colors across the top is a different
 
03:59:52.020 --> 03:59:53.229 align:start position:0%
colors across the top is a different
category

03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
category
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
and each one of these categories has
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
specific rules uh that go along with
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
them and how you can use the money and
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
where you can use the money and so
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
um this table if you start at the top
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
you look at the top and the road in
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
bridge mode and other modes
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so the other modes include rail
 
04:00:21.250 --> 04:00:21.260 align:start position:0%
Transit and airport and that's 17
 
04:00:23.809 --> 04:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
of the overall
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
um 4.6 billion dollar uh program the
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
road in bridge mode is 83 percent
 
04:00:35.450 --> 04:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the pro of the program the
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
next the next
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
um uh category down from that in the in
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
the blue and the light purple
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
um is Highway funded and non-highway
 
04:00:47.330 --> 04:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
funded so you'll see that the highway
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
funded portion
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
um overall makes up 69 percent of the
 
04:00:52.439 --> 04:00:53.269 align:start position:0%
um overall makes up 69 percent of the
plan

04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
and the balance is in the non-highway
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
funded portion of the plan
 
04:00:58.319 --> 04:00:59.689 align:start position:0%
funded portion of the plan
again

04:00:59.689 --> 04:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
um each cell in this table identifies
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
the Investments included in the in the
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
draft 10-year plan for a particular
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
funding category and a particular fiscal
 
04:01:11.399 --> 04:01:12.650 align:start position:0%
funding category and a particular fiscal
year

04:01:12.650 --> 04:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
and each one of these is a summation of
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
of uh of the the book itself
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
just one quick clarification for for new
 
04:01:27.889 --> 04:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
members or refresher for the veteran
 
04:01:27.899 --> 04:01:29.210 align:start position:0%
members or refresher for the veteran
members

04:01:29.210 --> 04:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:01:34.490 --> 04:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's the dollars that flow through the
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
state highway fund and so all of our
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we receive do go into
 
04:01:51.650 --> 04:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
the state highway Fund in addition to
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
state revenue so that's why we describe
 
04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
that as Highway funded whereas the
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
turnpike is a separate Enterprise and we
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
keep those funds and their own accounts
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
which is why we distinguish between
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
Highway funded and non-highway funded
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
but the highway funded really is the
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
federal funds as well as the state funds
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
just something for the new members to
 
04:02:10.140 --> 04:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
just something for the new members to
consider

04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
um so the other point that I want to
 
04:02:19.150 --> 04:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
make here is the the federal funding the
 
04:02:23.150 --> 04:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
fhwa funding on the far left side makes
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
up 83 percent
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
of of the uh the highway funded portion
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's a significant portion
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
um of the of the pot and it can't be
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
used for operations
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
or maintenance
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
um this uh plan is uh fiscally
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
constrained 4.6 billion dollars in
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
investment and right around 4.6 uh
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
little over
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
4.66 billion in revenue and that's also
 
04:02:54.910 --> 04:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
captured at the bottom of the table
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
and so as the next series of slides will
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
review from right to left in this chart
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
the various categories so that you can
 
04:03:06.889 --> 04:03:06.899 align:start position:0%
use your your separate sheet here if you
 
04:03:08.570 --> 04:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at those and have that
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
separate as we go through the next
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
series of uh slides from a program
 
04:03:12.239 --> 04:03:14.510 align:start position:0%
series of uh slides from a program
standpoint

04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:03:21.650 --> 04:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.600 --> 04:03:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
how about now
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
I apologize folks
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
again just to
 
04:03:40.610 --> 04:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
refresher I have a different
 
04:03:41.929 --> 04:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
understanding of what a betterment is
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
could you I know there's going to be
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
another slide but can you just provide
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.399 --> 04:04:00.889 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so slide 18
 
04:04:02.580 --> 04:04:03.769 align:start position:0%
um so slide 18
um

04:04:03.769 --> 04:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
the betterment program is funded with
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
three cents of the state gas tax okay so
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 22.5 million per year
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
as a slide articulates
 
04:04:13.500 --> 04:04:15.950 align:start position:0%
as a slide articulates
um with

04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
um with
 
04:04:18.769 --> 04:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
most of our state funds 12 comes off the
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
top that's what we call block ground Aid
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
and it goes back to cities and towns and
 
04:04:25.010 --> 04:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
then the remainder of the funds are
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
available to the department to budget
 
04:04:30.650 --> 04:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
for betterment type work so in this case
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's mostly minor bridge and drainage
 
04:04:33.600 --> 04:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
it's mostly minor bridge and drainage
repairs

04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
um and some emergency repairs and the
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the money goes to what
 
04:04:41.570 --> 04:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
we call the district resurfacing program
 
04:04:44.090 --> 04:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
but we'll explain what we're funding
 
04:04:45.769 --> 04:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
with federal funds will become clearer
 
04:04:47.929 --> 04:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
how we then prioritize the state funds
 
04:04:51.889 --> 04:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
um so back to uh slide eight airport
 
04:04:57.479 --> 04:04:59.269 align:start position:0%
um so back to uh slide eight airport
funding

04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:05:02.330 --> 04:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
um total of 382 million dollars
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
programmed in the draft 10-year plan and
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
again if you if you go to uh the the
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
Standalone chart and you look at the
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
airport category you'll see
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
381.99 million dollars at the bottom and
 
04:05:17.570 --> 04:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's the number that I'm referencing
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
there and this will be consistent for
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
the next number of slides just so you
 
04:05:24.290 --> 04:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
can connect the dots
 
04:05:26.330 --> 04:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
the funding is primarily a Federal
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
Aviation Administration funding that's
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
Grant grants based it also has formula
 
04:05:32.760 --> 04:05:34.070 align:start position:0%
Grant grants based it also has formula
apportionment

04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
and funding is restricted for planning
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
studies preservation modernization or
 
04:05:41.210 --> 04:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
expansion of eligible airport facilities
 
04:05:44.090 --> 04:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be transferred to other
 
04:05:44.100 --> 04:05:45.309 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be transferred to other
uses

04:05:45.309 --> 04:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
uses
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire eligible public UCA
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
reports uh the funding splits typically
 
04:05:52.849 --> 04:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
90 FAA funds five percent State funds
 
04:05:55.010 --> 04:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
and five percent local funds and there
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
are 14 projects in the draft tenure plan
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
listed by town and Airport name
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
the next slide uh just shows you a
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about the uh how the uh
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
airport locations are located around the
 
04:06:07.439 --> 04:06:08.330 align:start position:0%
airport locations are located around the
state

04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:06:08.340 --> 04:06:09.849 align:start position:0%
state
um there's

04:06:09.849 --> 04:06:09.859 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
also additional for your information the
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the bound book that we provided
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
you the supplement that we had we made
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
up later earlier this summer has a lot
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
of this information from a mapping
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint that's a little bit a larger
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
scale so you can see them they're very
 
04:06:29.450 --> 04:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
similar to the the plans uh that you
 
04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
have uh tacked around on the walls
 
04:06:33.290 --> 04:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
around the room
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
so they uh there's broke it up into two
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh two different categories federally
 
04:06:40.490 --> 04:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
eligible airports or three commercial
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
airports located in Portsmouth
 
04:06:45.170 --> 04:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester Lebanon and there were nine
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
publicly owned airports so they're all
 
04:06:49.490 --> 04:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
listed here there's also 12 general
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
aviation airports that are not eligible
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
slide 10.
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
Transit funding it's a total of 378
 
04:07:04.510 --> 04:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars program then the draft
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh funding primarily Federal Transit
 
04:07:09.530 --> 04:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
Administration and the fundings
 
04:07:12.670 --> 04:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
restricted for transit services uh
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
basically capital and operating
 
04:07:17.090 --> 04:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
operating and planning and the funding
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be transferred to other uses
 
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
and this also includes the capital
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
Corridor project development phase uh
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
the map on the right shows you various
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
public transit services and again this
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
this map is in your uh supplement that
 
04:07:36.110 --> 04:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
we passed out uh with the green cover on
 
04:07:36.120 --> 04:07:38.330 align:start position:0%
we passed out uh with the green cover on
it

04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.729 --> 04:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
so there are a
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
for funding categories on the on the
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
transit side uh and they're listed here
 
04:07:50.050 --> 04:07:50.060 align:start position:0%
on Slide 11.
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
5307 5310 5311 and 53 39. so the 5307
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
funds urbanized area formula program for
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh Urban uh zone areas and it's for
 
04:08:07.010 --> 04:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
operating preventive maintenance ADA
 
04:08:09.170 --> 04:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
Paratransit Administration capital and
 
04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
planning and the bullet below uh
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
identifies some of the entities that are
 
04:08:19.570 --> 04:08:19.580 align:start position:0%
recipients of those funds

04:08:22.739 --> 04:08:23.929 align:start position:0%
5310 seniors and individuals with
disabilities

04:08:23.929 --> 04:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh it covers accessible Vehicles
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
Mobility management volunteer
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation purchases uh point of
 
04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
service uh
 
04:08:33.060 --> 04:08:34.429 align:start position:0%
service uh
services

04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:08:37.849 --> 04:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
and eligible uh Regional coordination
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
councils rccs and local government
 
04:08:42.130 --> 04:08:42.140 align:start position:0%

04:08:47.450 --> 04:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
inner city bus
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
and 5339 bus and bus facility program
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
again similar what what's eligible and
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
and who um is a recipient of those funds
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's also an additional 30 million
 
04:09:01.490 --> 04:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
dollars uh three million dollars per
 
04:09:03.769 --> 04:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
year transferred from Federal Highway
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
category to FTA for Transit
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
and just a note that there are four
 
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:11.580 align:start position:0%

04:09:23.689 --> 04:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
talking small money but I noticed in the
 
04:09:28.189 --> 04:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
state auction this year the uh I think
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
Boston Express buses that were auctioned
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
off got outrageous money does that go
 
04:09:36.050 --> 04:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
back into this system or does it go to
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:09:41.809 --> 04:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
do we know I know they got I think 150
 
04:09:43.849 --> 04:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
000 for one bus that had half a million
 
04:09:45.889 --> 04:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
miles on it and it was more money they'd
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
purchase of buses
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
that debt service paid with General
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
funds that when we sell a bus the funds
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
go back to the general fund but we can
 
04:10:03.769 --> 04:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
certainly validate that and check with
 
04:10:14.290 --> 04:10:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
slide 12.
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um just a little more on on the public
 
04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
transit side
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
from a service standpoint there were 11
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
local Transit providers seven inner city
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
bus routes uh passenger rail services
 
04:10:34.849 --> 04:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
are two part we have 25 Park and Ride
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
lots and uh the 197 communities are
 
04:10:40.729 --> 04:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
covered by volunteer driver services
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's a big uh
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
um part of the services here and just
 
04:10:48.889 --> 04:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
from a status standpoint we included
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
this in our overall public hearing slide
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
deck from demand response so those
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
limited services for the of our seniors
 
04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
and and disabled uh generally service
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
frequency we find that the there it's
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
limited in the urban areas where there
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
is service so people are looking for
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
more and Route coverage
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
um where there isn't coverage is not
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
enough you know there's no there's
 
04:11:14.929 --> 04:11:14.939 align:start position:0%
limited coverage in rural areas so those
 
04:11:17.330 --> 04:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that we hear as
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative query
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman um
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
just on while we're on this page about
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
Park and Ride lots and all that kind of
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
stuff does this include uh the funding
 
04:11:35.929 --> 04:11:35.939 align:start position:0%
of Staffing for those lots and the hours
 
04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
that those like uh lot buildings are
 
04:11:38.760 --> 04:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
that those like uh lot buildings are
open

04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:11:42.290 --> 04:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
so I think you're referring to our
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
welcome centers um rather than the park
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
and rides which don't have buildings or
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
facilities so we we classify them in two
 
04:11:49.610 --> 04:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
categories there's the welcome centers
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then there's the park and rides the
 
04:11:53.389 --> 04:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
welcome centers are actually staffed by
 
04:11:53.399 --> 04:11:54.530 align:start position:0%
welcome centers are actually staffed by
the

04:11:54.530 --> 04:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
office of travel and tourism as part of
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs and the
 
04:12:00.110 --> 04:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
funding for that goes through their
 
04:12:00.120 --> 04:12:01.189 align:start position:0%
funding for that goes through their
budget

04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:12:01.199 --> 04:12:02.330 align:start position:0%
budget
follow-up

04:12:02.330 --> 04:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
is does that would that include the the
 
04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
station at the North Londonderry uh
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
parking ride lot
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
um that location so those are actually
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
Transit stations that's a third category
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so any of the locations where we have
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
bus service and a bus terminal we
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
actually enter into contracts with
 
04:12:27.969 --> 04:12:27.979 align:start position:0%
a third party to provide those services
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
and so in the case of the 93 Corridor
 
04:12:34.849 --> 04:12:34.859 align:start position:0%
that is done in partnership with Concord
 
04:12:36.650 --> 04:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
Coach who also operate the Boston
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
express bus service on behalf of the
 
04:12:38.760 --> 04:12:39.710 align:start position:0%
express bus service on behalf of the
state

04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:12:41.809 --> 04:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up thank you
 
04:12:44.090 --> 04:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and I guess when we enter when you
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
enter into those uh service agreements
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
do you have set categories for like what
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
they have to meet my my reason for
 
04:12:53.450 --> 04:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I traveled over over the Thanksgiving
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
break and
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
got to the north Londonderry station at
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
5 pm and there was no one uh no one
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
there and it was during a little bit of
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
a cold snap and many people were waiting
 
04:13:13.729 --> 04:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
outside when there was the comfort of a
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
away from wind room that could have been
 
04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
used had someone been there
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
so during the pandemic with the
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
ridership do
 
04:13:27.889 --> 04:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
the cross the transit system we've had
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
to make some decisions around Staffing
 
04:13:33.290 --> 04:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
to meet the need and so certainly as
 
04:13:35.090 --> 04:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more people using Transit
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
again and using the commuter Services
 
04:13:39.650 --> 04:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
down to Boston we are adjusting the
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
hours that the terminals are open and
 
04:13:44.330 --> 04:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
staffed but we've been constantly
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
evolving as we see the ridership come
 
04:13:46.500 --> 04:13:52.370 align:start position:0%
evolving as we see the ridership come
back

04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.380 --> 04:13:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:58.210 --> 04:13:58.220 align:start position:0%
moving on to rail funding and slide
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
13. again it's uh that's the last of the
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
other modes in the uh call out chart the
 
04:14:07.849 --> 04:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
rainbow chart
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
total to 10.6 million dollar programmed
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
in the draft 10-year plan
 
04:14:16.370 --> 04:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
um there's special railroad funding
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
approximately six hundred thousand
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollars per year primarily comes from
 
04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
lease agreements with private rail
 
04:14:24.110 --> 04:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
operators for use of state-owned rail
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
corridors and those funds are used for
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance and construction on
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
state-owned Rail lines and the funds
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for other needs it's also
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
railroad railroad revolving Loan Fund of
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
1.5 million every three years
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
so he's not a state bonded program for
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%

04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
the uh next slide slide 14
 
04:14:55.729 --> 04:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
really highlights the uh the active
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
railroads in the state
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the state-owned railroad lines or
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
194 miles included in railroad operating
 
04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
agreements there are 339 miles of
 
04:15:12.290 --> 04:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
abandoned or inactive Rail lines and 365
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
miles of manage rail trail properties
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has six railroad operators
 
04:15:19.370 --> 04:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
under the under agreement to operate
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%

slide 15 state-owned rail Trails again a
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
map shows the location of these trails
 
04:15:37.010 --> 04:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
and they uh
 
04:15:40.610 --> 04:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
includes about 365 overall miles of
 
04:15:44.809 --> 04:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
managed trails and 224 miles are are
 
04:15:48.050 --> 04:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
managed by D.O.T and the balance of
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
those are managed by uh natural cultural

04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
we've gone to uh slide 16. Turnpike
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
system the graphic at the right shows
 
04:16:05.710 --> 04:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
identifies the three uh Turnpike
 
04:16:09.170 --> 04:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
segments in in New Hampshire
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
you've got the uh the uh Everett blue
 
04:16:15.969 --> 04:16:15.979 align:start position:0%
star and Spalding
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
overall the three segments include 89
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
miles of of uh of Interstate
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
172 Bridges and uh nine toll facilities
 
04:16:30.370 --> 04:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
and as the commissioner mentioned before
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system it's an Enterprise
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
fund so all revenue collected on the
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike from tolls must be used on the
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
overall Turnpike Revenue uh pays for a
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
number of of things the numbers that are
 
04:16:53.290 --> 04:16:53.300 align:start position:0%
quoted here are from uh fiscal year 2021
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance and

uh of the revenue that's collected is
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
used on Capital Improvements
 
04:17:18.530 --> 04:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
approximately 14 million dollars in 2021
 
04:17:20.150 --> 04:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
there was 103 million dollar
 
04:17:22.729 --> 04:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
transactions with about 113 million
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in toll Revenue collected Are We

04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
um the next slide slide 17 uh again
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
looks at the the the general Turnpike
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
programs uh some of which uh both all
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
both of the listings here on this slide
 
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
are mentioned in the previous slide so
 
04:18:07.809 --> 04:18:07.819 align:start position:0%
the turnpike renewal and replacement
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
program trr
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
um and this draft is around 15 million
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
dollars per year and it's used to
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
preserve maintain and upgrade the
 
04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
existing Turnpike infrastructure
 
04:18:20.100 --> 04:18:20.750 align:start position:0%
existing Turnpike infrastructure
um

04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
the uh r r uh program is is required by
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
a bond resolution and it really covers
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
the work that's necessary to keep the
 
04:18:34.010 --> 04:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
turnpike system in in the high level of
 
04:18:34.020 --> 04:18:35.030 align:start position:0%
turnpike system in in the high level of
service

04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:18:37.250 --> 04:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
annual resurfacing programs about seven
 
04:18:39.650 --> 04:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year and and uh the
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
balance of uh that program goes to
 
04:18:44.450 --> 04:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
fridge painting Bridge Rehabilitation
 
04:18:47.929 --> 04:18:47.939 align:start position:0%

signage and such
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
um the Capital Improvements
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
um again these are funded as at the uh
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
at the end of the revenue Stream So from
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
a waterfall standpoint the last uh piece
 
04:19:11.090 --> 04:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
that gets funded is a is capital
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
projects and uh this piece of the slide
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
really shows you the uh projects that
 
04:19:21.610 --> 04:19:21.620 align:start position:0%
are included currently in in this draft
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
and they're listed there there's a
 
04:19:26.809 --> 04:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
there's uh five separate projects uh
 
04:19:29.689 --> 04:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
provides you uh the the location of the
 
04:19:33.010 --> 04:19:33.020 align:start position:0%
project the overall uh
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
funds included in in the 10-year plan
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
the turnpike funds are included in the
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and the a year that those
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
improvements are funded from a
 
04:19:45.530 --> 04:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
construction standpoint so General
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
Sullivan Bridge Rehabilitation
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the average Turnpike widening from
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh to Bedford Manchester exit six
 
04:19:57.530 --> 04:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
and seven reconstruction
 
04:19:59.929 --> 04:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
um and the beau conquered I-93 widening
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
project the listing here includes uh
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
because it's multi-funded it has some
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds with it so the numbers
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
here really identify the the turnpike
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
funding included in in the project
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh the basically the turnpike
 
04:20:19.490 --> 04:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
portion is south of uh louder south of
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
Exit 14
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
i-89 and north of that point is
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
federally funded uh total overall cost
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the project is 375 million dollars
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
and the completion date is 2033 in this
 
04:20:32.520 --> 04:20:35.030 align:start position:0%
and the completion date is 2033 in this
draft

04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.090 --> 04:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
um also uh all electronic tolling is
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
included uh Dover Rochester which was uh
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
is currently under construction that's
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
the uh conversion of the Dover and
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
Rochester tolls to all electronic
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
tolling that should be completed
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
um in in a couple of years and also
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
included in the in the draft is the
 
04:20:58.130 --> 04:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
conversion of uh potential conversion of
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
Bedford tolls
 
04:21:00.779 --> 04:21:01.370 align:start position:0%
Bedford tolls
um

04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative boys
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman regarding
 
04:21:20.689 --> 04:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
regarding the trr what type of a grading
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
system or what type of uh
 
04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
protocols do you use to prioritize the
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
work as it relates to the program that
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh all of the roads we drive all the
 
04:21:43.389 --> 04:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
roads with a van from a from a uh from a
 
04:21:46.809 --> 04:21:46.819 align:start position:0%
payment condition standpoint we also do
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
inspections on all the the bridges
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
um and and through those uh through
 
04:21:59.150 --> 04:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
those inspections we identify priorities
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
um to to do the improvement work so
 
04:22:04.130 --> 04:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
there there's various levels of of
 
04:22:04.140 --> 04:22:05.689 align:start position:0%
there there's various levels of of
service

04:22:05.689 --> 04:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and condition along the turnpike and
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
and there are some areas that need
 
04:22:11.450 --> 04:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
attention sooner than others and and we
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
try to prioritize that
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
um with the r r program so we don't
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're not long looking uh projects
 
04:22:22.250 --> 04:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
generally it's a it's a program where we
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
identify those um those needs and create
 
04:22:28.969 --> 04:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
projects and address them in that
 
04:22:28.979 --> 04:22:30.050 align:start position:0%
projects and address them in that
fashion

04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
04:22:37.370 --> 04:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.910 --> 04:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
so slide 18 state
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about betterment
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
again it's three cents on the state gas
 
04:22:56.450 --> 04:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
tax uh the 22 state gas tax raises
 
04:22:58.490 --> 04:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
approximately 22.5 million dollars per
 
04:22:58.500 --> 04:23:00.229 align:start position:0%
approximately 22.5 million dollars per
year

04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
um the first 12 percent goes to block
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
grant Aid
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
um there's a district resurfacing uh
 
04:23:10.729 --> 04:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
program and and Bridge and drainage
 
04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
repairs and emergency repairs and
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary Force kind of work is uh
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
covers the balance of the betterment
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
SB 367
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
4.2 cents uh on state gas tax collects
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 32 million dollars per
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
year again the first 12 percent
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
goes to block grant Aid
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
the next and and this uh
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
this chart and the next table this tape
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
this this slide in the next table go
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
along with one another so we'll be we'll
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
you know you'll be able to reference
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
back and forth here so uh from a
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
waterfall standpoint the next uh the
 
04:23:58.010 --> 04:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
next category for use of these funds is
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
I-93 uh Debt Service so
 
04:24:04.030 --> 04:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
um SB 367
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
funded a provided the revenue to fund a
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
200 million dollar uh loan to finish
 
04:24:14.210 --> 04:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
I-93 Salem to Manchester
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and this the the increase uh
 
04:24:19.570 --> 04:24:19.580 align:start position:0%
currently initially was used to
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
pay debt uh interest only on that loan
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
and there'll be more evident in the
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
waterfall chart in the next slide uh
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
currently uh through 2025 we're paying
 
04:24:33.650 --> 04:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
2.2 million dollars in interest
 
04:24:37.849 --> 04:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
um and in in 2026 we will be paying full
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh principal and interest on that on
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
that note through 2034.
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
the next category uh for SB 367 revenue
 
04:24:51.290 --> 04:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
is State Bridge aid program for for
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
municipal Bridges
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
um through 2025 6.8 million dollars of
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
SB 367 Revenue goes to that program
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
and after uh by 2026 through 2032 uh the
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
program is reduced based on the revenue
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh projected Revenue collections from
 
04:25:14.450 --> 04:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
the gas tax
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh 4.9 million to 3.3 million from 20 uh
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
26 to 2032.
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then the uh the last uh category uh
 
04:25:29.210 --> 04:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
for SB 367 in the waterfall chart is the
 
04:25:31.729 --> 04:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
tipia Pledge Paving and redless redless
 
04:25:31.739 --> 04:25:32.929 align:start position:0%
tipia Pledge Paving and redless redless
bridges

04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
so by deferring uh principal payments on
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
the on the uh the Tiffany note and
 
04:25:41.410 --> 04:25:41.420 align:start position:0%
tiffia stands for transportation
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Finance Innovation act so
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's a federal it's a Federal Loan
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
program that we um
 
04:25:52.010 --> 04:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
um we got into for a low interest loan
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
to finish that construction effort and
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
part of the uh part of the uh the
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
structure of that loan was that we were
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
able to use the um the the the principal
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
defer principal payments uh to make
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
investments on Rural roads and bridges
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
um through 2025 there's about 20 million
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
dollars per year uh that's used to pave
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
rural roads and bridges and in 2026 that
 
04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
goes away so there's a you know 20
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we've been
 
04:26:27.170 --> 04:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
investing in those rural roads uh and
 
04:26:29.809 --> 04:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
and bridges that will will no longer be
 
04:26:29.819 --> 04:26:32.750 align:start position:0%
and bridges that will will no longer be
available

04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
moving to um
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
slide 19 and I said this this waterfall
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
is what we call the SB 367 waterfall
 
04:26:43.490 --> 04:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
chart and what you'll see is each row
 
04:26:46.269 --> 04:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
represents a fiscal a fiscal year
 
04:26:51.130 --> 04:26:51.140 align:start position:0%
and moving left to right total revenue
 
04:26:56.090 --> 04:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
from the 4.2 cents uh collected is shown
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
in that in that second column
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
um the 12 off the top for the grant for
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
block grant Aid is shown next
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
um The Debt Service on the tiffia note
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
is shown in the next column and you'll
 
04:27:10.080 --> 04:27:11.090 align:start position:0%
is shown in the next column and you'll
see

04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:27:14.330 --> 04:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I've highlighted in red the area of
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
this current draft 10-year plan so for
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years we're at 2.2
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year in debt service
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
and that's the interest only and then in
 
04:27:27.410 --> 04:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
2026 we start paying uh all uh principal
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
next category that receives funding is a
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
state aid for municipal Bridges
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
and you'll note again it's highlighted
 
04:27:42.410 --> 04:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
for this uh 23 through 32 draft 10-year
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
plan period
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's through 31 in this case but so it
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
begins with a 6.8 million and as the the
 
04:27:53.929 --> 04:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
projected Revenue decreases this is
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
where we're going to see a decrease in
 
04:27:58.969 --> 04:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
the program level for funding for state
 
04:28:02.570 --> 04:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
aid uh bridges on the municipal side so
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
it runs again it begins at 6.8 million
 
04:28:08.570 --> 04:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
generally matched with with a 20 match
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
by the municipality and then it's
 
04:28:14.590 --> 04:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
reduced to 3 3.3 million in
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
2032 again because of the projections
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
that we have received from uh road tow
 
04:28:26.929 --> 04:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.889 --> 04:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
moving on uh I do have one clarifying
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
question on the whole
 
04:28:33.600 --> 04:28:34.189 align:start position:0%
question on the whole
um

04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:34.199 --> 04:28:36.370 align:start position:0%
um
waterfall

04:28:36.370 --> 04:28:36.380 align:start position:0%
waterfall
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that you're using
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
projections that show Revenue coming in
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
over time going down
 
04:28:47.330 --> 04:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're looking at the
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
sunset of 4.2 cents and whatever that
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
all breaks into the system at the end of
 
04:29:01.010 --> 04:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:29:05.090 --> 04:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
for the return
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
we had actually hired a Consulting team
 
04:29:11.570 --> 04:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
who helped us forecast Revenue over a
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
longer Horizon Department of Safety
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
collects the highway fund revenue and
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
they as part of the budget process of
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
course work closely with the legislature
 
04:29:23.450 --> 04:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
and near-term forecasts but we had hired
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
a consulting firm to help us anticipate
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
how revenues will continue to climb with
 
04:29:30.170 --> 04:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency of vehicles increasing
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
as well as more hybrid electrical
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles entering the fleet and
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're showing in that
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
second column is declining Revenue over
 
04:29:41.210 --> 04:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
time from this funding source but then
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
also as you mentioned Representatives
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
later on when we Sunset the tiffia
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
pledged work to start paying the
 
04:29:49.490 --> 04:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
principal on the loan that further
 
04:29:51.649 --> 04:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
reduces our capacity to pave the rural
 
04:29:51.659 --> 04:29:57.290 align:start position:0%
reduces our capacity to pave the rural
roads

04:29:57.290 --> 04:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:01.130 --> 04:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:30:03.120 --> 04:30:04.130 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

04:30:04.130 --> 04:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm perplexed at the deferral of
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
04:30:13.010 --> 04:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
principal payments uh I don't understand
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
why you did that
 
04:30:18.769 --> 04:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
I do understand why you did it I don't
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the logic behind it
 
04:30:29.809 --> 04:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.929 --> 04:30:32.939 align:start position:0%
described so if we had used traditional
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
bonding to finish the work on I-93
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
we estimate we would have spent an
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional 20 million or more in
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
financing this particular Loan program
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
we got the lowest interest rate at that
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
time it was 1.09 percent but the reason
 
04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
we qualified for that low interest rate
 
04:30:51.889 --> 04:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
is because we pledged to do this rural
 
04:30:54.530 --> 04:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
work and stretch the value of this new
 
04:30:57.170 --> 04:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue source to not only finish one
 
04:30:59.210 --> 04:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
large-scale project in the southern part
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the state but also bring benefit to
 
04:31:04.729 --> 04:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
the rural communities as well and so
 
04:31:06.170 --> 04:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
basically we're somewhat hedging against
 
04:31:09.889 --> 04:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
inflation by paying interest only the
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
rewarded us with a very low interest
 
04:31:16.910 --> 04:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
rate as long as we in the near term
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're spending the money on the rural
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges and we ended up
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
actually replacing or rehabilitating 23
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
Red List bridges over this period of
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
time where we've been paying the
 
04:31:31.010 --> 04:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
interest only so overall it was a very
 
04:31:31.020 --> 04:31:32.349 align:start position:0%
interest only so overall it was a very
attractive

04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
loan term and we've certainly seen the
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
benefits across the state and in a few
 
04:31:38.389 --> 04:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
minutes we'll talk about the condition
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure you'll see how
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
dramatically our pavement condition in
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
particular has changed over that period
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
and follow-up Mr chairman
 
04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I understand that
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I what doesn't make a
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to me is you're telling us
 
04:31:56.570 --> 04:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
that we're projecting our revenues to
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
drop dramatically over the next few
 
04:32:01.849 --> 04:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
years and you're tagging that money on
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
to the those years
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
the discount you take up front for
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
paying only the interest it's going to
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
go on the end of the loan where we're
 
04:32:14.810 --> 04:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
going to have significantly less Revenue
 
04:32:14.820 --> 04:32:15.969 align:start position:0%
going to have significantly less Revenue
[Music]

04:32:15.969 --> 04:32:15.979 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.640 --> 04:32:22.429 align:start position:0%
 
reduction

04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
worth the price we're going to pay in
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
the end
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
as I said before in total when you look
 
04:32:30.290 --> 04:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
at the full amount associated with the
 
04:32:32.090 --> 04:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
Tiffy alone we will pay less than we
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
would have with traditional bonding
 
04:32:36.769 --> 04:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
because the interest rate was so much
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
lower we actually saved you know at
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
least 20 million dollars more it would
 
04:32:42.649 --> 04:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
have depended on the exact rates the
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
time that we secured a traditional Bond
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
as to how much exactly we would have
 
04:32:49.130 --> 04:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
saved but we estimate we saved 20
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
million over the life of the loan
 
04:32:52.849 --> 04:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
further we then were able to do this
 
04:32:54.889 --> 04:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
bridge work sooner and hedge against
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
inflation so we were able to do those
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
projects in today's dollars versus
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
having to defer some of that bridge work
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
so there were savings from that respect
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
as well okay thank you very much and and
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
just so everybody remembers that when we
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
did the 4.2 cents there was a sunset in
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
that was not tied to Tiff or anything
 
04:33:19.849 --> 04:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
else it was just going to sunset at a
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
certain year
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
by structuring it this way the
 
04:33:26.689 --> 04:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
department was able to leverage
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding in the early years
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
for Paving and Bridge repair and the
 
04:33:31.980 --> 04:33:32.990 align:start position:0%
for Paving and Bridge repair and the
rest

04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
rest
 
04:33:35.330 --> 04:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
by deferring some of the principle
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're still going to have
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the 4.2 cents coming in even at a
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
reduced rate enough to pay off the bond
 
04:33:44.510 --> 04:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
but it was the only way we were going to
 
04:33:44.520 --> 04:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
but it was the only way we were going to
get

04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:33:45.600 --> 04:33:46.250 align:start position:0%
get
um

04:33:46.250 --> 04:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
the interstate finished the bridge is
 
04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
done and still keep the any kind of
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming in at the time and I was
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors of that bill and it
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the date it aligns
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
well with the completion of The Debt
 
04:34:17.330 --> 04:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
Service on the Garvey bonds for I-93
 
04:34:21.470 --> 04:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
also so it's more it leveled The Debt
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
Service payment over time
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
different color of money but it you know
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
from an overall Debt Service load
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
um it leveled that out also so it was
 
04:34:34.970 --> 04:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
all well coordinated from an overall
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
moving on to uh slide 20.
 
04:34:48.010 --> 04:34:48.020 align:start position:0%
so the State Bridge aid program
 
04:34:51.051 --> 04:34:51.061 align:start position:0%
provides State funds to municipalities
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
for bridges for their own uh their
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
municipally owned Bridges
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
early on it's eight and a half million
 
04:34:59.631 --> 04:34:59.641 align:start position:0%
dollars total per year with a 20 match
 
04:35:02.510 --> 04:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
required by the municipality and that's
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
through 2025 and the projection to
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
decline to uh you know somewhere around
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
the four million dollar range by 2032 so
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's the same fund that we talked
 
04:35:14.590 --> 04:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
about in the previous two slides
 
04:35:18.010 --> 04:35:18.020 align:start position:0%
currently there are 113 Bridges enrolled
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
and initially
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
um they were through 2029 and 65 of
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
those are are red listed or poor
 
04:35:26.570 --> 04:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
conditioned Bridges
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
the average cost across those 113
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
Bridges around 1.4 million dollars per
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
year Just for information purposes
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a pretty popular program we do
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
expect to conduct a new solicitation to
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
add new projects
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
um in in the near future which would be
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
wrapped into the next 10-year Plan
 
04:35:50.400 --> 04:35:51.830 align:start position:0%
wrapped into the next 10-year Plan
update

04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
update
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
and um as part of the draft we have
 
04:35:55.379 --> 04:35:56.750 align:start position:0%
and um as part of the draft we have
included

04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:35:59.090 --> 04:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
um a new program
 
04:36:01.369 --> 04:36:01.379 align:start position:0%
um that's that's been proposed for
 
04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
municipally owned Bridges um it's called
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
mobile and we're using some of the off
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
system Federal Bridge
 
04:36:13.970 --> 04:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
funds to fund that program and so that's
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
included in the draft and we'll talk
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
more about that down the road in maybe a
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
work session or another presentation but
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
that is included in in the draft and it
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
was something that
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
um was recommended through the gossip
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.689 --> 04:36:34.699 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 21
 
04:36:37.369 --> 04:36:37.379 align:start position:0%
funding eligibility this is you know
 
04:36:39.650 --> 04:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
where we can use the money
 
04:36:39.660 --> 04:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
where we can use the money
um

04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:43.551 --> 04:36:43.561 align:start position:0%
so we look at all the the uh the road
 
04:36:47.330 --> 04:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
mileage and we have fed Aid eligible
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
roads around 3 700 miles across the
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
state and there's also 1500 plus miles
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
of non-eligible roadways
 
04:36:57.959 --> 04:36:58.910 align:start position:0%
of non-eligible roadways
um

04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:02.449 --> 04:37:02.459 align:start position:0%
and so this from a from a a funding
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint once The tiffia Pledge on the
 
04:37:06.650 --> 04:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
paving is complete
 
04:37:09.590 --> 04:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
um in 2025 they'll be Paving on Rural
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
world to be significantly reduced most
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
of our again the majority of our funding
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
is uh through Federal
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
um reauthorization and through the
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
federal program and there are many miles
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
of roads in New Hampshire that are not
 
04:37:26.449 --> 04:37:26.459 align:start position:0%
eligible for those federal funds
 
04:37:26.459 --> 04:37:29.631 align:start position:0%
eligible for those federal funds
um

04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.570 --> 04:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
and again the uh this is kind of a
 
04:37:34.490 --> 04:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
repeat but the betterment program and
 
04:37:38.330 --> 04:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
the tifia pledge for the SB 367 exists
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
for state roads not supported with
 
04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
federal aid so that's where those that
 
04:37:44.570 --> 04:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
those dollars are being directed
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
um and and you know that 20 million
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
dollars that we have that ends to go to
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
pay uh the the full Debt Service on that
 
04:37:55.250 --> 04:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
note goes away in 2026 and and those uh
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
rural roads are gonna
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
um beware the the reduction in work
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
moving to uh on with the on the federal
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
uh side slide 22.
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
so what we have in this table is a a
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the iija which is the new
 
04:38:24.289 --> 04:38:24.299 align:start position:0%
reauthorization act on the federal side
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's a lot of talk in
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
in the news about the two additional two
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
billion dollars included for New
 
04:38:31.260 --> 04:38:32.449 align:start position:0%
billion dollars included for New
Hampshire

04:38:32.449 --> 04:38:32.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
um in this in this reauthorization and
 
04:38:37.369 --> 04:38:37.379 align:start position:0%
you'll see that First Column for the
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
years 22 through 26 it's a five-year
 
04:38:40.080 --> 04:38:41.631 align:start position:0%
years 22 through 26 it's a five-year
reauthorization

04:38:41.631 --> 04:38:41.641 align:start position:0%
reauthorization
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
the bottom line total is a little over 2
 
04:38:47.570 --> 04:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
04:38:50.090 --> 04:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
um and in in the upper half of that you
 
04:38:50.100 --> 04:38:50.990 align:start position:0%
um and in in the upper half of that you
look

04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:38:53.449 --> 04:38:53.459 align:start position:0%
um so what's included in in that bill
 
04:38:56.051 --> 04:38:56.061 align:start position:0%
for Highway programs is
 
04:38:59.570 --> 04:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
1.139 billion there's a new bridge
 
04:39:03.051 --> 04:39:03.061 align:start position:0%
program a five-year program for 225
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
million there's also an electric vehicle
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
charging program for 17
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's also funds for public
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
transportation in airports
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
so if you compare that total the 1.6
 
04:39:22.849 --> 04:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
1.558 billion dollar total to what we uh
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
what was in the previous reauthorization
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
Act of 1 billion the balance you
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
subtract those column two from column
 
04:39:34.131 --> 04:39:34.141 align:start position:0%
one you get 545 million dollars in new
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
money so that's the new money that we're
 
04:39:37.850 --> 04:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that's available and included uh for
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
the most part in the draft 10-year plan
 
04:39:46.368 --> 04:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
that we have here today
 
04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
so you'll recall one of the topics
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
during the last 10-year Plan update was
 
04:39:55.250 --> 04:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
around the revenue assumptions so the
 
04:39:57.130 --> 04:39:57.140 align:start position:0%
fast act our prior Federal authorization
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
was scheduled to end
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
and so we had worked with both the
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
gasset committee and then with the
 
04:40:04.080 --> 04:40:05.690 align:start position:0%
gasset committee and then with the
legislature

04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
um to estimate what Revenue would have
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the future so for federal funds we
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
had assumed level funding and so that's
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
why we're
 
04:40:17.330 --> 04:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're not adding 1.6 billion dollars
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
worth of projects to the 10-year plan we
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
already had actually a billion dollars
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
worth of projects programmed because
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
we'd assumed level funding and so as we
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
worked with the executive Council we
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
were really only adding the 545 million
 
04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of new projects or adding
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
funding to projects Etc so we'll get
 
04:40:37.130 --> 04:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
into all the detail when we have future
 
04:40:39.530 --> 04:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
work sessions but we wanted you to have
 
04:40:42.530 --> 04:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
that point of reference
 
04:40:45.770 --> 04:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
and just for clarification commissioner
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
when we get into the plan and the couple
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
work sessions that we have uh scheduled
 
04:40:54.530 --> 04:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
to go over individual projects and the
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
rest things like the money for EV
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
charging will be a separate discussion
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
at that point okay thank you because I'm
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
sure that a lot of us have some
 
04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
so when you see the 10-year plan you'll
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
understand what we did but essentially
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
we've added a program for EV charging
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan booklet we're
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
still waiting for a lot of the federal
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
guidance and so we'll talk about that as
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
well in terms of the rules around
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
spending the new categories of funds but
 
04:41:26.570 --> 04:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
we did establish the programs based on
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
what we know and the amount of money
 
04:41:32.930 --> 04:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman commissioner nice
 
04:41:36.368 --> 04:41:36.378 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
the so as wonderful as that sounds 545
 
04:41:43.730 --> 04:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars if we compare that to
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
our other states in our country where
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's a difficult question to
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
answer oh come on
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the traditional
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
Highway programs unfortunately the
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
Congress did not adjust the formulas so
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the core Highway
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
programs we still receive the least
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
funding of all of the states
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
in some of the new categories we
 
04:42:15.170 --> 04:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
actually get a little bit more because
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
they established a lower limit on how
 
04:42:20.570 --> 04:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
much each state should receive so we
 
04:42:23.330 --> 04:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
received as an example 225 million for
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
the bridge program which was more per
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
capita than some other states because
 
04:42:30.050 --> 04:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
there was a specific threshold set for
 
04:42:33.050 --> 04:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
that but the core programs what this
 
04:42:34.490 --> 04:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
committee is used to discussing with us
 
04:42:37.010 --> 04:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
the highway programs we still receive
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
the least and those are the programs
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
that we would anticipate continuing
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Beyond this five-year Bill and we'll
 
04:42:45.530 --> 04:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
again we'll get into all of the revenue
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions for the 10-year plan but
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
this Federal bill was only through 2026
 
04:42:52.250 --> 04:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
so we worked with the Council on
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
forecasts for the second half of the
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and things like the bridge
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
program we think those are going to be
 
04:42:59.208 --> 04:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
one time for this five-year window so we
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
have not continued them into the future
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you over the over the Long Haul we
 
04:43:04.850 --> 04:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
do receive the lease through the
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.878 --> 04:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
so uh the uh
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
second to last uh column there uh it
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
says in draft 10-year plan so there and
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the last column is not in draft so
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
there are some funds that have not been
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh included in the draft because we
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have uh information on them
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and so as we learn more
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
um those
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um those will be addressed and included
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
in the plan but right now
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
um what's included is the one 1.5
 
04:43:45.890 --> 04:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
04:43:52.490 --> 04:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 23 this gives you a
 
04:43:59.390 --> 04:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of flavor for the uh the uh
 
04:43:59.400 --> 04:44:00.530 align:start position:0%
little bit of flavor for the uh the uh
the different

04:44:00.530 --> 04:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
the different
 
04:44:00.540 --> 04:44:01.490 align:start position:0%
the different
um

04:44:01.490 --> 04:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
funding categories within the federal
 
04:44:07.970 --> 04:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
Realm of the Federal Highway funding so
 
04:44:10.128 --> 04:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
we have primary funding for Highway and
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
bridges and there's also some mandated
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and each one of these is
 
04:44:16.330 --> 04:44:16.340 align:start position:0%
a different
 
04:44:19.690 --> 04:44:19.700 align:start position:0%
program from a funding standpoint
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
and it breaks out the the basic
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment in this case uh for each
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
one of these funds for 2023
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
and gives you a sense for where where
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
those programs are there are two new uh
 
04:44:37.128 --> 04:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
programs that were included in the
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
primary funding side a carbon Reduction
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
Program of 5.2 million dollars per year
 
04:44:47.208 --> 04:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
and uh of the protect uh uh program or
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
which is focused on resiliency on the
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
roadway and Bridge Network about 5.9 a
 
04:44:58.368 --> 04:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
um there there's a mandated Federal
 
04:45:00.420 --> 04:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
um there there's a mandated Federal
funding

04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
um with different programs here and
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard these These are the these
 
04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
are retained those are the CMAC or
 
04:45:09.410 --> 04:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
congestion mitigation and air quality
 
04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
program The Rail Highway Crossings
 
04:45:15.410 --> 04:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
program and also the hsip or highway
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
safety Improvement program and the
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
apportionments for those programs are
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
listed here
 
04:45:21.600 --> 04:45:22.128 align:start position:0%
listed here
um

04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned before each program
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
contains specific requirements on on how
 
04:45:30.830 --> 04:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
and where the money can be used many of
 
04:45:33.890 --> 04:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
them come with a population-based uh um
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
criteria in them
 
04:45:40.208 --> 04:45:40.218 align:start position:0%
um and overall the New Hampshire uh
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
received on average around at least in
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
2023 it's 223 million dollars of
 
04:45:49.090 --> 04:45:49.100 align:start position:0%
apportionment and it's about a 24
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
increase overall we had constrained the
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
current 10-year plan at 183 million
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
dollars per year on the federal side
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
from a from a Federal Highway funding
 
04:46:01.798 --> 04:46:05.990 align:start position:0%
from a from a Federal Highway funding
standpoint

04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay uh slide 24 and slide 25.
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
um we've always included a brief
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
discussion on on Turnpike toll credits
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
in our Color of Money presentation
 
04:46:22.368 --> 04:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
as we get lots of questions about
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
um Turnpike toll credits and and what
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh we've tried to be very specific
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
about how we explain this in in uh in in
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
this slide so I'm just I'm I'm gonna uh
 
04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna read this
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
um so we earn the D.O.T earns toll
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
credits uh when uh State funds basically
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll revenues used uh to uh
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
complete work on facilities that serve
 
04:46:54.530 --> 04:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce so the entire
 
04:46:57.770 --> 04:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system is eligible
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and basically it goes to uh the
 
04:47:03.530 --> 04:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the capital program and
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
the r r program
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so these toll credits are earned
 
04:47:12.050 --> 04:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and they're they can be used as a
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
soft match that will allow us instead of
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
making that 20 cash cash match to the
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds typically it's 80 fed 20
 
04:47:24.770 --> 04:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
State we're able to use these toll
 
04:47:28.368 --> 04:47:28.378 align:start position:0%
credits to effectively leverage 100
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal funds
 
04:47:34.550 --> 04:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
um they we we don't get any additional
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
authority obligational authority uh from
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
a federal standpoint we still use what
 
04:47:41.570 --> 04:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
we have however it allows us to make
 
04:47:43.610 --> 04:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
that soft match because of those
 
04:47:46.250 --> 04:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
investments in areas that aren't
 
04:47:50.330 --> 04:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
um utilizing federal funds otherwise
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
um so and I explained the the uh the
 
04:47:55.550 --> 04:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of of total credits
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
um we can use 100 federal funds um when
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
there is no State funds to make the
 
04:48:00.000 --> 04:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
there is no State funds to make the
match

04:48:00.770 --> 04:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
match
 
04:48:02.208 --> 04:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
um and otherwise if we didn't have that
 
04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
state match or the toll credits we
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to take advantage of
 
04:48:07.730 --> 04:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
the of the federal funds so that that's
 
04:48:09.650 --> 04:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's definitely an advantage
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
all but one of the drawbacks is is it
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
reduces the overall program by 25
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um so if if State funds were used as a
 
04:48:21.050 --> 04:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
match uh the 20
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
um the 223 million dollars that we have
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
um in 2020 uh in 2023 would amount to a
 
04:48:32.690 --> 04:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
278 million dollar program so it's a
 
04:48:36.770 --> 04:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.970 --> 04:48:39.980 align:start position:0%
um I I included the uh uh total credit
 
04:48:43.368 --> 04:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
uh projection uh table in in the next
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
slide um this gets updated on on a
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
fairly regular basis
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
and currently
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
um currently and as of 2021 there's
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
about 195 million uh dollars in uh total
 
04:48:57.650 --> 04:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
credit balance
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
um and the red numbers show the
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
projections uh based on what we are
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
aware of at the at the the time that
 
04:49:08.208 --> 04:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
this was as of October 19th 2021.
 
04:49:11.930 --> 04:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
at a future meeting not right now
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
um a certain state senator keeps
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
bringing up a pilot program about
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
selling toll credits I would like that
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
to be brought up as a point of
 
04:49:25.250 --> 04:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee but we
 
04:49:28.190 --> 04:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't need to do it today and what it
 
04:49:30.410 --> 04:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
means and the rest and I don't know if
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's even too late for us to apply for
 
04:49:34.570 --> 04:49:34.580 align:start position:0%
the pilot program
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
so the language establishing the pilot
 
04:49:40.610 --> 04:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
program was included in the iija that
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
was just passed so there is very little
 
04:49:43.970 --> 04:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
information available on how that
 
04:49:45.730 --> 04:49:45.740 align:start position:0%
program will actually be administered
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire certainly has interest
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
in being part of the program
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
but there are some drawbacks and
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
certainly you know
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's different thoughts around how
 
04:50:00.770 --> 04:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
many total credits we should retain and
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
why we would want to keep those balances
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
at a certain level and the other thing
 
04:50:05.930 --> 04:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
that we'll dig into if we do a
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
presentation on this topic specifically
 
04:50:09.550 --> 04:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
is you'll notice that
 
04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
those criterias to other tool credits
 
04:50:14.570 --> 04:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
are even available in certain years so
 
04:50:24.970 --> 04:50:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.980 --> 04:50:27.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:50:27.250 --> 04:50:27.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:50:29.930 --> 04:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
a couple more uh slides to go through
 
04:50:31.970 --> 04:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
moving into
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
um state of the infrastructure uh slides
 
04:50:38.448 --> 04:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
and just as a as a review
 
04:50:41.448 --> 04:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
um our state roadway Network and this is
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
on on Slide 27.
 
04:50:46.610 --> 04:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
um we have categorized the various
 
04:50:49.730 --> 04:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
levels of a roadway as tiers so tier one
 
04:50:53.208 --> 04:50:53.218 align:start position:0%
through tier four uh tier one and two
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
are Statewide Transportation corridors
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
higher volume higher speeds
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
um you know tier one or interstates and
 
04:51:03.708 --> 04:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
divided highways in tier two a major
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide corridors the mileage for each
 
04:51:08.650 --> 04:51:08.660 align:start position:0%
one of those tiers is identified
 
04:51:11.810 --> 04:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
on the slide and then tier three and
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
four are more Regional corridors and
 
04:51:16.610 --> 04:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
local connectors again moderate speeds
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
moderate traffic moderate to low traffic
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
volumes and the mileage for each one of
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
those tiers
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
um are listed here and many of the I
 
04:51:31.010 --> 04:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
guess all of the uh
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
roadway miles that are not eligible for
 
04:51:37.850 --> 04:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
federal funds can be found on the tier
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
so moving moving to the next slide
 
04:51:54.890 --> 04:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
and what we what we've done here is try
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
to provide some sense for how the the
 
04:52:03.050 --> 04:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
road uh the the road surface conditions
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
are changing over time
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
by each one of the the tiers so again
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
tier one is the higher volume the
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
interstates tier four are the more local
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
connector roads and each one of these
 
04:52:20.090 --> 04:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
tiers has
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
um four sets of of data in them ranging
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
from pavement condition from uh the 17
 
04:52:30.530 --> 04:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
to 26 10-year plan
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
through the one without the gray shading
 
04:52:35.810 --> 04:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
which is the 23 through 32 tenure this
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
draft 10-year plan uh period so again
 
04:52:40.490 --> 04:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:52:43.368 --> 04:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
um every two years every year we we
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
drive every every Road in the state and
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
we measure the condition of those roads
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
and we assign a a roughness index to it
 
04:52:51.660 --> 04:52:53.448 align:start position:0%
and we assign a a roughness index to it
and

04:52:53.448 --> 04:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:56.208 --> 04:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
um there are different grades in that
 
04:53:00.050 --> 04:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so good is a has an iri of of less
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
than 95 and very poor is has an iri of
 
04:53:07.250 --> 04:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
larger than 350 and so you can see as
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
you go from the higher volume roads we
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
those try to keep those in in pretty
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape there's over 90
 
04:53:20.208 --> 04:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
percent good as you go down in tier you
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
see the condition how it's changed and
 
04:53:24.050 --> 04:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
but what also you can see from this
 
04:53:25.970 --> 04:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
chart is the investment that we've been
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
making over time and a lot of it's
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
specifically due to the the state level
 
04:53:35.330 --> 04:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
of investment with SB 367 and that
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
tiffia pledge you'll note that the
 
04:53:40.610 --> 04:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
condition has improved significantly
 
04:53:43.250 --> 04:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
over this time period if you look at
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
tier three and tier four
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
um overall you can see that that
 
04:53:51.708 --> 04:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
improvement over time so currently where
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
we stand uh tier one 96 percent of the
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
roads are in
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
um good condition and our Target that
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
we've set is 95 so we've we've we've
 
04:54:02.510 --> 04:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
we've met our Target
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
on tier two 92 percent are in good or
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
for fair condition and our Target is 90
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
90 percent and that has was increased by
 
04:54:13.730 --> 04:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
five percent so we've we've improved by
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
five percent over the last round of the
 
04:54:19.090 --> 04:54:19.100 align:start position:0%
10-year plan uh the levels that we had
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
tier three
 
04:54:25.128 --> 04:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
we are 80 go to fair and our Target's 80
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
percent and that's up four percent
 
04:54:31.128 --> 04:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
um from the last uh time we uh um we uh
 
04:54:35.390 --> 04:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
made these charts and uh uh tier four
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
um 62 and go to fair condition the
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
target's 65 and that's actually
 
04:54:40.320 --> 04:54:40.970 align:start position:0%
target's 65 and that's actually
um

04:54:40.970 --> 04:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:44.090 --> 04:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh uh declined a bit since the last time
 
04:54:44.100 --> 04:54:46.010 align:start position:0%
uh uh declined a bit since the last time
overall

04:54:46.010 --> 04:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:54:46.020 --> 04:54:46.610 align:start position:0%
overall
um

04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:49.310 --> 04:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
the overall the the Statewide network is
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
in is in is in really good shape
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
um 80 good Affair that's that's uh
 
04:54:56.330 --> 04:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's that's really good
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and it's up over one percent
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
um in uh since the previous round
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
um but there's also 805 miles that are
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
in poor very poor condition and those
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
we've improved that we've reduced the
 
04:55:12.410 --> 04:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
number of Road mileage that is in uh
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
poor a very poor condition since the
 
04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
last round so overall we're in pretty
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
good shape on the roadway side
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and we need to you know pay attention
 
04:55:24.410 --> 04:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
to the other years on the state
 
04:55:28.128 --> 04:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
investment side uh because
 
04:55:32.690 --> 04:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
um as you see in the next slide slide 29
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
this covers both
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:55:41.448 --> 04:55:41.458 align:start position:0%
Road and Bridge conditions so on the at
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
the top half of the slide there is a is
 
04:55:47.930 --> 04:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
a chart a chart there that shows miles
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
of Road resurfaced over time and it goes
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
from 2013 out to 2031 and in the middle
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
there the the line that's shown changes
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
color from black to Blue so the black
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
portion of the left-hand side of that
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
shows actual miles paved on the
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
Statewide Network
 
04:56:13.128 --> 04:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
and the blue shows what we project to be
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
able to pave with the investment level
 
04:56:17.448 --> 04:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
that we have currently in the draft
 
04:56:18.890 --> 04:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
and note that we've got a a Target
 
04:56:24.170 --> 04:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
mileage of 500 miles plus a minus there
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to uh pave
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
any year and so we've got about 5 000
 
04:56:32.330 --> 04:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
miles of of a road on the Statewide
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
Network try to get into a 10-year cycle
 
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
um so 500 miles is 10 is uh uh 10 of
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
that and so we try to hit that so we get
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
on on a 10-year cycle
 
04:56:46.490 --> 04:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
and if we can pave
 
04:56:48.650 --> 04:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
more than 500 Miles we're going to keep
 
04:56:50.690 --> 04:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
the roads in in pretty good shape if we
 
04:56:52.490 --> 04:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
can't you're going to see a decline in
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
the condition
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
um so overall the conditions for the
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
next four years are expected to be good
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
above 80 percent go to fair and that's
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
above average
 
04:57:05.810 --> 04:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
in the later years because of the the
 
04:57:07.970 --> 04:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
reduction in Miles paved that we are
 
04:57:07.980 --> 04:57:09.170 align:start position:0%
reduction in Miles paved that we are
projecting

04:57:09.170 --> 04:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
04:57:09.180 --> 04:57:09.948 align:start position:0%
projecting
um

04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're expected to decline by 30 to about
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
50 percent good affair
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
and again the tier three and four roads
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
are expected to decline the most with
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
the anticipated decreases in state funds
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that's again
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
um number of miles pave matters and
 
04:57:29.878 --> 04:57:30.890 align:start position:0%
um number of miles pave matters and
certainly

04:57:30.890 --> 04:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
um we we make up more ground by
 
04:57:36.890 --> 04:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
investing Paving on those rural roads
 
04:57:36.900 --> 04:57:38.090 align:start position:0%
investing Paving on those rural roads
um

04:57:38.090 --> 04:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
Below on the second the bottom half of
 
04:57:48.110 --> 04:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
the the slide is a
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
a graphic that shows some State uh the
 
04:57:54.288 --> 04:57:54.298 align:start position:0%
number of uh bridges on the state
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
um uh Red List
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
and so a bridge makes it on to the Red
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
List when it's one of its three major
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
elements receives a four out of uh uh
 
04:58:09.050 --> 04:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
one one out of ten receives a four it's
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a considered poor condition and
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
it makes it on to the red list and and
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
Bridges State bridges are inspected uh
 
04:58:18.530 --> 04:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
once every two years when they make it
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
on the Red List they're inspected once
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
every six months so twice a year
 
04:58:26.650 --> 04:58:26.660 align:start position:0%
and this graphic shows the numbers of
 
04:58:29.810 --> 04:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
bridges on the Red List over time and
 
04:58:30.920 --> 04:58:30.930 align:start position:0%
you see that
 
04:58:30.930 --> 04:58:31.550 align:start position:0%
you see that

[Music]
 
04:58:31.560 --> 04:58:33.590 align:start position:0%

um

04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
as we go from solid red to the the blue
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
dash again right now we're at 118
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
bridges on the state red list and with
 
04:58:46.010 --> 04:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
the investment level that we have
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
included in the draft 10-year plan we
 
04:58:52.010 --> 04:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
expect to push that down to 91 by the
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
end of this draft 10-year plan period by
 
04:58:58.090 --> 04:58:58.100 align:start position:0%
by 2033.
 
04:58:58.100 --> 04:58:58.850 align:start position:0%
by 2033.

[Music]
 
04:58:58.860 --> 04:59:00.530 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:59:00.530 --> 04:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:00.540 --> 04:59:03.708 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.730 --> 04:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
um just one just one question on that
 
04:59:10.128 --> 04:59:10.138 align:start position:0%
projection is that part of a zero-sum
 
04:59:13.250 --> 04:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
game as one comes off and or ten come
 
04:59:16.368 --> 04:59:16.378 align:start position:0%
off and two go on as or are we just
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
starting with the number and saying
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
we're fixing this number and it'll go to
 
04:59:19.320 --> 04:59:23.208 align:start position:0%
we're fixing this number and it'll go to
91.

04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.010 --> 04:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
we look at a number of different uh
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
approaches to project how many bridges
 
04:59:37.128 --> 04:59:37.138 align:start position:0%
are going to come on to the red list and
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
we use some rolling averages over the
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
previous uh five years and we we do a
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
couple of things and try to settle on
 
04:59:48.050 --> 04:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
um what we think is is
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
um you know reasonable to assume
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
um in some cases
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in the past we've assumed that you
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
know 14 are going to come on and and 14
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
didn't come on so that you know part of
 
05:00:05.690 --> 05:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
part of that also is it's difficult to
 
05:00:09.170 --> 05:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
predict how our investments on the
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
preservation side for Bridges is
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
affecting the deterioration of the
 
05:00:16.850 --> 05:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
bridges in general so we've been
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
investing a lot of money on bridge
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
preservation and uh by doing that we're
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
slowing the rate of the the degradation
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
of the condition of the bridges and
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing the number of bridges
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
that are coming on the red list so we're
 
05:00:34.490 --> 05:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
attacking it at both ends and it's it's
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
been fairly successful and it and and I
 
05:00:39.410 --> 05:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
believe it's the right approach uh to
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
take to make those smaller Investments
 
05:00:42.600 --> 05:00:44.330 align:start position:0%
take to make those smaller Investments
early

05:00:44.330 --> 05:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
early
 
05:00:47.570 --> 05:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to waiting to um the worst
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
first type of approach where it takes a
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
lot more money to take that bridge off
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
off the red list and to correct the
 
05:00:54.600 --> 05:01:03.770 align:start position:0%
off the red list and to correct the
deficiencies

05:01:03.770 --> 05:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.780 --> 05:01:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:05.810 --> 05:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:07.970 --> 05:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
 
05:01:10.550 --> 05:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
with relationship to the with the
 
05:01:14.208 --> 05:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
relatives of the Red List Bridges
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
which ones are coming off as far as
 
05:01:17.400 --> 05:01:19.368 align:start position:0%
which ones are coming off as far as
areas

05:01:19.368 --> 05:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:01:21.410 --> 05:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I represent kowas County
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess what I'm concerned with
 
05:01:27.050 --> 05:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
is are the all the bridges on the
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
southern end of the state getting more
 
05:01:30.770 --> 05:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
attention than the bridges in the
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
I I would ask that
 
05:01:43.730 --> 05:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
specific questions be held this was
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be just an orientation on
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
Color of Money and the rest we will have
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
two hearings and two full days of work
 
05:01:55.208 --> 05:01:55.218 align:start position:0%
sessions on this plan to answer those
 
05:01:58.730 --> 05:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
specific questions right now we don't
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
have the plan in front of us to even
 
05:02:03.890 --> 05:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
look at and I understand your concern
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
for anything north of The Notches you
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
would and the former chairman of this
 
05:02:10.368 --> 05:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
committee we're always concerned about
 
05:02:10.378 --> 05:02:11.690 align:start position:0%
committee we're always concerned about
that

05:02:11.690 --> 05:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:02:11.700 --> 05:02:12.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:02:12.530 --> 05:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
but I think it's unfair to the to the
 
05:02:18.830 --> 05:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner to try to answer questions
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
when we don't have
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
everything in front of us to look at
 
05:02:26.690 --> 05:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
what is what is being done and in what
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.730 --> 05:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
the thing I will say is that we strive
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
for equity in terms of the condition
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
across the system so we have a bridge
 
05:02:42.410 --> 05:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
prioritization process so not only do we
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
inspect these Bridges but we're required
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
to rank them in order of priority and so
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's not about how much we're spending
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
in each region of the state we want all
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the bridges that are on the
 
05:02:56.090 --> 05:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
interstate system to be in a good state
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
of repair whether that's a bridge on 93
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
in Littleton or we're talking about a
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
bridge on 93 in Manchester and then
 
05:03:05.810 --> 05:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
likewise as you go down to tiers that
 
05:03:07.850 --> 05:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
Pete described tier one tier two tier
 
05:03:10.490 --> 05:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
three and we're striving for the equity
 
05:03:13.930 --> 05:03:13.940 align:start position:0%
across the state in that classification
 
05:03:16.850 --> 05:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
of roadway and therefore the importance
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
of the bridge as we translate it into
 
05:03:20.208 --> 05:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
the bridge world and we'll get into all
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
of that detail if it's something the
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh that really concludes the our
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
presentation there's a slide here that I
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
identified some topics that we could
 
05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
cover on the next presentation I'm sure
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
we'll be in uh coordination and
 
05:03:51.420 --> 05:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
we'll be in uh coordination and
communication

05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
communication
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
um with with you to make sure that we uh
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
come prepared for the next couple of
 
05:03:58.080 --> 05:03:59.330 align:start position:0%
come prepared for the next couple of
meetings

05:03:59.330 --> 05:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
05:04:01.610 --> 05:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and we will
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
um we'll be able to answer all the
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions and provide you the
 
05:04:06.250 --> 05:04:06.260 align:start position:0%
information that you seek
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
at next week on the 19th in the
 
05:04:11.930 --> 05:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have the first public
 
05:04:15.490 --> 05:04:15.500 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 2022.
 
05:04:18.288 --> 05:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
at that time I would
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
like the department to present
 
05:04:25.368 --> 05:04:25.378 align:start position:0%
a high level of what is in the plan
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
um adjustments that were made because of
 
05:04:30.530 --> 05:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
an increased Federal funding and
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were made as a result
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the gas adhering sort of like you did
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
at the last gas at hearing that kind of
 
05:04:37.740 --> 05:04:38.930 align:start position:0%
at the last gas at hearing that kind of
level

05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:04:41.390 --> 05:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can start and that the public
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
can hear what what the broader public
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
and then whoever is in here to testify
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
also understands what we're starting
 
05:04:51.170 --> 05:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
with before we
 
05:04:56.930 --> 05:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
from those that want to testify you know
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
how long would you like us to present
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
for recognizing that will be the day of
 
05:05:10.610 --> 05:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
the Public Public hearing and you want
 
05:05:13.490 --> 05:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
to hear their testimony more than I I
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
would suggest no more than 30 minutes
 
05:05:16.860 --> 05:05:19.128 align:start position:0%
would suggest no more than 30 minutes
and

05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:19.138 --> 05:05:19.788 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
that I would ask the committee to hold
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
off on the question so the department
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.010 --> 05:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative query
 
05:05:33.410 --> 05:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I had uh one question that
 
05:05:37.310 --> 05:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
stemmed from uh yesterday's Bill hearing
 
05:05:37.320 --> 05:05:39.470 align:start position:0%
stemmed from uh yesterday's Bill hearing
on

05:05:39.470 --> 05:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
um sound barriers and so one thing that
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
arised from that was the uh process in
 
05:05:49.970 --> 05:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.850 --> 05:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
check and see which areas qualify and so
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that the committee could
 
05:05:56.890 --> 05:05:56.900 align:start position:0%
get a copy of
 
05:05:58.970 --> 05:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:06:03.770 --> 05:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
procedure and then also I know that uh
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Cass said that there were some
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
areas that we have more control over and
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
then there are some areas that the
 
05:06:14.448 --> 05:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
federal side regulates
 
05:06:16.490 --> 05:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and if if you could make note of what
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
those where we can't touch and where we
 
05:06:23.090 --> 05:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.490 --> 05:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
I I think you're you're looking for the
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
rules that and criteria that the
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
department uses for
 
05:06:34.190 --> 05:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
um evaluating what what areas are
 
05:06:37.970 --> 05:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
eligible for Sovereign barriers am I
 
05:06:46.090 --> 05:06:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.530 --> 05:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
you can get copies of I think what
 
05:06:50.690 --> 05:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
you're asking for is essentially our uh
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
our noise policy which spells out the
 
05:06:55.730 --> 05:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
criteria in the process um
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
online but I can certainly get hard
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
copies here at the starting point yeah
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be helpful Bill
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
if if members of the committee could see
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
that because the whole sound barrier
 
05:07:12.050 --> 05:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
issue is not going to go away it's not
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
going to go away as we go through the
 
05:07:22.448 --> 05:07:22.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh commissioner
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
and assistant commissioner P because I
 
05:07:31.368 --> 05:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
missed your last name
 
05:07:33.650 --> 05:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
similar to the question that I asked
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
previously regarding turnpike's is there
 
05:07:36.000 --> 05:07:37.610 align:start position:0%
previously regarding turnpike's is there
a

05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
protocol a program regarding how you
 
05:07:43.010 --> 05:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
grade what and prioritizing how roads
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
get paved in the system the ones in the
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
twos like I I kind of would expect a
 
05:07:50.930 --> 05:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
more was kind of looking at the
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
tier three in the tier four roads and I
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
was just you know if unless it's a broad
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
stroke kind of thing I just would
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate some insight thank you so the
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
tier three and four roads are typically
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
funded with the betterment funds that
 
05:08:06.410 --> 05:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
we've discussed earlier and in the
 
05:08:09.230 --> 05:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
betterment law it does describe how the
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
funds are to be allocated across the
 
05:08:11.100 --> 05:08:12.708 align:start position:0%
funds are to be allocated across the
state

05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:08:14.690 --> 05:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned earlier in response to
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson's question we're
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
striving for Equity from a condition
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
perspective and so we'd worked with this
 
05:08:23.570 --> 05:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past to have a little
 
05:08:25.730 --> 05:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
bit more latitude and the cost of doing
 
05:08:28.910 --> 05:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
business can vary across the state and
 
05:08:28.920 --> 05:08:29.770 align:start position:0%
business can vary across the state and
so

05:08:29.770 --> 05:08:29.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
we start by dividing the funds equally
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
but then we have a certain amount that
 
05:08:37.970 --> 05:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
is held back so that we can add funding
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
in this particular region of the state
 
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
as we strive for that equity in terms of
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
condition so as Pete mentioned we drive
 
05:08:45.530 --> 05:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
all the roads we measure the condition
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then we put together these Paving
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
plans and we'll get into all of that
 
05:08:51.050 --> 05:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
detail at a later date with the
 
05:08:52.610 --> 05:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee we do a three-year Paving plan
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
of all the segments we plan to pave in
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
each region based on the initial amounts
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
of money and then we level things out to
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
try and raise the condition across the
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
entire system
 
05:09:08.810 --> 05:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
oh Mr chairman so
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the equity piece
 
05:09:13.368 --> 05:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to reading what what
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
that you go out you go out and you look
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
at it at a variety of variety of
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
different roads
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it you use the you break you split
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
the money evenly and then you prioritize
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
based on which which bucket of money is
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
available for a specific specific SEC
 
05:09:37.628 --> 05:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
you know specific section of the dot
 
05:09:40.368 --> 05:09:40.378 align:start position:0%
within I guess on there I'll narrow it
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
down within we'll just say one section
 
05:09:45.170 --> 05:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
do you do you have a program that says
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
we paved this particular Road on on such
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
a such a date we give it a grade of we
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
went from an I'll talk in transportation
 
05:09:54.530 --> 05:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
terms we went from a level of service
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
from F to D do you have something like
 
05:09:58.610 --> 05:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
that as it relates to your Paving
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
program uh with the set within the
 
05:10:03.170 --> 05:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
sections of the dot for any segment of
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
roadway we can tell you how the
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
condition has changed over time and we
 
05:10:07.490 --> 05:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
also track the projects that we
 
05:10:07.500 --> 05:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
also track the projects that we
completed

05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
completed
 
05:10:09.120 --> 05:10:10.610 align:start position:0%
completed
um so

05:10:10.610 --> 05:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
our pavement management section has all
 
05:10:15.410 --> 05:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
of that data at their fingertips and so
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
we also were able to assess how
 
05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
successful different treatments are
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
because we know when we last paved with
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
that treatment and then how much life
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
expectancy we got
 
05:10:26.090 --> 05:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
um our industry has come a long way in
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
terms of forecasting condition
 
05:10:30.050 --> 05:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
several years ago in one of the federal
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
bills map 21 we were required to start
 
05:10:34.128 --> 05:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
producing Transportation Asset
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
Management plans so we're a lot more
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
data driven in terms of not just
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
measuring condition but then also using
 
05:10:42.050 --> 05:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
all of that data to forecast how the
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
system is going to perform over time and
 
05:10:46.490 --> 05:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
so the veterans on this committee will
 
05:10:48.170 --> 05:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
understand some of our forecasting was
 
05:10:50.570 --> 05:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
rather crude maybe two or three ten year
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
plan Cycles ago but we're becoming more
 
05:10:54.050 --> 05:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
and more sophisticated every time
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
because we're collecting more data so we
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
have more of that information on
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
deterioration rates
 
05:11:02.208 --> 05:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up last follow Mr
 
05:11:04.430 --> 05:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so is there a
 
05:11:06.288 --> 05:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
dashboard on the dot website that has
 
05:11:14.330 --> 05:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.330 --> 05:11:16.340 align:start position:0%
the road that you're interested in
 
05:11:18.530 --> 05:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
we have some of the charts here today
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know the committee's will will pull
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
together whatever additional data or
 
05:11:26.930 --> 05:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
statistics you'd like to see
 
05:11:28.430 --> 05:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner I appreciate you candle
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman you're
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
welcome and I think the the piece that a
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the public
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
has a hard time grasping is that there's
 
05:11:40.128 --> 05:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
the federal eligible the non-federal
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
eligible the turnpike system which can't
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
use any federal funds but that we have
 
05:11:46.080 --> 05:11:47.868 align:start position:0%
use any federal funds but that we have
uh

05:11:47.868 --> 05:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
criteria be being held against it by the
 
05:11:54.288 --> 05:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
bondholders to do certain things with
 
05:11:56.208 --> 05:11:56.218 align:start position:0%
the turnpike that is above and beyond
 
05:11:58.690 --> 05:11:58.700 align:start position:0%
what may happen the tier three and four
 
05:11:58.700 --> 05:12:00.250 align:start position:0%
what may happen the tier three and four
roads

05:12:00.250 --> 05:12:00.260 align:start position:0%
roads
 
05:12:03.288 --> 05:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
so that's a piece that we all have to
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
get a grasp on so that we can explain it
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
not only to our constituents but to our
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives who really don't
 
05:12:15.170 --> 05:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
dig into the 10-year plan or how it's
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
funded they just know that there's
 
05:12:20.090 --> 05:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars out there and why is
 
05:12:28.810 --> 05:12:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.550 --> 05:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
as we um you know wrapped up we showed
 
05:12:33.288 --> 05:12:33.298 align:start position:0%
you the condition of the system and one
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the questions we get often is it
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
looks like you're making great strides
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
with respect to Bridge condition you
 
05:12:39.530 --> 05:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
know why aren't you taking some of the
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
money and spending it on Pavements but
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know as we've tried to describe
 
05:12:42.600 --> 05:12:43.610 align:start position:0%
you know as we've tried to describe
today

05:12:43.610 --> 05:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
we can use federal funds even on some of
 
05:12:48.530 --> 05:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
the what they call off system Bridges
 
05:12:50.690 --> 05:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
but we can't use federal funds on off
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
system roadways and so
 
05:12:55.730 --> 05:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I always say to this committee that
 
05:12:57.170 --> 05:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
you're really prioritizing projects
 
05:12:58.970 --> 05:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
within each of these categories as
 
05:13:00.288 --> 05:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
opposed to looking at all of our
 
05:13:02.830 --> 05:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
transportation needs and
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
prioritizing Things based on where we
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
have the worst condition or
 
05:13:07.920 --> 05:13:08.810 align:start position:0%
have the worst condition or
um

05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
and we believe the investment should be
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
made because it's it's all going to be
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
done in compliance with the laws around
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.690 --> 05:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
the one thing I want to Circle back to
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Eden's question about the
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
Surplus process and when we sell
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
equipment the folks in Maryland Transit
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
did Circle back with us and I was
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
mistaken the funding is restricted when
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
we sell a bus that has passed its useful
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
life we are able to take that money and
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
put it back into a Transit account and
 
05:13:47.570 --> 05:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
use it for the rest of our Transit
 
05:13:47.580 --> 05:13:49.310 align:start position:0%
use it for the rest of our Transit
programs

05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative query
 
05:13:55.010 --> 05:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I will just stay I'm not sure if this
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate time so I look to
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
your guidance Mr chair if this is
 
05:13:57.840 --> 05:13:59.208 align:start position:0%
your guidance Mr chair if this is
appropriate

05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:14:01.250 --> 05:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I had a couple constituents reach out
 
05:14:04.430 --> 05:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
to me uh due to the ice storm that we
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
saw last week with some of the issues of
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
were we unprepared for the 90 the state
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
of condition that 93 was going to be in
 
05:14:18.650 --> 05:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
or were we really just kind of caught
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
off guard by how bad that storm was
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
mainly a lot of people were saying well
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
why did it take an hour and a half to
 
05:14:29.690 --> 05:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
to get the road salted and and gritted
 
05:14:33.530 --> 05:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it gridded prior to that so
 
05:14:33.540 --> 05:14:35.090 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it gridded prior to that so
perhaps

05:14:35.090 --> 05:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh clarification so I can answer knowing
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
that the department is is uh tight when
 
05:14:44.810 --> 05:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
it comes to plow plowing and all that
 
05:14:47.208 --> 05:14:47.218 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so every winter weather
 
05:14:49.610 --> 05:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
event is different it all comes down to
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
the type of precipitation the time of
 
05:14:55.850 --> 05:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
day as well as uh
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
the road temperatures and the air
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
temperatures so we've had a lot of this
 
05:15:05.150 --> 05:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
wintry mix freezing rain turning over to
 
05:15:07.550 --> 05:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
sleet and unfortunately we haven't had
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
that much snow it's actually easier for
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
us to plow and treat during snowstorms
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
I think the day that you're referring to
 
05:15:14.878 --> 05:15:16.368 align:start position:0%
I think the day that you're referring to
um

05:15:16.368 --> 05:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:20.030 --> 05:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
when the precipitation first started you
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
could barely see that rain was falling
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
it was um almost like a mist and so we
 
05:15:28.490 --> 05:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
had been out treating earlier in the
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
morning but there hadn't been enough
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
traffic when we put salt out it takes
 
05:15:32.930 --> 05:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
some time for that salt to break down
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
and work into the roadway and so as the
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes picked up it was just
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
the worst possible situation the
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
temperatures were such that um we'd had
 
05:15:45.410 --> 05:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
a very cold spell the road was extremely
 
05:15:47.330 --> 05:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
cold and then the air temperature was
 
05:15:49.250 --> 05:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
warming and so when it started as a fine
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
Mist I think motorists didn't even
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
realize it was doing anything and they
 
05:15:55.250 --> 05:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
were still driving at the faster speeds
 
05:15:56.930 --> 05:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
so we got caught a little bit with a
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
couple of accidents early on from
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
individuals who just were driving too
 
05:16:02.690 --> 05:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
fast for the conditions because the
 
05:16:05.810 --> 05:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
storm was just beginning and then trying
 
05:16:07.250 --> 05:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
to get our trucks through and then treat
 
05:16:08.930 --> 05:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
segments once you've had some accidents
 
05:16:11.090 --> 05:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
is challenging even though you know when
 
05:16:12.650 --> 05:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're right at the accent scene law
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement can help us get in it was
 
05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
just several factors the time of day
 
05:16:19.788 --> 05:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
with the traffic building and so we were
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
out there
 
05:16:24.050 --> 05:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of Articles even
 
05:16:26.570 --> 05:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
in newspapers and neighboring states I
 
05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
think Connecticut experienced the same
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
thing parts of Massachusetts and you can
 
05:16:34.368 --> 05:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
go just 10 miles over and the it's a
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
slightly warmer air temperature and a
 
05:16:38.930 --> 05:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
very different road conditions and so it
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
is challenging for our team and once we
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
have some accents is out there like I
 
05:16:45.230 --> 05:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
said that's a another hurdle that we
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
have to overcome and trying to get to
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
the locations and we can't have a
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction and take a truck and
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
send it to where we're hearing a report
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
of icing because that would leave other
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
roads untreated so we try to keep to our
 
05:16:59.350 --> 05:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
beats and our routes as much as we can
 
05:17:02.090 --> 05:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
so we just ask everyone you know always
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to the weather that
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
morning I know I stepped out onto my own
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
driveway it looked like it was dry and
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was very very slick of course it was
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
not treated like our roads were so there
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.170 --> 05:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:24.050 --> 05:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh commissioner we
 
05:17:25.850 --> 05:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate you and the team being here
 
05:17:29.470 --> 05:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
it was helpful to get started on
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
understanding some of the changes in the
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
funding especially
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
um since as you are finishing up the
 
05:17:40.970 --> 05:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
gassed hearings and trying to finalize
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the draft 10-year plan Congress
 
05:17:46.368 --> 05:17:46.378 align:start position:0%
who is finally passing the
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
reauthorization bill with additional
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
funding in it so it it is helpful for us
 
05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
to have a start point of understanding
 
05:17:58.490 --> 05:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
where you are and as you know with this
 
05:18:01.610 --> 05:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
committee once we get into the actual
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
well why is this and this year uh why
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
was this dropped or why was it moved
 
05:18:07.320 --> 05:18:08.170 align:start position:0%
was this dropped or why was it moved
back

05:18:08.170 --> 05:18:08.180 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
those questions will all come from not
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
just us but there will be be addressed
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
to us by members of of the public
 
05:18:21.170 --> 05:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
whether our own constituents are not but
 
05:18:24.050 --> 05:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's been helpful to have you here and
 
05:18:26.750 --> 05:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
at least get us started before the first
 
05:18:29.330 --> 05:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I've I I personally
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I think this committee is an
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunate position the timing of the
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill we were able to do a
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
lot of the initial work with the
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
executive Council in the gassett phase
 
05:18:43.730 --> 05:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
and we had made some assumptions based
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
on the conversations in Congress around
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
future funding and so while we were
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
programming additional dollars at the
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
end of the process we weren't having to
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
program all of the new money we had been
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
staying current with what we were
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on Capitol Hill so luckily we
 
05:18:59.330 --> 05:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
have programmed the majority of the
 
05:19:01.368 --> 05:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
funds so for this committee it's more
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
about identifying
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
priorities and moving some things around
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're relieved that the Lion's Share of
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
the work has been done to at least
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
establish the core programs and get the
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.170 --> 05:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.050 --> 05:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
but I think that's it
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
okay for the members of the committee
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
who are here or listening I know some of
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
the ones who are under the weather we're
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
going to listen in we do meet next week
 
05:19:36.530 --> 05:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday the 19th in the morning we
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
hear a couple of uh bills on on
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
Road usage uh fees
 
05:19:47.410 --> 05:19:47.420 align:start position:0%
um and we will see what we do with those
 
05:19:49.310 --> 05:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:19:49.320 --> 05:19:50.090 align:start position:0%
and then
um

05:19:50.090 --> 05:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
removing a roll temp roll
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh RAB tool and hook set another loss of
 
05:20:01.010 --> 05:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue and establishing a surcharge on
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
easy pass for electric vehicles all of
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
which we hear next Wednesday morning and
 
05:20:09.050 --> 05:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
early afternoon before we get into the
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I know that the commissioner
 
05:20:15.490 --> 05:20:15.500 align:start position:0%
has said that she would have
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people sitting in the back
 
05:20:21.470 --> 05:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
as we go through all of those so that if
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
there are specific questions that we
 
05:20:26.330 --> 05:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
would be able to ask the the department
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
just as we were this morning on on the
 
05:20:31.610 --> 05:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
railroad so commissioner again I
 
05:20:34.010 --> 05:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support to the committee
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
and and the bills as they come through
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
because without the expertise sitting
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
there sometimes we could go off in a
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
direction that would be less desirable
 
05:20:47.868 --> 05:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
so I will see the committee next week
 
05:20:54.410 --> 05:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
um think about what we're going to do
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the rail Bill and some of the others
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
because we do have to exec those bills
