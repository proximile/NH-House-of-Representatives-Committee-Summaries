I just asked I don't see you
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
yeah I saw yeah especially if you know
 
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 align:start position:0%
what the bill does we would be very
 
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.949 align:start position:0%
what the bill does we would be very
[Laughter]

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
interested

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay so just tell us your name and
 
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
then and push the red button there you
 
00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 align:start position:0%
go there uh my name is Tracy Sirles
 
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
okay um our family is the one that
 
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
brought forward to try and get this HB
 
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.350 align:start position:0%
brought forward to try and get this HB
187

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
187
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
going um yeah closer to the microphone
 
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
oh sorry um should I speak about what
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
happened and put us this far in well
 
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
just tell us first of all what what so
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is take Crossing off uh a
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
member of the Minor's family or
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
household uh or the words family or
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
household so it's making too little
 
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
changes yeah so what our family had come
 
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
into for an issue was something had
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
happened to one of my children and um
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
when we reported the crime the state
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
police told us to get a restraining
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
order so I went to the court to do that
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
and in doing so the judge said I'm sorry
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
I I can't do this for you my hands are
 
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
tied because of the way that the law is
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
written um currently only a parent or
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
guardian of a child um can get a
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
restraining or on behalf of their child
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
if the uh perpetrator was a member of
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
their household or related to them the
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
person who committed these crimes
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
against my child was not a family member
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
and not related to us in any way so
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I cannot get a restraining
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
order to keep my family safe so you
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about like a teacher or
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
something like that or is it uh no this
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
this was my child's best friend's father
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
gotcha um this has nothing to do with
 
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
teachers and stuff like that this is
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
just some other person yes and
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't protect my
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
children in this case because of the way
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
the law is written
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay um any
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions so uh the bill says
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase of a small
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money and I assume that's
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
because there might be some more court
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
cases is that what we're talking about
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
here yes that's correct uh the judicial
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
branch wasn't didn't know how many um
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
additional court cases would come from
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
this so they just gave an estimated
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
range but it could be on the lower end
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
however there is no appropriation for
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
this so if this were to pass it
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
something they would just need to um
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
absorb into their budget yeah okay so um
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
what do you think should we should we is
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't look like the sort of
 
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
thing that should be part of house bill
 
00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
to I mean just just pass the bill and we
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
done with it yeah no appropriation
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact the budget okay so would
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
someone like to move out to pass on the
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion ought to pass okay
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a motion by um
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative C seconded by
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative rang that house bill 187
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
be recommended ought to pass any further
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
discussion no okay represent Ms um I
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
mean to me it it it just seems like it
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense I mean uh I I I guess the
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
only question I would have and I don't
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a deal breaker is why was the
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
limitation put there in the first place
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but presumably the children and
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
family law committee considered all that
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing no I I think it's a it's
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
like a no-brainer yes right okay that's
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
why we're going so quick representative
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham I I was just going to ask what
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
passed uh on um cons Melissa can
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
last time uh the committee discussed
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
this we had a pretty full discussion I I
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
don't really have anything to add I'm
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
just happy to if you have questions
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
about things um that's what I wanted to
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
be here to try to answer any questions
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you remind us sort of as
 
00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
to what's going on oh
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah what's going on with this fil so
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
what 66 um did was it
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
expanded um the um
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
the availability of people to be able to
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
get information under the right to no
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
law and it and it it did that in two
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
basic ways first it as you may recall
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of sections in the
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
right to no law not all of them but a
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
couple of sections that refer to the
 
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
couple of sections that refer to the
term

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
citizen as opposed to the term person
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
which was used in most other places in
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
the rights of Noah
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
and uh that as
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
that had never been an issue as far as I
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
know and I I don't have I don't have I
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't recall ever having anybody say
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
anything to the contract that had never
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
been an issue in terms of being a
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
restriction on somebody being able to
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
get access to information covered by the
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
right to no law until a situation arose
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
in Rochester which I think we discussed
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
the last time of there's a there's a
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
a media uh person that covers Roch local
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
politics in Rochester and I forgot he
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
has a you know some kind of an an
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
electronic publication that covers
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
Rochester but he lives he personally
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
lives just across the border in Maine
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
and he tried to get some information oh
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and Rochester said nope you can't
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
get it because you're not a citizen
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
right so he went to court he he ended up
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
going to the superior court and there
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
was a long there was a very good
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
decision by judge will that basically
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
said no you're wrong
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
um citizen doesn't mean um what didn't
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean what you what what you the
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
town of Rochester or its Council said um
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
but anyway that raised the issue of you
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
know why does why is this why is this
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
term in there at all we we took it out
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it does is um it
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
allows um people that are that have a
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire connection they're either
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
a citizen of New Hampshire they do
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
business here they own property here
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they pay taxes here those
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
people are allowed to request
 
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.870 align:start position:0%
people are allowed to request
information

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
electronically and and if the town or
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
state or whatever whoever the
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
governmental body does is if they have
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
if they have the information in the
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
format that's requested they have to
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
provide it in that format um and that I
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
think that makes a lot of sense okay the
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would say is there the
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
reason we limited that the ability to
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
request and receive electronically to
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire is uh concern
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
by some and I I don't mean to I think
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate concern that you know
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
if we didn't do that somebody you know
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
somebody sitting in their bedroom and
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
Beijing in the middle of the night might
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
say I'd love to know what uh what Epsom
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
has you know what the communications are
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
between the police and fire departments
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
and epsom send me all your emails and
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
we'd have to provide it and that
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
presumably would have a cost and you
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
know we didn't want to impose that cost
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay so I I remember two two things we
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
talked about here so on on page one line
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
26 member of the media there was some
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
people who said how can you fig you know
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's impossible to know that
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
somebody is a member of the media
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
because they could a blogger they could
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
be a whatever you know what there there
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
is a the there is a
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
definition of that not in not in this
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
bill because it doesn't Che but there's
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
a definition of that in uh the bill we P
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
the compromise Bill we passed last year
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I can't recite it off the
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
top of my head but there is a definition
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
of member of the media in that okay and
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
and is it something that um towns can
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you know it does just so you
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
know it does it it doesn't mean you have
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be like you know the conquered
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
monitor or the union leader it it would
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
it would Encompass more informal but
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
they still have to be you know they
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
still have to have some some kind of
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
proof some kind of uh for lack of a
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
better term credential maybe credential
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
is a wrong word but some some legitimacy
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
and I forgot I wish I had the language
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I don't all right and
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
then the other point was on page two uh
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
line 17 we just we I didn't like the
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
fact that it says appeals shall have no
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
filing fee or search charge did we make
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
an amendment for that
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
Melissa no nope we didn't address it
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
okay that you know that again I I I
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
would say you know completely candidly
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's if you guys want to change that's
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
not a beach I would want to die on I
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
think we did that because as part of the
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
you know the uh the effort to make it as
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
easy as possible for someone who thought
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
they were being denied information we
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
thought that taking that out but you
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
know I as I say I understand the the
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal situation we have and if you guys
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
want to change it I'm not you're not
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
going to get any objection from me okay
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
so would people be okay with this bill
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
without that line well let's ask the
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
question it what's happening to do the
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note again doesn't really affect
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the budget is
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
that ta is correct but I also want to
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure you guys have the correct
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does your top say as amended
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
as amended yes but it's all interminable
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
inter terminable indetermined yeah so so
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder is correct unless
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
you want to put some funding in here
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact the budget uh the
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
right to no office would just absorb
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
these costs okay into their current
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin um thank you for taking the
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
question um I I'm really a supporter of
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh the right to know and I don't think
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate fees for someone to get
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
information from the government it's one
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
thing to duplicate the cost if you have
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
to if you have to produce stuff but just
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
to have a fee to file I don't I don't
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
believe is right so the thank you for
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the point but what we're talking about
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
here is an appeal to court from the
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's ruling so you've already
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
gone to the Ombudsman he made a he
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
looked at your case ruled against you
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
and now you say well the heck with the
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I'm going to go to court right
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't we generally don't wave
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
court fees I would think I mean I guess
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
we do now in this particular case but um
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I I feel really strongly about the
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
right to know and I don't know whether
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement you go to the on
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
busman first us but no no you can I
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
think you can go either to the on busman
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
or to Supreme Court the only the only
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
thing and this this again it's not in
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
here it's in the bill we passed last
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
year I believe in the bill we passed
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
last year if you there's a provision
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
that says you know if you ask for
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
certain information the town can give
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
you an estimate of the cost and if you
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
challenge that then I think for that
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
only you do have to go to the udman
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
but uh you know to the udman first and
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
then the court for everything else it's
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
you can go to the udman or you can go to
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
court okay yeah so we we've already so
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
in the past people who were challenging
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
the right to no law had to go to court
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
right and when they went to court they
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
paid a fee right and so
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
um now we have yet another we have an
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
intermediate step that's much cheaper
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
right because the ombudsman's fee is
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
much less than the court fee um even
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
though we may be changing it but but the
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
point is you know already we're saving
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
you money right so compared to earlier
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
situation so anyways you can we can
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
propose it then you can vote against it
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
I guess um all right yes representa Ms
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for coming in
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
and I I I think we may have talked about
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
this when you were in but I can't
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
remember if we talked about it uh before
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
or after you you testified but we heard
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
from a representative from the
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department that um um
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
providing records
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
electronically is a is a new requirement
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that that could add significantly to
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
the expense incurred by um uh local
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
local authorities particularly smaller
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
authorities that maybe don't have
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
scanning equipment and and all that all
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
that good stuff um can you clarify
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether if someone comes in and asks for
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
the records electronically that it has
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be provided electronically no it has
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
it it it has to be provided
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
electronically if they have the records
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
electronically but it doesn't require
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
scanning in other words if you if a if a
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
let's say a smaller Police Department
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
only has paper records and I I make a
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
request and say I want I want you to
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
send me this electronically the police
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
Department doesn't have to do they can
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
say no the only thing we have we only
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
have electronic record I mean we only
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
have paper records and if you want the
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
records you know we're going to copy
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
them for you but there's a charge for
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
for doing that so it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
require uh you creating electronic
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
records that don't otherwise exist um um
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
so thank you for clarifying that I'm
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that's clear in the
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill whether we need something that says
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
that specifically that cuz I don't see
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
that what what you described I think is
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
great but I don't see that in the in the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
wording of the bill that says it um it
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
only has to be provided if the if the
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
records are available electronically you
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
know I thought it I don't I wish I don't
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
have the bill right I apologize I don't
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of me maybe I'm
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
missing it but um but but there may be
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the right to know right
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
right let me um because we don't have
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
letter the reference to you know
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
providing the records electronically
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
that I see in here is on page it's on
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
the first page lines 29 through
 
00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:49.470 align:start position:0%
the first page lines 29 through
31

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um top of page two right right L
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
lines four five and six I think yes
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
right exactly no that's what I that's
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I think it does I think
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
it does say they they only have to only
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
have to provide in the format they have
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to recommend an
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that just removes the sentence
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
on page two line 17 appeals shall have
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
no filing fee or sear charge and
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise ought to pass okay um we've
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
had a little discussion on it but
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative Campell yeah thank you Mr
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
chair um on this issue I tend to agree
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
with representative Griffin uh I when it
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
comes to right to know I'd rather air on
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
the side of the citizen than than with
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
the government and uh it's a small price
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to pay to have transparency so um I
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
would I would be uh not uh in accordance
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
with that okay anybody else represented
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
wer I would support it especially since
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
we said to the court system you need to
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
raise your filing fees we need to get in
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
more money to support the court system
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else okay so everybody know what
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment um this will be uh again
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee that was set up and
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
I had sent him some Communications

saying that um for that bill what we
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to do do is remove that language

or that
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation and um since uh HB 215
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
um uh what we call the lovingly the
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
harms and benefits
 
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.549 align:start position:0%
harms and benefits
bill

00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
um we were just in conversation with uh
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
Dees and the governor's office regarding
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh incorporating more of that language
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
into the trailer
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
Bill uh and so there's going to be some
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to that trailer Bill language
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
coming to you to the finance committee
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind but what I guess
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
we're here today is to discuss
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
hb25 alone or H how how do you proceed
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
with that if this is if this is going to
 
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
be part of house build 2 I think we
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
should retain house build 215 uh yes I
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
would we would be very much okay with
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
that okay absolutely and then and then
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
we can once you have all your ducks in a
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
row uh come back and talk about the
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
whole package right about the the uh
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill language yes unless but
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like you you don't
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
have it yet right so no we're we're
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
working on the changes to to the trailer
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bill language which will incorporate
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
more of hb25 into it so yeah so all so
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
how about we have a motion to retain
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 215 representative Griffin
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
and seconded by representative run all
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
right okay any uh further discussion on
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
this one representative run thank you Mr
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Arn and
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
representative gerana will the amendment
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
that you're going to bring to us for
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 I understand will incorporate some
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
of the elements of 215 what about the
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
other two bills so um the other bill was
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
HB 171 which is uh what we call the
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
moratorium Bill uh which is Seeking a
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
three-year moratorium on landfill
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
permits um and the the language in the
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
trailer bill is Seeking a one-year
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium I spoke with the governor
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday and she was okay with a
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
three-year moratorium and so that l
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
language is also going to be worked into
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh the trailer bill um
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
so HB 171 is not coming to your
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee I think that that's just off
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
to the senate senate land and well we
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
can make um House Bill two happen after
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
the effective date of that right so we
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
can make H House Bill two be the master
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
if if that's what you want right so sure
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sure as long as that you know
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the moratorium langu you could put
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
all those things together in one right
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
big block right right yeah and the other
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill was U
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
hb77 which is a landfill sighting bill
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
which um I don't know
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's some consideration for
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
some landfill sighting in uh the trailer
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
Bill language as well
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
but not the entire thing and I know hb77
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
is not coming to your
 
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:35.669 align:start position:0%
is not coming to your
committee

00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know I think that that's
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
going to go separately to the
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
Senate and whatever elements of that is
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to be put in the trailer bill will
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
be there too okay but repres uh so but
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
we we're expecting from you it's just an
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
amendment regarding 215 and then we
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
would if we want to amend hb2 to a
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
dominate the threee moratorium no no
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to be giving you language or
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
we're working with Dees to give you
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
language to amend what's in the trailer
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill which will incorporate a bunch of
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
the other things so the other bills are
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
sort of separate except for 215 which
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
you are going to uh make a decision to
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
retain for us thank you yeah Melissa do
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have a sense of how the budget is
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
affected if we adopt the language from
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
215 versus what's already in the house
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
build too um that would be something I'm
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
asking Melissa oh okay I would just say
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
it seems like the biggest differences is
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
that with HB and you can correct me if
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong with h this 215 uh Dees is
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
requesting additional positions they're
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
not um 2115 doesn't authorize the
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
positions or fund the positions so if
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
you wanted to move forth with the 215
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
we'd want to probably put language in
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
there to authorize the positions and
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
fund those positions if that's the setup
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
your doing versus I believe hb2 is the
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
commission and I don't think you need
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
additional positions for that section so
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's a self-funded correct so that
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's the the biggest um Financial
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
change is an hb2 itself SF funded Dees
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need positions 215 Dees is
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for and would need
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
additional positions in funding to
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
handle this new
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
element okay so yeah go ahead
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record uh Nick tra
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
chesher 15 uh yeah so when the committee
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
looked at the first version of of HB 215
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note was uh indeterminate uh
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
it was you know between zero and 100,000
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
but through the amendment process uh
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
apparently Dees then went back and
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
looked after we had amended the bill and
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
then this new fiscal note with the two
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
positions was added and that was another
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
reason why uh the chairwoman and I were
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
thinking would be appropriate to retain
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bill uh is because we want to try to
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
meld what we have in hp215 into the
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill uh but then hold 215 you
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
know just in case but that that fiscal
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
note was added after we we never saw it
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
when we heard the bill okay so we're
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
very reluctant to add positions and
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
spend more money so if what you give us
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
later does
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a risk it won't happen at
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
all so
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly one of the things that
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
were're we've been talking with Dees
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
about uh and thinking about the
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal and uh yes sir we
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
aware of those concerns and and want to
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
make them go away okay excellent all
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
right so we're about to vote on whether
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
to retain House Bill 2115 is there any
 
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.590 align:start position:0%

bill that uh I worked very closely with
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
Dees to craft the language for and uh
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
our committee did you know a lot of
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
great work sessions to to get it uh
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
where you see it here uh you know as
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
we're all aware we have had a number of
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
issues recently with leech a problems
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
particularly because of uh heavier rains
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
when we get you know two once in a
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
century floods within a couple of years
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh lee8 builds up in the in the layers
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
you know those liner layers within a
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
landfill that needs needs to be siphoned
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
off it needs to be transported it needs
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
to be treated uh before disposal uh and
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to require
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
anyone who is applying for landfill
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
permit to include with that application
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
a detailed plan for how they are going
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
to manage the lee8 uh onsite if they're
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
going to do any on-site treatment which
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
for example TurnKey does in Rochester uh
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
to to make it clear that they have re
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
they have contracts with more than one
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh party to dispose of the lee8 in a
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
safe and responsible way uh and so the
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill has to do with
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
the lee8 plan itself and then the last
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
few lines have to do with requiring the
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
reporting of contracts to to Dees so
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
right now uh companies have to report to
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
Dees that they have contracts this
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
language which again worked out with
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
Dees uh requires a little bit more
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
information about what is contained
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
within those contracts to make sure
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
again that uh safety is the the primary
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
concern with the transportation and
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
disposal of leech
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
a okay um so Melissa what's the
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
bill this
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
one came out of um environment and
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture with to pass with
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it went to the floor and
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote okay all right so
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
um anybody have any
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
Griffin I'd like to know um how did the
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh unanimous 13 to zero ought
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
to pass with
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay represent rung um Mr

amendment oh no but it was amended at a
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
committee it's not going to be amended
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
out of this committee so just OTP okay
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
all right I'll second that all right so
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
moved by representative rung to
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
recommend House Bill
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%

any further
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
discussion no seeing none all those
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
Melissa can I just pause for one second
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
can we just verify with Dees I don't
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
have an updated fiscal note for this
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
revised Bill I'm assuming it doesn't
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
change but I just wanted to bring that
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
up before you guys make idea is there
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yes uh for the record Mike
 
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
whimet director of the waste division
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
for the dees um yeah that we have a a
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
working fiscal impact worksheet on that
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
that essentially uh establishes no
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
specific fiscal impact um Beyond um to
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
the extent that
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh trying to I've got a lot of them in
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
my head right now no I think this one
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
there would be no impact certainly it's
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
to State revenues or or uh or
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures right what the fiscal notes
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
says is that only if somebody submits
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
one of these applications then you have
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
to review it right so then there's some
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
cost right but our expectation is that
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
we would use existing staff to do that
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
in in fact that this bill what it
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
describes in in large part already
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
happens what is not explicit is that um
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
under the current law the uhu the
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
operator of a lfi is required to have
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
these particular agreements for
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
management of their leech a and to
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
produce them to de guess if we request
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
them what this law will change is that
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
those agreements the details of the
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
agree those agreements need to be
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
provided upfront with in the application
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
process so the the the we do not
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate any impacts to to yeah and
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
plus there's a there's a moratorium
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
right or we're thinking there will be
 
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.550 align:start position:0%
right or we're thinking there will be
and

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
therefore there won't be any of these
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
applications and there you know anyway
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
well to yeah and it's a little Nuance to
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
the extent that expansions will still be
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowed depending on the circumstance
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
we even for an expansion you would need
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
the op would need to provide that
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
information very good any other no okay
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
all those in
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
favor okay very
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
good anything else from environment and
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
sir just for the record Adam kpo with
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to comment on the back and
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
forth on 215 in in hb2 the amendment
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we're planning to bring forward
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
with the ENA committee won't have a
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for new positions it would
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
the duties that that 215 was planning to
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
charge the department with would be now
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
under this new SEC proposal and that SEC
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
is proposed to be self-funded through
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
filing fees and so there would not be a
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal impact to the department or
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund or any of that it would
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
just be uh the new filing fees as are in
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
currently hb2 so just wanted to note
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that uh to assade those concerns so okay
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're very happy perfect thank anything
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%

see we got uh minor child Hampton
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach no I think 624 624 624
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
local River Management advisory
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
committee grant
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
you save
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
$10,000 I'm sorry 20 looks like 20 yeah
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
20 all right so is someone here
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
from Dees to talk about
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
no so just just looking at the bill um
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I just pulled up the fiscal note so
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
you know we would we would be able to um
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
adopt rules for this you know there's no
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
funding provided for de's administrative
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
costs and we're saying that uh it would
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
$99,000 fiscal impact for FY 26 and a
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
$10,500 impact for FY
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
27 um we we would be able to abor absorb
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
those costs with existing staff so um
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
and what basically what the
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
program does is is give us um some
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
funding $40,000 for uh fiscal year 2027
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
and and the same for fiscal year 2026
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
and we would administer those grants to
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
local uh River Management advisory
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
committees but this is
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
um oh so this is a straightup
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation for a new grant program
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
right right we have some other things
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
like that in our
 
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.870 align:start position:0%
like that in our
pile

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
pile
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
so I think this probably needs to be
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
retained yeah system yes that because
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
we've retained all these other ones and
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
then we have to at the end of the day
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
maybe see if there's a few bucks in the
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
pile right for for those things
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you um Mr kbo
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today um could you
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
River advisory commissions provide the
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%

00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know the Lakes associations do do
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
provide um a benefit when it comes to
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria and various other um
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
contaminants of con concern like storm
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
water they do provide feedback to us for
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
our rules but under this grant program
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
um The Advisory committees would would
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it basically be a pass
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
through Grant to those to those Rivers
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
advisory committees and they would be
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
able to um you know administer it and
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
and provide a benefit in the form of um
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know cleanup activities and
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
activities around um
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
uh contaminants of concerns so um I and
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
I can I can get more information to the
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee I wasn't prepared to talk
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
about this one specifically today so I
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
can get I know obviously I understand
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
what the uh R local River Management
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
advisory committees do but um happy to
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
provide more information about the bill
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
itself self in and in the fiscal note I
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
see there's a there's a revised one that
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
that came in so I can get some more
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
information if that would be helpful do
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know anything about how they get
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
fund how first of all how much funds do
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
they all these such
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
committees have in their in their
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
budgets and then where does that come
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
from are these federal grants are these
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
local property taxes are these I can get
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
you uh a listing of any of the yeah
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
donations uh likely for a lot of these
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
but I can get you an accounting of of
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
any Pastor grants that we currently
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
provide to them if that would be helpful
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
and uh any of the federal grants that
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
they might receive um you know there's
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of funding for
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
this this type of activity in the state
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently so um this would provide a
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
benefit although it is it it is $40,000
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
so um you know of and it looks like it
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
would be a general fund expense so you
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
know I obviously I know the committee's
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
grappling with thank thank you Mr
 
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.710 align:start position:0%
grappling with thank thank you Mr
chairman

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in um just U you
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
know the chairman mentioned that this
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be new funding and I I agree it
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
would be new funding but you know in the
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill it talks about the fact that this
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be funding that would allow the
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the committee to fulfill the
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that were established
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
in statute so um you know if we're going
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
to if we're going to ask somebody to do
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
something you know theoretically we need
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
to give them the resources to do it
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
right and he's going to find out if
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
they're already getting some any sort of
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
resources from from us we administer
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
many different programs so I want to
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
make sure I get you the correct
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
information okay representative R and um
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
I would also be interested in learning
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
um some of the resources they provide
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
the department um for example I know in
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
in certain Lake Associations water set
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
associations they do a lot of testing
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
they'll deliver samples to the state um
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
I suspect the rivers commission's
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably do the same thing where they
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
might be sampling for cyano bacteria
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
that are in rivers um and you know
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
probably doing some projects on for
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
example Culvert replacement or Culvert
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance that actually saves the
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
state from expending those funds on
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
those projects that's right we do most
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
of our sampling efforts you know this
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
our staff does them but uh we also get a
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
lot of that from volunteers from these
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
types of committees and lakes
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
associations so there there is an
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
extensive effort out there on a
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer basis to provide us
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
information about the water quality in
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and so there is an
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
extensive um effort there okay thank you
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
that I definitely would support but
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
given the current fiscal situation uh
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'm making a motion to retain for the
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%

um and this bill would provide the
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
commission with a small sum of $5,000 in
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
each of the two years to enable it to
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
carry out out its Duty um the mechanism
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
in the bill is that um we would be
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
creating a um Hampton Beach master plan
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
fund and then um that fund would be um
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh General funds would be
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated to that um every uh every
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
year in the amount of
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
$5,000 so I'm happy to take any
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
questions all right questions
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you Mr chairman
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation forward so I know at
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
the local level for towns and cities
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
when they go through a master plan
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
process the Consulting fees and the
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
costs are are usually north of
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so $5,000 a year for a master
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
plan for Hampton Beach is
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
adequate um
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know I'm quite honestly I'm not sure
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
where that where the funding for that
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
came from but I know that it has been
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
developed already this is really just to
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
allow the the commit the the commission
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
to just carry on its normal course of
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
business so is there sorry follow up go
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
ahead do we have other funds in the
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
budget already going towards Hampton
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
Beach not that not towards this
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%

commission asked the town for this money
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
or is that inappropriate somehow well
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's a state
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
agency um and um oh it's a state agency
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
Rivers management
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
advisory grant
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
program okay I I just had 624 yeah I I
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead you want to just discuss it a
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
little more is it yeah I mean well I
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
mean I pulled up just some and I don't
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
know if these are things that have come
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
up if anybody else knows anything but
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
there is a New Hampshire Rivers
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee it looks
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
like it's very active and um uh does
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
some significant um uh tracking of
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and have ongoing Zoom
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
meetings I'm not sure if we were kind of
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
aware of that or um uh and
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um uh you know and so the the committee
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
Grant is it to go to support this
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee or is it for purposes that
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
that they then would
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
um what it's the way the bill is written
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
is it create it creates 4 ,000 Grant
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
fund for two years but it says that no
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
individual committee can get a grant
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
larger than $10,000 okay so there has to
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
be a minimum of four grants made or more
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay right so it can't be just that one
 
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.829 align:start position:0%
okay right so it can't be just that one
I

00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
guess yeah but um so are the and these
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
are organizations that have been helpful
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
to us so far that's what we're told but
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
Dees is going to get us some more
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
information represent run yeah I can
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit um this is a
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide um commission committee but it
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
it serves many local River associations
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
and I know in marac we have a San River
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
um uh committee we have marac River
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee I know the Mary meeting River
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee which I'm not quite sure what
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
town they're based in but they do a lot
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
of work because they've had they've been
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
impacted by cyano bacteria over the
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
years so these kind of Grants will help
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
them maybe to buy equipment to may take
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
measurements um help train volunteers on
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
some of the testing that's done because
 
00:53:14.589 --> 00:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
I know in New Hampshire Lakes um those
 
00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
associations not not New Hampshire Lakes
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
specifically but a lot of those local
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
Lake and Watershed
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
associations um perform a lot of testing
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
free through the New Hampshire lay lakes
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
program and that day feeds in to inform
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
Dees okay so I mean it will be
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
interesting to see the the information
 
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
that Dees comes back with but that's
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's very similar to the model we
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
have for supporting Lakes all right
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
let's move on here thank you so
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
um uh who's here for what let's let's
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
question okay why don't we start with
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
I don't see representative
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
Bry no have to do with me okay so I'm
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
Dan faen I am Regional policy director
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy here to talk
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
about HBS 723 FN um it is a repeal of
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
the Statewide multi-use energy data
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
platform uh repealing RSA 37850 50
 
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.710 align:start position:0%
platform uh repealing RSA 37850 50
through

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
54 um so that was those sections of law
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
were passed in 2019 and since then
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's been an effort to put together a
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide multi-use energy data platform
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
that would provide uh customers access
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
to their energy usage data and third
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
parties uh and utilities could use that
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
as well to offer a variety of services
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak about sort of the
 
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.829 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak about sort of the
different

00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
in standard util utility practice and
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
what this uh the data platform has been
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the impacts that has had on the
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
Department's resources um typically a
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
utility makes an investment brings it
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
forward to the Public Utilities
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
Commission where it's reviewed by the
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
department and many other parties um to
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the investment
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
was prudent the this bill sort of uh
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
shortcut that process and changed who
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
gets a say in the utilities uh
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
decision-making processes um and it's
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
been going on since 2019 it's involved a
 
00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
a very you know hundreds of hours for
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
the Department in in Staffing time um
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and just has been something that uh is
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
outside the normal of our standard
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
operating procedures um we prepared a
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that found a indeterminant
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
decrease in state revenues um that's
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
associated with Savings in energy costs
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state and this staff
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
time reduction that we would require if
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
the bill if the uh mandate was repealed
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer questions about
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
the platform itself or anything you well
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
the am I looking at the wrong fiscal
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
note I I see as introduced is it is
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
there um I do not believe there's an
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
amended one this bill came through um as
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
introduced okay there's no so the fiscal
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
note I'm looking says nothing there's no
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
change to revenue but there is a
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in expenditures did I miss
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
speak you said Revenue I meant
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures okay so
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
um is is this to to what extent are
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
those decreases in
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures affect the the uh general
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
fund and Highway fund and and and to
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
what extent would they be known so this
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
repeal would likely result in a savings
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
for rate payers and the uh Associated
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
lower energy costs paid for by the state
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
um however that's an extremely difficult
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
calculation to make and we're unable to
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
provide an exact figure for that gotcha
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
so so all the little Parts in the house
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
bill one that say utility costs might go
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
down a fraction is is that kind of what
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here okay
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in to try to
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
explain this to us um I was a little
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
confused by where you were going um with
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
your um a with your opening remarks I
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
mean um in terms of pro the pro the
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
process that you described
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and quite frankly trying to
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
understand you know is the Department of
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
support supportive of the multi-use
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
energy data platform or not supportive
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that a little bit yeah
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
we we are neutral this is a legislative
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
prerogative that uh was adopted in 2019
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
and if the legislature thinks it's
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
unwise we are we are an implementer so
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
we will we will stop imple implementing
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh but until that moment we we are
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
enacting the law and making sure that
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
these uh Investments are in the best
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
interest of rate payers represent mons
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
but um you you talked about hundreds of
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
hours that have theoretically or or have
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
been invested in this can you describe
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
what that is yeah so that is uh has been
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
over the the course of the period a
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer an analyst
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
um who have been pulled in from their
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
other obligations and have uh racked up
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
significant comp time uh in in this
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
process um it's been a very labor
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
intensive uh procedure um and that has
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact that this was
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
mandated as as a thing for the utilities
 
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
to do rather than the utilities deciding
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
it was a prudent investment and
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
defending that decision uh to the Pu
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
that that the the time that the lawyer's
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
been spending and the other staff has
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
that been
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
to respond to the utilities or to
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
prepare an RFP or you know what exactly
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
have they been doing yes and more um so
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
so it it's been to there there was also
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
a a couple of efforts to receive federal
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
funding for for the data platform that
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
were not successful um but there so
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
there was input uh into Federal funding
 
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:26.950 align:start position:0%
there was input uh into Federal funding
application

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
um there there's been development of an
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
RFP that should shortly be brought to
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu um things like that but it's been
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's been weekly uh for you know since
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
2019 it's been a very very intensive
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
process yes representa um you know my my
 
00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that what this platform
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
would do would be to
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
provide better more timely decision uh
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
data for decision making
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
is that an incorrect assumption there
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
are a number of potential benefits
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the a platform um there
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
there's been part of part of uh the
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
staff time has been related to figuring
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
out what exactly those are because the
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
the the Mandate doesn't um it requires I
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
forget the exact wording but um that the
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
the project be in the public interest or
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
um and I'm forgetting the exact phrase
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that it's used um but the the benefits
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
are not uh clear at this time and are
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
subject to ongoing discussion yeah and
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note it says this
 
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.630 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note it says this
would

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
cost five million or so dollars that
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
have not yet been expended right so I
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
think they decided not to go forward
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
with it is in the Science and Tech
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
committee all right represent Camal
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes having been on
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech I know this to be an
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
initiative that was really not worth the
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
what the potential cost is going to be
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of confidence in my
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues and
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
st&amp; uh and given the fact that again
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
we're in this fiscal crisis this would
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
be an excellent thing to uh to pass to
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
remove this cost to the to the rate
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
payers so oh and I'd like to make a
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
motion to OTP okay second all right so
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
move by representative Campell second by
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin to uh recommend
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
house bills 723 ought to pass and this
 
01:01:34.359 --> 01:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
house bills 723 ought to pass and this
is

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
just as opposed to making it a section
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
in house bill to so um but since there's
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
not really a direct fiscal note then it
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
probably this is appropriate yeah
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
Melissa once yes I I would say this is
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate it doesn't seem like there's
 
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
going to be any cost especially if this
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
never went into play Then There Will no
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
there will be no change or decrease okay
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
everybody know what the motion is what
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
we're voting on okay uh all those in
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
favor okay looks like six and opposed
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
three very good okay so representative
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
cell will will write a
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh a blurb or or look one up from
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
previous time this came to the house do
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
I have to for division one well this
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to recommend pass so it'll
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
go to the regular finance committee
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
presumably we'll vote
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
It Go in the
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
calendar when's When's the full
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
committee meeting do we
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
know this afternoon a lot oh
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
okays but this is probably not on the
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
list yet so so it'll be next week
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
sometime or whatever okay I have you
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%

lady who was here okay so let's do
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
one representative Sweeny
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair so just to catch
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
everybody back up so on 511 we had
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
gotten an amendment from the County
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
Association just to make the bill work
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
with the County correctional facilities
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh we reviewed the amendment I no issue
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
with adding the amendment in so I'm
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
actually happy to move Amendment
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
07858 uh I know it was handed out to us
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
a week or so ago I have it here
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
discussed it it it is a simple Amendment
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
it really just you know gives the county
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
cover for if they're holding somebody
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
under an ice
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
detainer okay so let's uh let's bring
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
the whole bill back to mind here so this
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
um represent Sweeny why don't you
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
explain the whole yeah so on on the
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
money side of this bill it was
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
indeterminable on the fiscal note uh so
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's really no real expenditures uh
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
the only note from doj when they did the
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is if the case load
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
increased significantly they may need
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing uh but there's no
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
indication that the case load would
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
increase significantly right no I meant
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
um for my benefit and the benefit of
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
Representative Stringham why don't you
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
explain the general G gist of the whole
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
bill so this is the bill that was taken
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
out of uh came out of criminal uh
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety unanimously
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's an amended version of the bill to
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
end Sanctuary City policies in New
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and they put in protections
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that nobody would be
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
unjustly uh accused of of being here
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
illegally um so this just requires
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
cooperation of local departments with
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration authorities they get
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
past the house with 98% support I think
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
they're only six or so detractors gotcha
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
and is there a related there is no
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
related section of House Bill two right
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't no put any stand
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
alone gotcha all right so um
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney uh moves
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
0785 H is there a second second seconded
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
by representative wer
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion of this
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative mutts thank you Mr chair
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
um you know I I have to admit I mean I
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
did vote for this in the house um um and
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
um but but you know a after after we we
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
discussed this um and heard the concern
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
Express I don't know who it was um who
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
brought forth the um who suggested that
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
we we make the
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um I i' I've I've had lots of
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
um setting a precedent of holding people
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
that do not have a criminal charge
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
against them in our jails I think we're
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
it we're we're we're we're going on a
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
very slippery slope and um you know this
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment it while it addresses the
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
concern that was raised it also sets a
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
precedent I believe that it and if you
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
look at the language that a detain that
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
it allows uh a county to hold a
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
detainee after the resolution of State
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
charges so in other words we're giving
 
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
the counties the ability to hold people
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
who have who have had no crime charged
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
against them and I just think that
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very dangerous
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
precedent I I can't support that we
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
already do most of the people in the
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
county jail are
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
pre-trial so they haven't been convicted
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
I I represent um thank you
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative wer I mean I think the
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
distinction is they have been charged
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
with a crime they're being held for a a
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
crime they may not have been convicted
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
but they're being held for a crime these
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
individuals will if if they have their
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
if their state charges have been
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
resolved and they're being held
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
they have not been charged with a crime
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're just being held and um again I
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
think we have to be very careful about
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
putting ourselves in a position where
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
basically anybody can be held in a
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
jail representative Sweeny and I don't
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative I don't want to get into
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
back and forth on the policy aspects of
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
this but these are only for individuals
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
with ice detainers in cooperation with
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government to so and my
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
response to I understand that it has to
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
do only with ice I understand that and I
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
guess my position would be if ice wants
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
us to hold them in a in a jail then they
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
them represent rung thank you um I
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
noticed that the representative from the
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
counties is here as I I was wondering if
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
she could comment on the amendment and
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
see if it addresses her concerns that
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
were brought up at our last meeting on
 
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.669 align:start position:0%
were brought up at our last meeting on
this

01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%

some notoriety recently because there
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
was a an arrest of four I guess illegal
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
aliens in Peterboro the town had passed
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
an ordinance some time ago that the
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
community would not work with ice and
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%

run I just want to um thank Miss Horan
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
because I I'm glad that our counties
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
can't hold them without an agreement in
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
place so we don't the counties won't be
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
holding the bag for the expense of of uh
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
doing that so thank you okay so let's
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
vote first on whether we're another
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
comment yes represent I got a call from
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
the chairman of Rockingham County a
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners saying they're they're
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
looking forward to having the same
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
agreement that I think two or three
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
other counties two other Counties have
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
because it's making money they getting
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
$160 a day and no medical cost right
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
from from the feds for for taking Isis
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever ice brings to them right and
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
and we've heard I I've heard informally
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
from uh people from Corrections that uh
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
we have extra space and conquered for
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
example and we should maybe consider
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing ourselves okay um
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
all right well in any case that's here
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
not relative to this bill but yes go
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and I do I mean
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
this did pass criminal justice I think
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
my vote today is just really going to be
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact but those concerns
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
have been addressed with the amendment
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay good so um we're just going to
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
vote on whether to adopt Amendment
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
07858 okay all those in
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
favor okay looks like seven and oppos
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
two okay very good so the amendment uh
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
passes now now uh I guess representative
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
Sweeney moves oop pass amended is second
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative wer seconds all right um
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
any further discussion no all right all
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
those in favor of opop pass with
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay we've got looks like six
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and opposed three okay very good all
 
01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.470 align:start position:0%
and opposed three okay very good all
right

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
so um at some point representative
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
Sweeney will produce a blurp
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
and possibly others will as well okay so
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
that that's 511 are Melissa are we not
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
ready for for for
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
640 I have not heard back so it's your
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
choice if you want to continue we can
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
continue why don't we at least read it
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
and see what sorry Mr chair on that last
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill I mean I'm happy to do a Minority
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
Report okay very good represent when do
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
you need that well we when it gets on
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
the calendar for the full committee
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
which it won't be for Monday right right
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah it might be next week yeah it
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
might be could be Wednesday or some
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
other day Okay uh possibly Friday next
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
sense okay well number all right so next
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 640 relative to
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
transparency of federal agency
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
operations in New Hampshire what's the
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
this one was introduced in criminal
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
justice and Public
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
Safety it came out of the committee OTP
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
9-7 and it went to the floor and was
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
passed on a Division vote 187 to
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
183 o very
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
close all
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.910 align:start position:0%
close all
right

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
um and what is it let's see here
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General a good
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
idea we've asked before how many uh
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
immigrants have been sent from the
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
border to New Hampshire and we don't get
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
a straight answer but we we've heard
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
from police departments that there are
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
some representative R thank you Mr
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
chair I think this is a real um
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
boondoggle of a bill because if you look
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
at the expenditures coming from the
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
general fund 230,000 Plus
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
in increasing through fiscal year
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
2028 and there's not even a requirement
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal agencies to provide this
 
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
data so we're going to spend all this
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
money on people and a website to put
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
this data up and it's going to give the
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
false sense to our constituents that
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
this is all the data but there could be
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
some agencies that don't provide it or
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
they're giving um obsolete data um I
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
voted against this on the floor it's
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
I just think with the tight budget we we
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
are dealing with to spend this kind of
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
money on data that's not complete or
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
reliable is really um throwing good
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
money after bad yeah well I would I
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
would say we probably should want to
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
retain this right and because of exactly
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
that right I mean we got
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh this is um if we put it into the
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
budget this would cost us46
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
$6,000 so representative
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah I agree 100% And I will
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
move to retain it okay representative
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
Griffin moves to retain House Bill 640
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
representative Wier seconds any further
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussion no all right all those in
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
favor okay looks unanimous okay very
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
good all right that completes these
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
bills um Melissa do we have other I
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
don't know House Bill two things or
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendments anything ready that we should
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
talk about yes I'm not entirely sure uh
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
we only scheduled bills in the morning
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
so we didn't put budget work session
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
continuing I did not think you guys
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
would get through those bills that fast
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
so kud to you for sort of plowing
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
through all right well why don't just to
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
I think we'd be okay with the discussion
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the paper I handed to you this
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
up so one of the ways that we can find a
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
little money in the budget is um with
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
the rooms of meals uh tax
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
distribution uh currently uh this is
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
roughly 140 million a year and um it's
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
part of the treasurer's budget um so I'm
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
propose I'm going to propose at some
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
point that we restructure it um in
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
general and it could be as RSA
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
31a right or it could be wherever
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
Melissa do we know where in in the rsas
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
this exists because I wasn't sure about
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
that sure it's currently I don't have
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
the exact RSA but it's under the M&amp;R
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
distribution so it's under the meals and
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
rooms tax uh statute okay so do we know
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
what RSA that is we'll find out but
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
anyways it it could be as a
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
reconstituted RSA 31a it could be back
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
still where it is right now um but in
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
any case uh the proposal would be
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
um as as you see it on this paper so um
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
if we
distribute

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
um 25% instead of 30% that gains for us
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the general fund something like 22
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
million a year something of that sort
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
and that gets us partway to to our goal
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
Division and then the then I'm currently
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
this money is distributed strictly by
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
population so it it works out to roughly
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
a $100 a person uh all through the the
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
state but to me I'm more sympathetic
 
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.430 align:start position:0%
state but to me I'm more sympathetic
to

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
um to places in the state that have very
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
low property values and so um so my
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
proposal would be the following three
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
points number one is we would ramp the
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
distribution by uh by the ratio of
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
property value per per person in that
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
locality right so if you look at the
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the spreadsheet and
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
and it it ranges from from roughly a low
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
of about
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh worth of property per person
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
up to $7.5 million do of property per
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
person in the in there's there's one
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
location that has two people and $15
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
million worth of property which is a it
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
turns out it's it's not a ski area it's
 
01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.590 align:start position:0%
turns out it's it's not a ski area it's
a

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.690 align:start position:0%
a
landfill

01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:09.700 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
landfill
[Laughter]

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
so it could become a who knows if they
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
have I don't know if they have a
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
mountain or whatever but that that that
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
so yes it is um so anyways so so my
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
proposal would be that um there would be
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
a ramp and there would be a starting
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
point so so so places that have high
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
property value resources would not
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
receive this money like they do now so
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
right now we write a check for
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
$200 every year to the to to those two
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
people in success right well
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
so my proposal would be that we would
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
start at 150% of average property value
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
per population which the current average
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
is roughly
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
$240,000 of property per person so we
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
would start at say 360 obviously this is
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
for discussion only right so we would
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
start at a property value per person of
 
01:21:19.719 --> 01:21:21.229 align:start position:0%
start at a property value per person of
say

01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
$360,000 and then we would ramp it up
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
toward the
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
um to toward the community that has only
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 of of property per person if
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean so um and then so
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
anybody go ahead anybody over three any
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
town with more than 360 per person would
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
get nothing that's right okay that's
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
right and um which is a you know a
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount of people but
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where that 22 million is
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean that yeah go
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
ahead ref you're only Distributing 150%
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
by this formula so the other 50% would
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
still go by population no it's not no
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's not um what what I'm talking
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
about so the amount distributed okay
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
be8 18 million say something like that
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
right but but the way it would be
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
distributed is places with greater than
 
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.430 align:start position:0%
distributed is places with greater than
roughly

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
$360,000 of property per person taxable
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
property right would get nothing and
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
people below that would get something
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
but based on a ramp based on a
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
um the the ones that yes go ahead
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yeah I'll get you
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet at some point talk about
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know the details the problem I see
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
with with uh your plan if I could call
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
it that is that towns really value you
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
know vary in in makeup and like I live
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a town that has absolutely no
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
commercial base all right and the town
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
next door to me has a huge commercial
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
base a lot of Industrial Engineer ing it
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me like you're going to have to
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
hire 10 people just to kind of come out
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
with how you how you how you treat all
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
that variation in property it's not just
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
a simple division you got to you got to
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
look at the type of properties and
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
everything else it gets very complex I
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
believe well the way the I mean this is
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
similar to the Statewide property tax
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
for example and it's just how much it's
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
treated by how much taxable property
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is in that place right so so a
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
house worth worth a million is similar
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
to a business worth a million in that in
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
that scheme now the house worth a
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
million has people in it right the
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
business worth a million has no people
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
and so that goes into the population
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
part of this formula right so anyways
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
let me go let me just get to the last
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
bullet point and then we can keep
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
talking if we want to or wait till we
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
see spreadsheets and get you know in
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
language and all that sort of stuff but
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
but the last bullet point is when you
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
look at the list
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
of uh the straightup list of population
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
versus property values okay there are
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
certain places that feel that on that
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
list look like they're very poor but but
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
my perception of those places is not
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
that they're they're quite so poor and
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
and um what the difference seems to be
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
is certain places have a lot of people
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
living in non-taxable
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
institutions okay in particular prisons
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
jails nursing homes and college
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
dorms okay so so I think it's an
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate adjustment to population for
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
for this purpose to subtract those from
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
the population and so um it it is not a
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
big number difference but it makes what
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
I perceive of the results to be more in
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
line with what I perceive to be
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
um places that have have serious
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
problems with their property tax
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
compared to others if you see what I
 
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:54.750 align:start position:0%
compared to others if you see what I
mean

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
so represent why so once you've
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
determined you're going to eliminate a
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
lot of towns the towns that the left
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
you're still going to distribute the
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
money by population yes is that correct
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes so Manchester will get a very large
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
amount of this and and uh I don't know
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
pick your favorite small
 
01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
pick your favorite small
town

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
Peter gets lesser because there is a
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
population multiplier absolutely but
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
question is for Manchester what number
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
are you multiplying by compared to some
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
other town right EP right yeah go ahead
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
the the one I've got lots of concerns
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
but one one concern that I have with the
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
the last point that we were talking
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
about you know adjusting it for
 
01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
population is um towns that have prisons
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
jails nursing homes and college dorms
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
they also have expenses that are
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
associated with those
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
entities um you know just because you
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
have a jail if you have a jail you still
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
have people that are using using the
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
toilet and putting press putting um
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
putting uh stress on your wastewater
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
treatment system and you know the rooms
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
of meals tax allocation to local towns
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
is to help with those types of expenses
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
so I mean I don't think you can say that
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know that you could you you
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
exclude those people because they don't
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
cost right right but the the biggest
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
cost that Municipal municipalities have
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
is education right and um those
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
institutions do not
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
contribute um
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
children uh in the same way that
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
standard residences do right so so they
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
tend to have again they have lower
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
property tax rates than than otherwise
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
R oh representative Stringham go ahead
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks I you know first of all this
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal deals with two things one
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
is uh uh cutting the distribution to
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
cities and towns uh from the meals and
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
room Stacks so uh no matter
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
where uh uh which which which town is
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
selected uh to not receive the money
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh shift from from
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh state government to local property
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
tax somewhere uh and and can I interject
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
just for a moment sure okay we passed
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
the bill yesterday House Bill 739 pretty
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
strongly that did exactly that but go
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
ahead that was the uh excess swept
 
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
ahead that was the uh excess swept
exactly

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes so this would be a uh uh a second
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
second Bill to uh essentially raise
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
money from the state which ultimately
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
will come from local property tax yes so
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
now now
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
um uh and that's kind of straightforward
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
and understandable I think when you get
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment you know we have 400
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and 24 Senators we're
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
probably going to have somewhere around
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
424 different positions on on uh on uh
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
the way the any changes to the
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula um you know if I
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
was in uh Berlin or gorum where good 20%
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the population is in incarcerated in
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
both the federal and and or County and
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh state prisons up there I think
 
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.430 align:start position:0%
uh state prisons up there I think
federal

01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
prison um uh you know the the issue of
 
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
whether uh of uh whether to have uh uh
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
those individuals not count would be
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm I I guess I'm saying
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
playing playing with an apportionment
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
formula um uh is is a much uh more uh
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
complicated and probably uh fairness to
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
the process ought to be um uh done in
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh a more deliberative way to allow
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
people to understand what's what's there
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh formulate what their opinions might
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
be and get input to uh avoid uh
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences uh even more so
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um I will say one weird thing about
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
the data that I've received from the LBA
 
01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
is that in the case of Berlin the the
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
list of who's in prison is zero so
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with this
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
list that was I will take full ownership
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
of that I forgot to add that one in oh
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
okay you have a revised one toiled so I
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
apologize so so yeah um anyways we'll
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
we'll end up I I'll I'll get you this I
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to hand this out so you can
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
start stewing on it right so but but
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get you the spreadsheets and the
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
before and after and all that sort of
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
stuff yes representative leean yeah
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman I yes I do have a
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
couple of questions one you have nursing
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
homes are you thinking of just County
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
nursing homes could we have nursing
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
homes for instance in Peterboro and
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
they're I don't know if they're tax
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
exemp but certainly County nursing homes
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of private nursing
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
homes that so I was just curious where
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
this non- taxable nursing homes came
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
from is that just County or it's mostly
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
County I believed what's on the list
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
Melissa do you know yeah uh we put in um
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
County and private and listed them
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
separately if you want to make the
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
distinction of whether keeping both on
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
there or removing them do we know
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
whether nursing homes that are private
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
are charged property tax or not I do not
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
know that is our County person that out
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
don't okay thank you yeah so my
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
intention would be if these are these
 
01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
are residences that that are not t part
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the taxable property base right so if
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
they are or they aren't we would put
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
them in or not put them in caring
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thought
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
further um a lot of these so-called
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
institutions whether they're colleges or
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
um jails or prisons often calling the
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
municipality for help whether it's
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
police ambulance water sewer that type
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
of thing so they do certainly have an
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
impact but I would be curious when you
 
01:32:53.639 --> 01:32:54.709 align:start position:0%
impact but I would be curious when you
get

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
CH to make comparisons the final thought
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
and we've had this discussion before is
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
putting towns against towns you know
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
because you're going to have people that
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
is representative Griffins that live in
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
say a town like Mont Vernon that some
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
are rich some are poor same with
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
Peterboro it's not a general blanket
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
that there are people that are on both
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the scale even in these richer
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
communities so I think we have to be
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
careful that we don't pit right Town
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
against town I understand but
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you representative
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli for example he's a good example
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
okay he yesterday in his speech cited
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
his town of heam right and I looked it
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
up okay and this is a town with
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
$800,000 $820,000 something like that of
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
taxable property per person okay so but
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible that that and as he
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
said there are some people in that town
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
living in Mobile Homes right and but but
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
because their town has $800 and
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
something, worth of property per person
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
their tax rate is very low let's call it
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it is but let's call
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
it $10 a th000 something like that but
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
there are people in my town who live
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
in Mobile Homes but they're because the
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
rest of our town is not in the $800,000
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
range we're in the I don't know what it
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
is $200,000 range or something they're
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
paying a property tax rate of
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
$27,000 right so I don't think it's
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to when we're giving money
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
back to towns to do it in such a way as
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
to fav those places that have low
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
property values you know I mean it it's
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's like always you always get us
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
thinking okay so yeah all right we'll
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
start with representative Griffin then
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative wer and then
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative R yeah but I I go back to
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
the the fact that you're trying to treat
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
all property the same and and so if we
 
01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
take instance of a uh a lake Lake
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
Community where you have a lot of Summer
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
people so you don't have a big year
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
round population you're taking a small
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
number into into a big
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
number all right and then you go to a
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
place like I live in mon Veron that has
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
a fairly High property value per
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
property but has a million kids and so
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
we have the highest tax rate in the
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
state because we got so many kids you
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
know and uh well but again you then you
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
would have a high population number you
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
do that formula it's not going to work
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
well well no but you would have a high
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
population at sounds like well it's not
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
simple we'll see okay not that simple
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
W we're not going to pass this budget
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
without some new thinking and some new
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
ideas and I appreciate the concept um
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
what's going to determine whether or not
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
it passes is when you get through with
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
your thing you may have to adjust this
 
01:36:16.719 --> 01:36:19.109 align:start position:0%
your thing you may have to adjust this
360,000

01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
360,000
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
um property value per person up or down
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
cuz if you end up with let's say out of
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
these towns you get 60 towns that you're
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to leave out they're all going to
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
vote against it and some others may vote
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
against it on principle or because they
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
think they're getting a buck less um so
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
you'd have to look at see where you need
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
to put that 360,000 and probably get it
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
down to no more than sure maybe 10 15%
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the towns one of the been here long
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
enough I remember um I don't see North
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
Conway in here probably it's part of
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
Conway but they always argued that they
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
weren't getting a fair Shake on meals
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
and rooms because they had people paying
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
it in their Town more than any other
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
towns and were giving money to towns who
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
have no businesses collecting meals and
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
rooms so they North con Conway was we're
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
a donor Town we're were donor town the
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
big difference was all the money comes
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
into the state so nobody knows exactly
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
how much came out of their town where we
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
did the Statewide education property tax
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
everybody knew the dollar how much money
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
was collected in that town now we're a
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
donor town so we heard that for 10 years
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
so this I like the idea having a concept
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
I like the idea we got to grab all the
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
money we can from somewhere for the
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
general fund and you know people are
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
upset about the fact that there's a a
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
statement in the uh in the hb2 that says
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
the uh dis distribution Municipal
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
distribution will be discontinued it's
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
been in there since
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
2012 this is this is a different a
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
distribution thing that we left out a
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
long time ago because we didn't have we
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
needed the money in general fund so but
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
everybody looks at that and
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
misinterprets it yeah I think we got to
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
cancel that thing all together so we
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to keep put it in there all
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
right representative rang and then I'll
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
react go ahead okay thank you I I have
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
two questions Mr chairman one is it's
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
what are your desired outcomes from this
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
I mean you're decreasing the rooms of
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
meals tax distribution but what what are
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
your your goals from this proposal yes
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
so as you know I'm I'm now a member of
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
the education funding committee and in
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
the education formula we have something
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's very very similar to this except
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the population involved is school
 
01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
children only right it's not um it's not
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
everybody but
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
I don't I think that formula is
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate and that column in that
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
formula is appropriate right because we
 
01:39:05.709 --> 01:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
do have property value per child is part
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the education funding formula and
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
places like uh Berlin
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh Charleston you know that
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
have very low property values get more
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
in our adequate education formula um
 
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.149 align:start position:0%
in our adequate education formula um
then

01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
do wolfboro Tuftonboro Newcastle
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmith those kind of places right so
 
01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't think that's un
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's inappropriate I mean I I just
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
think it I tend to think that places
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
that have a a lot of property value
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
because they are are Resorts or they
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
have lakes or they have things that
 
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
attract you know what one thing that
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
gets you high property value is is a lot
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
of second homes right and and we tax
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
they get taxes not even from New
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents right I mean Mitt
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
Romney owns a fantastic home somewhere
 
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
in Lakes Region right and so he's paying
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxes but but you know to
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
the extent that that we could tax him
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
more and New Hampshire residents
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
less I I think we've we've done
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
something good so you know that's part
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
of it okay so if I can follow up on that
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
so your goal is to lower property tax
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
the local property tax rate for
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
communities that have a higher assessed
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
value and a lower population I mean
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it's going to be on a scale
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
but no the other way around oh so lower
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes for people that higher po
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
population you know excluding these
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
things um per per property value okay um
 
01:40:56.669 --> 01:40:56.679 align:start position:0%
no I I like the out of thebox thinking
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
um but I really agree with
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin that the reason
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have a property tax issue is these
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have a lot of
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
great assessed value but a lot of kids
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
and um so it would it might if we're
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to think out of the box maybe it's
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to look at a multifaceted
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
proposal where maybe part of it is based
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
on on people per assessed value but have
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
a multiplier in there for um communities
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
which have let's say you know out of
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
that population a certain percentage or
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
School AG kids that's just one of my
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
things because you could have a
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
community um same
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
population same assessment but that one
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
community that has a lot of kids is
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
really not going to benefit as much from
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
this as a community without but I'll
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
tell you just in general the the well I
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know that this for sure
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
but but the the total number on the
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
adequate education spreadsheet is like a
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
billion right and the total number here
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
is 10 and something million right so
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's the scale of the two things
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
are quite different right anyways
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you um you know I just
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
want to Echo what what representative
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
Stringham said that you know I think
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
first and foremost we have to recognize
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
that if if this proposal were to go
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
forward we are going to be placing um
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
about $22 million of extra cost on local
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers because um you know
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
those expenses are not going to go away
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
so the local property taxpayers are
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to absorb that in in
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
addition of the concern I expressed
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about excluding you know prisons
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
jails and nursing homes I mean the other
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
thing that um and you know that I have
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
to bring up is you know since we're
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the rooms and meals tax
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's an inherent inequity in the in
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
the program right now and and
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wier U touched on it with
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
North Conway there are towns there are
 
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
towns and areas in the state that
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
generate significant amount a
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of the rooms and
 
01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
significant amount of the rooms and
meals

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
meals
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
tax who also as a result of that incur
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
significant additional expenses I mean I
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
can tell you in Hampton um we go from a
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
town of um
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
you know 13 14,000 in the in the winter
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
there are days in the summer when we
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
have a population of 100,000 and we have
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
to have additional police we have to
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
have additional fire and um we bring a
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
lot of extra Revenue to the state as a
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
result of that but we don't get nearly
 
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
compensated for the extra cost that we
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
incur um so I mean if we're going to
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
start playing around with the rooms and
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
meals formula you know I'd like to see
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
us do something about adjusting those
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
those kind of inequities um because it's
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a real cost to our our local
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers well I'll push back
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
just slightly I mean you have a good
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
point but but um you do have in such a
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
place uh businesses tourist businesses
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
right and those things pay property tax
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
right and so some other
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
place might have you're right you have
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
very few people right but you do have
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
property values that reflect the values
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
of those businesses so anyways
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative string yeah be being that
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
Lincoln is the biggest part of my
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
district okay and um and and yeah there
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
are some very expensive homes you know
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
some of the businesses are uh people's
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
second bed bedroom that they uh rent
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
rent out to skiers via
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and they do collect uh uh meals
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
and room tax if they uh rent out less in
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
six months and they're they're pretty
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
good uh the state's pretty good at
 
01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
enforcing uh finding those people and
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
make sure they understand what the rules
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
are and pay up they de deal very well
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
but uh and um and but but there are
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
people you know
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
making you know quasi you know working
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
wages minimum close to minimum wage
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
anyway and um uh and uh they they pay
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
property tax and there that Town's that
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
is already being affected if assuming uh
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that was passed yesterday
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
goes through because Linkin uh by the
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
old definition would would certainly be
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
a donor Town
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and um so you
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
know I I don't know whether we want to
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
reinforce and and uh you know TR try to
 
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
hit the same towns twice with two
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
different bills yeah I understand
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
representative uh wer then MS
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
strategy is this if we took 20 million
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
away from 140 million and then we showed
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet every time would get less
 
01:46:04.589 --> 01:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
every rep would vote against it if we
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
rejig the formula so that some in fact
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
get more then those would all vote for
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
it that you have to arrange your
 
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
formulas such that there are more that
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
get a there more getting more than less
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
getting less redistributing 120 million
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
that's left under a different formula
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
and if it redistributes where let's say
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
the majority of towns get a buck more oh
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
it'll all V for it right and and the way
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
to move that is that 150% number right
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
you could slide that to 200% or
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
something and that would have more of
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the effect that you're talking about
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
represent mths so just one last last
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
point in my um in my exuberance about
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
the um talking about the inequities of
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
the current system yes I neglected to
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
just mention you know an example that I
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight of what I was
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
talking about if you look at this sheet
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
Hampton um currently is getting $16
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
million in rooms and meals allocation
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's on page two and then you look at
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
Milford and um I just you know no
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
offense to anybody in Milford um
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
milford's getting 1.6 million as well
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
okay I would I would I would submit that
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
Hampton is bringing in significantly
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
more in rooms and meals tax in than
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
Milford and also incurring significantly
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
more expense associated with that mhm so
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's just an example of the inequities
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay and and and we'll we'll look at the
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
before and after for those two places
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
and see what happens yes representative
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
leash representative Griffin and I are
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with Milford as I grew up
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
there but milford's got a huge
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
commercial base that pays huge money
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
into the uh business profits and
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax we have or now I
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
live in Peter brose you know but Milford
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
has a huge uh industrial base and I've
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
heard for years that milford's
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
contributing all this money to the state
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
like other cities and they're not
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
getting what they should get back
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
because milford's the Hub you've got
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mont Veron with no commercial activity
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
up there Brook line around it so
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
milford's H like Peterboro is a hub
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
where they have restaurants and other
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
businesses and again I think I commend
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
you for what you're suggesting because
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
it gets us thinking but the Department
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration this is
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
something I've asked the commissioner
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
many times why don't they keep track of
 
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:32.679 align:start position:0%
what comes out of each Community from
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise business profits and
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals because we have no idea
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
how these uh break down as far as a
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
contribution to the state conference but
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm looking forward to your spread
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
right well I I'll let the representative
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
rang have the last word here okay think
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
oh that's
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
special um I think in your analysis Mr
 
01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.430 align:start position:0%
special um I think in your analysis Mr
chair

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
it may be easier if we excluded your
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
last bullet as far as the prison jail
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes college dorms I agree with
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative leean about I I don't
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
know how you would really get an
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
accurate number on that and a lot of the
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
populations in those institutions change
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
so frequently and how how do you how can
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
we be assured of accurate numbers when
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
that calculation is is going on and the
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
other thing I want to mention two
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
following what representative Lehman
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
said about um commercial industrial
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
versus uh residential I mean maram we've
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
got a nice balanced tax base with
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial we have Fidelity
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
we have anheiser Bush my favorite um and
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
but the the problem is is what we've
 
01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:45.639 align:start position:0%
seen at least in my town is our
 
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
residential property assessments have
 
01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
residential property assessments have
been

01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing and at a much higher rate
 
01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.679 align:start position:0%
than commercial industrial so even
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
without any in extra spending on
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
municipal or town our taxes have gone up
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
because of that ratio has changed so
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
residentials taking a bigger piece of
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
the pie so I'm not really sure if the
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
element of that um would come into play
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
with this right so the Dr creates um an
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
and um what is it called equalized
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
property value uh because certain places
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
you reassess this year and other places
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
next year and so on so they they adjust
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
all of the property values in the state
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
to come up with an equalized value for
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
every location so theoretically those
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
things are are equal evened out but but
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
what you just described namely uh the
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
value of residential property has grown
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
faster than the value of commercial
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
property that's just a matter that the
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
market has gone that way right and and
 
01:50:57.870 --> 01:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
so it does shift um property tax more
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
onto residences and less onto businesses
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
but that's simply because you
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
know we try to tax the Constitution
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
requires us to tax things
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
uniformly right and if it happens that
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
residences are worth more than
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
businesses that just happens you know so
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
and just because I do want the last word
 
01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:21.719 align:start position:0%
um you know and and that's sort of an
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
outfall of the housing crisis that we
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
really haven't um we it it really hasn't
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
been a major point of discussion but if
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
communities around miramac grew their
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
housing we would have probably lower
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh home property taxes
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
because there's not that demand for
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
housing so it it's not necessary that
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
marac has to build more housing even
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
though we have built a lot of housing
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
but other communities by by addressing
 
01:51:57.709 --> 01:51:57.719 align:start position:0%
the housing uh crisis regionally by
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
state it will lower property taxes for
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
all because then the demand will go down
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
um the values will go down and then it
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
will shift more of that piece of the
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
assessment pie on to commercial
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
industrial sure okay we will come back
 
01:52:13.719 --> 01:52:14.790 align:start position:0%
industrial sure okay we will come back
at

01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
1:15 um should Republicans have a lunch
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
maybe I treated by me oh you you want to
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
do that yeah okay you can have it
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
delivered where is it going to be that
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
we can have a caucus and I was thinking
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
that I brought my lunch but to insist
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
can I
 
01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.990 align:start position:0%
can I
CH

01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
CH
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
yes only if it's
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
permanent we have to revisit Sanctuary
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
cities Chris if we're gonna do
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%

03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
are caught up in the group t uh group
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
two tier B that we're discussing today
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
um not going to try and take up a ton
 
03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
ton of your time but first and foremost
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you to this committee uh in this
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
division for all of the work that you're
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
you're putting in not only with this one
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
singular issue but just across the board
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
with with a budget I'm not going to
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
pretend to understand what it takes to
 
03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
that goes into that uh to get a balance
 
03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
budget out of the house so um I really
 
03:18:51.150 --> 03:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time to listen
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
to all of us um and I recognize that
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
we've done this song and dance before so
 
03:18:58.590 --> 03:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
um certainly I'll try and keep it brief
 
03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
but we do have some new members yes
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's fair that's fair um so first and
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
foremost I I we don't need to I think
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
rehash the issues of of 2011
 
03:19:10.750 --> 03:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I believe you
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
you've done a pretty good job of that
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
already um but I do think there was a
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
has been a couple of things discussed
 
03:19:18.790 --> 03:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to address uh any
 
03:19:21.710 --> 03:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns over um and that's
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
the intent here today um first and
 
03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
foremost it was uh mentioned that
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
there's been two major changes uh that
 
03:19:30.750 --> 03:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
were made in 2011 to the pension system
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
for group two tib um in fact there's
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
been dozens of changes that were made um
 
03:19:40.110 --> 03:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
that significantly altered benefits to
 
03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
the range of 20 to $30,000 depending on
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
um how how how many hours you work and
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
um you know how many years you put into
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
the system uh obviously each individual
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
case is different uh but what we've
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
determined is that that equates to uh
 
03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars uh for members that
 
03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
had benefits cut uh after working in
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
some cases 9 years and 11 months those
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
benefits were cut um so I just think
 
03:20:12.189 --> 03:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to know uh the group that
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of doesn't have a lot of
 
03:20:17.830 --> 03:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
angst over uh one or two minor changes
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
it has been a whole Myriad of things
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
that have cut their benefits um the
 
03:20:23.710 --> 03:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
other thing that I think is important to
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
note because I recognized there was a
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion the other day about uh
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
the Goodwill in trying to fix some of
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
these issues for tier b i acknowledged
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
that uh that is 1,00% true uh both the
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and the governor uh
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
tried to do some things to incrementally
 
03:20:42.309 --> 03:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
restore some of these benefits uh we
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't gotten to where the
 
03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is and that's a full
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
restoration of these benefits uh but we
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
have made some incremental changes
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
what's important to note is members
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
across Public Safety in tier a and tier
 
03:21:01.950 --> 03:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
C both still currently have the benefits
 
03:21:03.630 --> 03:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
they were promised upon
 
03:21:06.189 --> 03:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
higher all members in tier a and all
 
03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
members in tier C are going to
 
03:21:10.269 --> 03:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
effectively retire with the benefits
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
they were promised it is the tier B
 
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
group that has since changed from the
 
03:21:17.950 --> 03:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
date their date of hire um so while I I
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
recognize and I agree with the fact that
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
I think down the line we're going to
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
have to look towards uh
 
03:21:29.309 --> 03:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
some modifications to tierc to make the
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
retirement more uh palatable
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
and um reasonable for people to come
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire they were hired
 
03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
under the
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
terms uh that that they're going to
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
retire with uh when they're eligible the
 
03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
other piece to note is they are not
 
03:21:48.910 --> 03:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for retirement until the year
 
03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:50.550 align:start position:0%
eligible for retirement until the year
2036

03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
2036
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
2037 so if there is going to be I'll use
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
the term that's been thrown around
 
03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
enhancements to their
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
benefit um there is plenty of time to
 
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
look at that uh to look at how we make
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
our retirement system better the tier B
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
group is now be becoming eligible for
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
retirement and what we're seeing is that
 
03:22:15.070 --> 03:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
those that are becoming eligible for
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
retirement are leaving
 
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
which is different than the way it used
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
to be where each additional year of
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
service Beyond Your Service
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility is worth sticking around for
 
03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
because it makes your benefit better
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
each year that you work um what we're
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we're trying to stop the
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage and we're trying to fix this
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
trb group to keep them here in
 
03:22:42.670 --> 03:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
service beyond their years that they're
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
required to be here which I think is
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
incredibly important especially
 
03:22:49.389 --> 03:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
where we talk about and this is true in
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
the private or public sector and I'm
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
sure most of you would agree with this
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
the best form of advertisement for
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
any uh industry is the people that work
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
there and that can advocate for it we
 
03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
truly believe and this I can only speak
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
from the firehouse side but the
 
03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
firehouse kitchen table is where we get
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
everything done and that's why this has
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
become no longer an anecdotal problem
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
because we around the firehouse table
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
every single day and we talk about this
 
03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
problem um and it's perpetuated by
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
people that feel as though they were
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
they were injured back in 2011 and
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're frustrated and they're
 
03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the system and I truly
 
03:23:35.790 --> 03:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
believe that if the state makes good on
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
the promise um that these employees had
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
when they were hired that that is going
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be the best form of advertisement to
 
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
change that narrative at that Firehouse
 
03:23:45.309 --> 03:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
kitchen table and it's going to
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
encourage t C people to stick around
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
because TC people are now going to know
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
the state has their back too and I think
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
that that's that's important I know the
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
differentiation between be T tier B and
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
tier C has been kind of under dispute I
 
03:24:01.150 --> 03:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
that um let me ask you you said 550
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
members are in tier B is that roughly 50
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
to 60 per year or is the the longer
 
03:24:13.150 --> 03:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
serving members are they starting to
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
retire and
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
therefore it's it's it's sort of front
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
loaded or something at the at the
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
slightly I don't know the answer to that
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going off of uh numbers that we had
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
last year during the retirement
 
03:24:26.590 --> 03:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
commission when they had that breakdown
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system may have some
 
03:24:32.429 --> 03:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
idea but I don't know what range that is
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I do know we have had a significant
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
number that have left prior to their
 
03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility um because at the time when
 
03:24:43.229 --> 03:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
these changes were made and I'll speak
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
for me personally uh I didn't really
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
understand man the impact of it until
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
you as you get older in your career you
 
03:24:53.110 --> 03:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
start actually putting pen to paper and
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
doing some numbers and realizing okay
 
03:24:57.710 --> 03:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is a problem and now you
 
03:25:00.429 --> 03:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
work with someone who knows finances and
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
they and and trying to determine if it's
 
03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to leave now leave my money
 
03:25:06.910 --> 03:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the system and go work in the Private
 
03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
Industry or to stick around and I think
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
people are weighing that difference okay
 
03:25:15.150 --> 03:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I I had one
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
other sorry I had one other yeah sorry
 
03:25:19.469 --> 03:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
um one of the the things that has been
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
brought up not just in this division but
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
across the board is the term spiking and
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
I recognize The Angst that there is with
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
that term um first I know the New
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system does not
 
03:25:35.710 --> 03:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that term it is not defined in
 
03:25:40.349 --> 03:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
RSA 100a it's more of um I think kind of
 
03:25:42.750 --> 03:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
a a a conversational piece than anything
 
03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
else I understand why there is
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
is difficulty accepting someone who gets
 
03:25:53.469 --> 03:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
paid out at a higher pension I I
 
03:25:55.269 --> 03:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
completely understand that what I would
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
like to draw attention to is
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
a the way that we fund our retirement
 
03:26:05.790 --> 03:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
system and our rates is a percentage of
 
03:26:09.550 --> 03:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
payroll so I personally pay 11.8%
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
towards my retirement that is whether I
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
make $50,000 a year or if I make
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
$150,000 a year
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
that money goes into the retirement
 
03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
system and the retirement system invests
 
03:26:23.469 --> 03:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
that money and that
 
03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that the Investments are one of the
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
ways one of the the biggest ways that
 
03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
they pay out benefits at the end of my
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
career um so whether again whether I
 
03:26:35.550 --> 03:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
make 50,000 or 150,000 it is a
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of that payroll um so I am
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
still paying into the system that amount
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
the employers are still paying into the
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
system that percent their percentage
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
which is somewhere around 30% now
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's not damaging to the system in
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
a sense that we are still paying money
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
into the system okay the other piece to
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
that is whether I work it in my last say
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
three years or five years of service or
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
somebody works it in their first three
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
or five years of service money is being
 
03:27:09.070 --> 03:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
paid into the system okay cities and
 
03:27:12.030 --> 03:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
towns have a minimum Staffing standard
 
03:27:13.349 --> 03:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
that they
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
meet these are hours worked if if
 
03:27:19.950 --> 03:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
someone is out sick and I and I am there
 
03:27:21.790 --> 03:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
left to cover the shift whether I elect
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
to cover it or I'm forced to cover it
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
under mandatory Provisions I'm working
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
those hours these are not in uh
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
artificially inflated numbers these are
 
03:27:34.590 --> 03:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
hours worked so members that have a
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
higher pension it's because they
 
03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
physically showed up and worked 70 80
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
hour weeks okay so it's not again it's
 
03:27:45.309 --> 03:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
they're not just artificially inflated
 
03:27:45.319 --> 03:27:47.670 align:start position:0%
they're not just artificially inflated
numbers

03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and the last piece of this is there
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
are regardless of where we go this year
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
there are and will continue to remain
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place for quote unquote
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
spiking um they are in law now we're not
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
asking to change them it's different for
 
03:28:11.349 --> 03:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
for different people based on the year
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that you were hired but those caps
 
03:28:15.830 --> 03:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
still remain in place and we're not
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
asking asking to change those okay
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
represent Ms thank you U Mr chair and
 
03:28:23.710 --> 03:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in on this
 
03:28:27.550 --> 03:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
beautiful Friday um with regard to the
 
03:28:29.950 --> 03:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
the overtime and the on the in the on
 
03:28:33.910 --> 03:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
call pay um isn't isn't it true that
 
03:28:36.630 --> 03:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
some of that or maybe a large part of
 
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
that is due to the fact that we have
 
03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:40.750 align:start position:0%
that is due to the fact that we have
chronic

03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
03:28:43.710 --> 03:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
understaffing um across the Departments
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
and so we've got like a it's it's it's
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
almost like a a cycle we don't have
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
enough people so we have more overtime
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe more people leave um isn't that
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
part of the issue yeah thank you for the
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
question representative absolutely um
 
03:28:59.910 --> 03:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
what we're finding
 
03:29:05.950 --> 03:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
is uh the incentive to want to work the
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
overtime is not there so we're having
 
03:29:11.469 --> 03:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty filling these shifts and
 
03:29:14.030 --> 03:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
again cities and towns have M mandatory
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
minimum Staffing standards that they
 
03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
must meet
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
so if we go through an overtime list and
 
03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
reach out to everyone to say hey would
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
you like to work the overtime no would
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
you like to work the overtime no
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
everyone gets offered an equal
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work those shifts if they
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
choose not to others are being forced
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
into those positions so um it is it's
 
03:29:41.389 --> 03:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
hard when just the regular day-to-day
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
when someone takes a day off let alone
 
03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
if we are underst staffed because we
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
can't recruit or retain Personnel now we
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
have five six seven vacancies so we're
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
holding someone every day we're forcing
 
03:29:55.790 --> 03:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
them to stay but on the back end we're
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
advocating that they their pension
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
should not reflect that followup yes go
 
03:30:03.070 --> 03:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah and and to that point I mean
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and one of I'm one of the reasons we
 
03:30:06.840 --> 03:30:08.189 align:start position:0%
um and one of I'm one of the reasons we
have

03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
vacancies is because of this uh concern
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
that people have about their benefits
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
and their overall pay package correct
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
correct yeah knowing that you can go
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
work in a um in an industry where you're
 
03:30:25.870 --> 03:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
promised certain benefits and those
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
benefits can be taken away uh up to 9
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
years 11 months 29 days um it's really
 
03:30:34.349 --> 03:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
disconcerting for people to want to come
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
in and and work in the
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
state all right representative uh wrong
 
03:30:42.189 --> 03:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
followed by lean okay thank you Mr chair
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you um we heard public
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
testimony Wednesday today um and a
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
specific testimony that in intrigued me
 
03:30:52.269 --> 03:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
regarding this issue was from Sergeant
 
03:30:54.269 --> 03:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
selli I believe that's his name from the
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
na oh from the National Police
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
Department thank you very much for
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
sending that written testimony along but
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
one of the um issues that this presents
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
is around retention which you've touched
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
upon and the fact and I think in
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Chelli in your testimony you
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned how changes in the benefit
 
03:31:14.189 --> 03:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
structure of Massachusetts has
 
03:31:16.750 --> 03:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
incentivized officers leaving New
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go work in
 
03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and um do you have any
 
03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
more information on that let's say for
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
other states or if it applies also
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
equally to
 
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
Firefighters I'm sure um so what I can
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
provide you that's not just Word of
 
03:31:37.950 --> 03:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
Mouth answer is that the New Hampshire
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
fire academy runs a test and it's the
 
03:31:43.389 --> 03:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
candidate Physical Agility Test it's a
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
test you're it's an entry-level exam
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
that you're required to take to be a
 
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the state of New
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh prior to 2011 there were uh
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
approximately 500 to 600 candidates that
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
would take that test a every year we're
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
down to about 200 per year now and if
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the chart that they've
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
provided uh it has been a s uh
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
significant downtrend since 2011 you can
 
03:32:11.830 --> 03:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
see the delineation where it has slowly
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
trickled down since that date um and the
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
state has
 
03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
since the the department of safety has
 
03:32:21.150 --> 03:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
since done a recruitment and retention
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh study in which they specifically
 
03:32:26.910 --> 03:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted these changes to the group
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
two uh tier B system as a uh as one of
 
03:32:36.990 --> 03:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
the many albeit fixes to uh Recruitment
 
03:32:39.030 --> 03:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
and Retention in the state um if you
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the other PD side so I
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
have a unique perspective because I
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
spent 13 years in Massachusetts uh law
 
03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement before I came up to New
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I can tell you in those 13
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
years I never saw one New Hampshire
 
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
police officer certified officer come to
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to work uh in the last
 
03:33:02.429 --> 03:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
since 2011 the statistics I pulled from
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
um our recruiting division we've had 27
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
now leave New Hampshire and go south or
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
to federal agencies uh and we never saw
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
that before uh 2011 and like I said I
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
was in Massachusetts law enforcement
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
from 94 to 07 and we didn't see anybody
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
coming to Massachusetts from other
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
states to to work there in massachusett
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
has recently uh reduced their residency
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
requirement Civil Service requirement so
 
03:33:33.550 --> 03:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
half your Police Department can just be
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
an application to get hired there so
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
that's the spike and we're seeing people
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
going down south uh because the the
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits uh are currently
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
greater there than they are here and
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's a primary reason we do exit
 
03:33:49.309 --> 03:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
interviews with every uh employee that
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
leaves and that's the primary reason why
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
they say they're leaving to go to law
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh from our law enforcement
 
03:33:59.070 --> 03:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
to another uh municipality uh job in
 
03:34:02.110 --> 03:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
another state let me let me ask you
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
before representative leechman you said
 
03:34:08.070 --> 03:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
27 moved to Massachusetts over what
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
period of time uh since 2011 but we've
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
had 70 leave prior to uh um retirement
 
03:34:21.189 --> 03:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
age but those 27 which albeit seems
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
minuscule because it comes out to about
 
03:34:26.910 --> 03:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
two a year that's 27 more than we had
 
03:34:30.110 --> 03:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
pre 2010 sure but how
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
many how many are in each Year's total
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
number of officers is it unfortunately I
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that number but I will say CU
 
03:34:41.950 --> 03:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
he had 550 so we we're seeing we're
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more each year because
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
those those uh Ease on restrictions have
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh come in the last uh couple of years
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it's we're seeing more in the last 5
 
03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
years than we have prior to that so back
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I think it might have been one
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh we had a couple years with zero but
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh I know this year alone 20 24 this
 
03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
past year I want to say we had six so
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's increasing but I'm under
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
the impression there's more police
 
03:35:12.990 --> 03:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
officers than there are firefighters is
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
that right in the in this group I I do
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
believe so yes yeah but I don't have the
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
exact I know 1821 when we started all
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman so I do have
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
03:35:28.590 --> 03:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions um as you know the retirement
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
commission that met suggested a number
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
of changes which were some adopted in
 
03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
1647 which the Senate took up about half
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
of that uh and looking through house
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill to this year and I want to make
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
sure I'm correct in this assumption it's
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
just taking care of the group to that
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
tiered if you will tier B and there's
 
03:35:53.189 --> 03:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
nothing for tier C because one of the
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
things we put in 1647 that myself and
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire uh sponsored was
 
03:36:03.189 --> 03:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
also to take care of tier C and I guess
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is because there's nothing
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
for tier C the issue of retention comes
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
up because they're not getting the same
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
level of benefit of those people that
 
03:36:14.830 --> 03:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
were vested before 2011 and of course
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
that group that you're in so how does
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
that stand how are we going to take care
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the t uh tier C's when those people
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the same benefits that you
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
have and the people be
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
behind thank you for the question uh yes
 
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
so as you'll recall with the commission
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh the commission was born out of uh
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 which was originally a
 
03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill much like the one we're looking at
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
today uh to restore all the benefits for
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
tier B that was how this all started
 
03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
this division uh voted in favor of those
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh Full House Finance voted
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
in favor of those provisions and that's
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
what passed the house floor 282 to 80 um
 
03:37:02.349 --> 03:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
we're essentially what we're talking
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
about today a full restoration for tier
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
B what had happened when the Senate
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
stripped it out was it was replaced with
 
03:37:11.550 --> 03:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
the commission uh which you and I both
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
served on that commission um it it was
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
already determined at that point that
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
the provisions of House Bill 436 were
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
not palatable by the Senate and so
 
03:37:26.910 --> 03:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
whatever we were going to get done was
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
going to be far less than that uh and so
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
we worked through it as a commission uh
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
obviously uh the group that wanted to uh
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
pass the the the bigger changes was in
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
the minority at that point in the room
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
did not it was not palatable uh to the
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
rest of the group and so we landed on uh
 
03:37:52.229 --> 03:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
Provisions for 1647 which would impact
 
03:37:54.750 --> 03:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
tier B and tier c um it was what we were
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
able to get done at the time it was we
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
knew the best that we were going to be
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
able to do but it also was a positive
 
03:38:04.389 --> 03:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
incremental change and it was helpful to
 
03:38:06.429 --> 03:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
start to to do that so that we could
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
have the conversation we have today
 
03:38:09.790 --> 03:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
right because the changes that we want
 
03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
to make now become cheaper because we
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
have made the the changes of the past
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
now as for your question for tier C I
 
03:38:22.590 --> 03:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you uh everyone in this group
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
that represents a uh Public Safety
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
organization also represents members in
 
03:38:31.630 --> 03:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
tier c um I have to go back and answer
 
03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
to those folks as well um what I can
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
tell you is they fully understand
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
probably not 100% across the board but
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
largely they understand the importance
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
of fixing this tier B issue
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
before we address the tier C stuff
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
because tier B we looking to restore
 
03:38:59.070 --> 03:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
what was taken away tier C is in fact
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
anything we give them an added benefit a
 
03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:02.790 align:start position:0%
anything we give them an added benefit a
new

03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
benefit the tier B changes The Tib
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
restoration is not a new benefit it is
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
restoring their old benefit and so they
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of fixing this
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
disparity first so that in 5 10 years
 
03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
down the road we can have the
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether or not we
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
need to enhance or make that benefit
 
03:39:27.070 --> 03:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
better it that conversation will
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
probably happen sooner than five years
 
03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
down the road let's be honest um in
 
03:39:34.630 --> 03:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
order to uh continue to retain but again
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
we have time it's 2036 2037 before they
 
03:39:40.750 --> 03:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
can retire now
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
Additionally the the bill as written
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
does have a provision in there for or
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
for vesting or did have a provision in
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
there for vesting um which would say
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
that you could not lower someone's
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
benefit after three years of service
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
that would in fact be a significant
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
change for tier C because then they in
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
my opinion can rest their head on the
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
pillow at night knowing that this will
 
03:40:08.910 --> 03:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
never happen again and we'll never have
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
to come back and address benefits that
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
were taken
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
away um anyone you're all set okay um
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
now you described this what what we have
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 as full restoration for
 
03:40:26.910 --> 03:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
tier B but but my understanding is that
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
would mean making them the same as tier
 
03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
would mean making them the same as tier
a

03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
right essentially yes I I I think we're
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
very very close to tier a there are some
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
some differences there um so we wouldn't
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
because I don't read the bill as making
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know a tier a b and a tier C if you
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
see what I mean
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
right there's still an ABC in here okay
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
um somebody can speak to that question
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
okay great okay thank you other
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no all
 
03:41:03.189 --> 03:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
right let's go you want to say something
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
if I may uh just those stats and the
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
numbers of the 27 that I was throwing
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
out that's simply for nasua that's not
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay I just want yeah two two for the
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
state would be great but
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh yeah no that's that's just NASA by
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
sure and and maybe people from NASA it's
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
more it's easier for them to move to
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
mass start working in
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts than it would be somebody
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
from Lincoln or whatever right so yeah
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
potentially yeah yeah okay very good or
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester yeah all right thank you

good

03:41:48.189 --> 03:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh my name is sa regasa I am
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
the President of the New Hampshire group
 
03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
to retirement
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh this is a coalition which
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
represent the 1,800 employees now that
 
03:42:02.349 --> 03:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
number had dropped
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
to 1,600 employees uh as of July
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
2023 so
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I would start by addressing couple
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
things uh I know represent ative uh
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
months have asked about this
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
overtime my agency is Department of
 
03:42:26.990 --> 03:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections and currently we are at 45
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
plus per
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
vacancy as you all know there was an
 
03:42:34.590 --> 03:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
initiative from the state that offer
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
$10,000 hiring incentive for those who
 
03:42:40.590 --> 03:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
comes in to work for the state and that
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
incentive has stopped with that uh
 
03:42:49.469 --> 03:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
10,000 bonus we weren't able to move the
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
needle and we're around right now at 45
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
plus percentage I don't want to speak
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
the exact number but I know it is 45
 
03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:58.070 align:start position:0%
the exact number but I know it is 45
plus

03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
plus
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
percentage under any circumstances if it
 
03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
was a private business that business is
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
under the
 
03:43:04.359 --> 03:43:06.269 align:start position:0%
under the
water

03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
so the overtime at the Department of
 
03:43:12.189 --> 03:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
Correction is the major reason that most
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
people get tired and most people are
 
03:43:16.510 --> 03:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
afraid to come and work for the state of
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
Corrections people get to work four five
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
forced overtime now I am the part of the
 
03:43:27.070 --> 03:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction my job I'm a
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
chief probation par officer when the
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
prison is under staff when they have
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
National Guard or after the National
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
Guard left we will be required to go
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
assist and I ran I very rarely would
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
work less than three over times a
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
week but the regular people
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
would have to work there and the way how
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
overtime work is it's a forced overtime
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
they can't refuse because if they refuse
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
there will be discipline for refusing a
 
03:43:59.070 --> 03:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
forced overtime so you are an individual
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
and mostly young person and they come in
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
to work for Department one overtime no
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
problem good money I'll go home with
 
03:44:07.630 --> 03:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
more money two overtime no problem by
 
03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
the third day now you are cutting your
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
tie with your family members with your
 
03:44:13.950 --> 03:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders with everyone
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
so we force people to work this overtime
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and now in addition to that as Brian
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
explained in addition to that we also
 
03:44:30.149 --> 03:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
charge them to
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
pay additional money the more money you
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
make the more contribution you pay for
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
TOS to the new hire retirement not only
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
the individual but also as the state so
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
as far as spiking I understand the
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
concern as a taxpayer I wouldn't want no
 
03:44:46.189 --> 03:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
spiking people who never put their money
 
03:44:48.429 --> 03:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
to take money from the state but the
 
03:44:51.309 --> 03:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
reality is this is actually people pay
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
way more money to the retire in system
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
when they work more hours retention
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
issue representative
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
Rec right now what sustain my agency
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction is retention if
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
we were to pull or if we were to annoy
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
the current members including myself
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
that I have now my 23rd years was
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
Saturday last Saturday we're still
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
kicking around we still helping our
 
03:45:18.910 --> 03:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters and I don't think
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
anyone is capable of leaving them while
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
they are under 45% vacancy
 
03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
rate but if we were to take out the
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
people that are currently there and
 
03:45:32.229 --> 03:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire in the next five or
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
six years we are going to call National
 
03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
Guard for the fourth time to the prison
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
ground and the last I check the good
 
03:45:41.790 --> 03:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
Governor have refused to even send them
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
for the first time because he did it
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
three times and that's not really when
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
you send the National Guard at the
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
prison things don't run the way how they
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
are supposed to run that's not the
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
preferred method of watching
 
03:45:55.630 --> 03:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility by a trained
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
military personnel they have other use
 
03:46:00.189 --> 03:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
they have other obligations to do it's
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
just a wrong practice in my
 
03:46:05.229 --> 03:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
opinion but in addition to that years
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
ago we used to be able to teach I teach
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
at Southern New Hampshire University I
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
lecture classes in criminal justice
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
department we'll have 25 student every
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
year and we'll be able ble to snag five
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
six of them to come to work for the
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
state and this year I have 25 students
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
and none of them wants to come and be a
 
03:46:27.070 --> 03:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer in state of New
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we are in a position where
 
03:46:32.590 --> 03:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
we're not recruiting we're going to lose
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
the people who are sustaining who can
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
leave uh the average of people that I
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
talk to have at least five more years to
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
work I think we need these people who
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
would retire in the next 5 years way
 
03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
would retire in the next 5 years way
more

03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
the people who were not even eligible to
 
03:46:50.189 --> 03:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
retire until 2036 is the retirement
 
03:46:53.189 --> 03:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
system is broken before 2012 there was
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
an issue and that's why those preventive
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
measures were put in place but as one of
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
the masterminded of that change
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledged with 436 that went too far
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances any of you in
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
here if you tell me that you'll be
 
03:47:12.510 --> 03:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly okay after I promise you I
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
signed an agreement and I gave you a job
 
03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
off and 9 years later to come back and
 
03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
say h whatever I told you was you know
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
false and now I'm going to change it
 
03:47:23.469 --> 03:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
nobody would be no human being will be
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
happy with what was done in 2012 but
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
let's take it one step further what good
 
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
comes out of it really we lost
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money we lost
 
03:47:36.630 --> 03:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
paying overtime we lost significant
 
03:47:39.030 --> 03:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
amount of trained Personnel the state of
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire become a recruitment Depot
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
to the surrounding State and I say that
 
03:47:47.110 --> 03:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
because we hire people we train them
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
only when they have one year and two
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
years to say you know what I'm going to
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
go over the board and I'm going to work
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
20 years and retired with the highest
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
retirement in massachusett Maine
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont so there was no win-win solution
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
for it and I can understand it wi it was
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
able we were able to stop what was
 
03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
intended but I think it had gone too far
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
it has gone too far we're not retaining
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
the people and I and understand this is
 
03:48:19.229 --> 03:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
a priority to the good
 
03:48:22.030 --> 03:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
Governor I say that because this is a
 
03:48:23.070 --> 03:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
difficult time for a state of New
 
03:48:25.149 --> 03:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aside from my job I represent
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
my Workforce and I negotiate contract we
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't expect much change this year as a
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
state employee because the state is in a
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
difficult place the state is even in a
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
more difficult place when we could lose
 
03:48:39.830 --> 03:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
people who are capable to retire who are
 
03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
able to retire because we continue to
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
reject this idea of honoring
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
what was they were
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
promised as Brian indicated previously
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
when you change the condition of
 
03:48:54.750 --> 03:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
employment to tier a employee it will be
 
03:48:57.149 --> 03:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
pension sweetening or adjustment the
 
03:48:58.750 --> 03:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
benefit they didn't have the same thing
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the C it's pension
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
sweetening but when you give to the
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
people that were affected under the
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
certain condition that was taken
 
03:49:10.030 --> 03:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
unfairly and we know it was unfair
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
because I can ask any of you if it was
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
fair if if it was done to you you tell
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
me it wasn't so if it was done unfairly
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
and we have an Avenue to restore and
 
03:49:21.469 --> 03:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
retain the people we have which we
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
desperately need and I'm only talking
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
about Department of Correction Personnel
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
we desperately need to retain these
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
people that are capable of retiring
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be a win-win
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
solution if we can establish that
 
03:49:37.349 --> 03:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we continue to retain
 
03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
the people that we would lose
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise and question okay thank you
 
03:49:44.159 --> 03:49:46.309 align:start position:0%
otherwise and question okay thank you
representative

03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming could you explain
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
to me about overtime so this forced
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
overtime is it usually for two hours or
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
is it four or is it a whole
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
shift told me one time that the typical
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
payroll had 3 to four hours of overtime
 
03:50:04.189 --> 03:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
in a twoe payroll with with Department
 
03:50:04.199 --> 03:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
in a twoe payroll with with Department
of

03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
Correction the the force overtime is8
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
hours it's not like a business where you
 
03:50:11.830 --> 03:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
do 2our you went home so you have to man
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
The Post you have to cover the post so
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
when you get forc you forc for 8 hours
 
03:50:19.630 --> 03:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a 16 hour day and you multiply
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
that three and four times a week it is
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
exhausting it's eight hours it's not two
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
hours it's not three hours it's eight
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
hours all right represent
 
03:50:32.830 --> 03:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
leash thanks Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:50:35.229 --> 03:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
coming and you said something that got
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
my attention with your criminal justice
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
class you like 25 people in there and
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
you can't get anyone interested to come
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
and work for the state in Corrections or
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh maybe police work uh so which leads
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
me to the question I asked earlier of Mr
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
will on the
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
retention these are new people they're
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
not interested in coming to the state so
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't make modifications to
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
tierc how are we going to attract new
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
people coming to the state because one
 
03:51:09.070 --> 03:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the things that concerns me a lot and
 
03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative wer and I were here back
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
in 2008 2009 when we were not in the
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
worst situation that we are now I think
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're in a lot worse financial situation
 
03:51:22.830 --> 03:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
as a state now so how do we bridge that
 
03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:24.439 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned you can't get anyone
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
interested now so without making
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
adjustments to say tears I think those
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
who are smart enough to join in criminal
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
justice division they understand what's
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
going on and my question to all of the
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
students is what is a reason why why to
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
waste your time and energy if you're not
 
03:51:43.950 --> 03:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a law enforcement officer in
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
this state my uncle had to leave his job
 
03:51:50.790 --> 03:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
after 14 years working with a state to
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
another state and relocate his family
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
because they Chang his pension away from
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that was a testimony of one of my
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
student and and and as a matter of fact
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
I was the professor of that class and
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was done the same thing to me but
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
obviously I couldn't tell them we need
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
help we wanted to get help but it's also
 
03:52:10.750 --> 03:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
the word of mouth like we are senior
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
most of these people that have been
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
affected by the by the change in 2012
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
these are your captains and lieutenants
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
and Chiefs who are currently training
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
people and keeping people here I think
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
making them happy goes a long way to
 
03:52:28.510 --> 03:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
retaining the people we have right now
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
was that bad experience I don't think
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to help even if you you have
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
people coming through the door yeah they
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
take the $10,000 and we spend $100,000
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
for on them they leave because we never
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
forget what was done to the senior
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
people they change the benefit as of
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
right now there is nothing there is no
 
03:52:49.389 --> 03:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism to stop the state from
 
03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
changing the employment condition
 
03:52:53.790 --> 03:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
because of what was done in 2012 I think
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
fixing it will send a message if the
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
state during difficult time change
 
03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
condition the state will honor its
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
commitment that goes a long way I think
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
to me that's more important than uh the
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
numbers that we are seeing coming in as
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is we're not competing with other
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
state anyways to begin with thanks thank
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman other questions
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
well I ask you about yourself personally

03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
police but some of the calls that come
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
in from the person hey I give for for
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
the fourth time would you be able to
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
bail me out today that's how those calls
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
come in uh the voluntary ones over the
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
weekend when you have time yes but most
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
of the time it come from dire need a
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
friend and a brother calling to another
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
brother and asking I'm getting forc for
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
the fourth time and five the fifth time
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
can you help me and those are very hard
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
ones especially in the line of work we
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
have where we depend on one another
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
those are not an easy task to say and
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
believe me I rarely sleep a 6our sleep
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
rarely which anyone can agree that
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's not normal so and multiply that
 
03:55:06.349 --> 03:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
by the number of people who are working
 
03:55:08.149 --> 03:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
at the prison and it's not only the
 
03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
prison issue it affect every law
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement where they don't have a
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel to actually cover all the
 
03:55:17.469 --> 03:55:17.479 align:start position:0%
shifts and there is another part I I
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
want you all to understand it's not
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
normal for a police officer to say hey
 
03:55:24.429 --> 03:55:24.439 align:start position:0%
you know what we only have two police
 
03:55:27.469 --> 03:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
officers in this town today so we can't
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
cover we don't speak about these issues
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
in public it's like alerting burglars go
 
03:55:33.710 --> 03:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
ahead and start burglarizing other
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
people it's the same thing for Brian he
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
can't say you know I only have two
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
firemen today I can send to respond it's
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
like alarming the public safety for that
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
reason for 10 plus years people have
 
03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
been quiet about these issues generally
 
03:55:50.070 --> 03:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
our line of job we can't really speak in
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
public about it but when it is enough
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's enough and I think we're are
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
reaching to that point okay and our
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
Public Safety needs to representative R
 
03:56:01.030 --> 03:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair you you
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
touched on a really important issue and
 
03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
you did too is when we have forced
 
03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
overtime like that um yes it puts a
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
strain on marriage but I was once in a
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
workplace where we had a lot of overtime
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
time and the children suffered their
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
parent just wasn't home and when the
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
parent was home was exhausted and
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
stressed and I think that's a a a a cost
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
to our the the quality of life we have
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that we have to take
 
03:56:33.790 --> 03:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
into account with these things um I I've
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
seen it firsthand not in my own family I
 
03:56:38.469 --> 03:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
didn't work overtime but I saw it in
 
03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues in um the stress I I hope I I
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
asked the committee that keep those
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
children in mind because they really
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
they're a collateral damage um of of
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
this type of a system and please take me
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
out of the equation because I volunteer
 
03:56:57.429 --> 03:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
to go my assignment is out in the
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
community there are people who don't
 
03:57:01.149 --> 03:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
have an option who are forced to be
 
03:57:04.269 --> 03:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
there four five times a week and that is
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
the reality when you have 45% vacancy
 
03:57:10.030 --> 03:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
over 40 plus when you have 20% vacancy
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and you can't go home you don't have
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
much of an option so so are you saying
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's because there's a difference
 
03:57:17.309 --> 03:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
between a corrections officer and a
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
probation officer so we work in the
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
community so our responsibilities out in
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
the community we are still the part of
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction many provision
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
ofs are volunteered to go help and I
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly speaking I think that's
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
the reason that that place still is
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
floting after 45% V
 
03:57:38.830 --> 03:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
cancy but we still need to be able to
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
hire more people or retain the people we
 
03:57:46.110 --> 03:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
have and out of those 45 %
 
03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy uh or current 55% employees I
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
would guarantee you about 15% of them
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
are eligible to retire because they have
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
over 20 years so uh it's a field where
 
03:58:00.189 --> 03:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
people would stay when they are happy I
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
have seen people working 28 years 29
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
years but it's also a field where people
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
say yeah I can't take this anymore so
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
let's find a common ground where we we
 
03:58:11.309 --> 03:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
can find a win-win solution where the
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
people who are done wrong they' have
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
gotten what they were promised nothing
 
03:58:18.269 --> 03:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
benefit no no no sweetening paent the
 
03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
things that they were promised let's
 
03:58:23.550 --> 03:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
make them whole and we'll move on and I
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have another time as you
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
identify that I don't have another time
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
to come here again next year I've been
 
03:58:31.469 --> 03:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
coming here every year and I want that
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
to end I don't want to come again here
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
let's just be the last year okay all
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
right thank you other no all right all
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
right who's next Mr chairman thank for
 
03:58:45.670 --> 03:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone uh thank you for
 
03:58:50.189 --> 03:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak here my name is
 
03:58:51.510 --> 03:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
Frank Campo and the president of the
 
03:58:54.030 --> 03:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
Troopers Association uh we have about
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
300 members uh should have about 362
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
members um over the past few years and
 
03:59:03.670 --> 03:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
today and last week and last month and
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
six months ago I think we've all um you
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
know talked this through quite a bit and
 
03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
I don't want to uh rehash a lot of what
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
you have all heard over the years over
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
the past few months over the past week
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
um one thing that um I don't really
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
think we've had an example of um while
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
we've had these discussions is sort of a
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
personal example and what has happened
 
03:59:28.149 --> 03:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
um to you know one person that I know um
 
03:59:30.269 --> 03:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
due to these changes that happened in
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
2011 um you know it's a small story it's
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
kind of a you know a microcosm of maybe
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
a a bigger thing but I want to just
 
03:59:38.590 --> 03:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
bring it to a little bit of a personal
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
level for you all to to hear and think
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
about um you know while you uh you know
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
work through the budget here um there's
 
03:59:48.510 --> 03:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine who was hired as a
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
trooper um he came from a family of Law
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers it was in his blood
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
it was all he ever wanted to do was be a
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
state trooper and he his dream came true
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
he got hired I think in 2008 or so and
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
um you know he was for those first few
 
04:00:10.189 --> 04:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
years uh one of the best Troopers going
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
he loved that job I hate to say he loved
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
it more than me um the changes happened
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
in 2012 he was I don't know four or five
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
years into his career smart guy uh one
 
04:00:25.229 --> 04:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
of the smartest people that I know and
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
it killed him but he had to come to the
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
realization that it simply wasn't worth
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
it to stay in this job anymore it was
 
04:00:36.030 --> 04:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
all he's ever wanted to do it crushed
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
his dreams those changes that happened
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
um in 2012 uh shortly after that a
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
couple years after I believe he ended up
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh leaving the state police
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and you know he still checks in uh with
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
me to this day um still hates the fact
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
that he had to leave but um he had to do
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
what was best for his family and that
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was to leave and you know
 
04:01:00.990 --> 04:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
again that's just a a small story um
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
just just one guy but I can tell you as
 
04:01:06.309 --> 04:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
I testified on Wednesday in my 20 plus
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
years or 20 years at the State Police
 
04:01:10.110 --> 04:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
here I've seen that happen scores of
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
times we've had talented men and women
 
04:01:14.830 --> 04:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
leave this place because it just simply
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't worth it to stay so I just kind
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
of want to um you know just bring that
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
down to maybe a little bit of a personal
 
04:01:22.830 --> 04:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
level um for you all um and maybe
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
something a little different that you
 
04:01:26.990 --> 04:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
may not have heard before and uh that's
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
really all I have this afternoon unless
 
04:01:30.670 --> 04:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
there's any questions so in your
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
friend's case did he move to some other
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
job that was unrelated to law he did he
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
moved to another job that was unrelated
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement yes got you um now
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
you said you had 300 members is that in
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
all three tiers is that yes they span
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
all three tiers yes sir okay and are
 
04:01:49.750 --> 04:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
there many uh tier A's left or they
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's a handful I'd say
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
about probably less than 10 okay yep so
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's about 80 to 100 in tier B and
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
then the rest would be uh tier C gotcha
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
so the bulk is tier C at this point yes
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
sir yes great other
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
questions no I'm not seeing any hands
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
04:02:12.269 --> 04:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to talk yes come
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again uh I'm John selli
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh Sergeant with nationville Police
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
Department I'm here representing the New
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Association uh I just
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to come back up to clarify things a
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
couple things I don't think uh
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh leechman got his
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
answer as far as the terc portion I
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
don't think it was clear in the
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
importance of why we're here for the
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
tier B folks um as it currently sits
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
there was a recent article uh from do
 
04:02:47.229 --> 04:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
police and I mentioned it in my
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the other day with each tier B
 
04:02:53.550 --> 04:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
member that leaves prematurely or as
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
soon as they can without staying uh and
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
retaining those folks we're creating
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
another vacancy each vacancy takes
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 months to fill between
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
testing background police academy and
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
then uh training field training for
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
those officers because we don't want to
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
just throw them out there uh and that
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
cost the the city of and I I'll speak to
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
NASA and and their article said about
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
100,000 Nash was about1 to $120,000 for
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
that cost and then you compound that
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
with you have to fill those vacancies
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
with overtime so it's probably more like
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
$200,000 cost uh to the cities and towns
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
and when you start getting into a single
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
Department losing you know four and five
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
folks a year on this um you're creating
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
that burnout for those folks that need
 
04:03:40.590 --> 04:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
to be forced uh you're creating uh a
 
04:03:41.790 --> 04:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
problem with the vacancies in the
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
communities but it's very important to
 
04:03:47.469 --> 04:03:47.479 align:start position:0%
identify the reason to keep these tier B
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
folks is so we do have that time to
 
04:03:53.550 --> 04:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
potentially correct the ti sea folks or
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to recruit more people
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
um you know and and as Brian said
 
04:04:02.189 --> 04:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
earlier I mean will somebody be back
 
04:04:04.349 --> 04:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
here for TRC I'm sure at some point they
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
probably will be um but in the meantime
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
we need to stop that bleeding we need to
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
stop the water going through the dam and
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's by retaining the folks that we
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
have and then work on those other folks
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them uh at least I know in
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
my uh Department have said I knew what I
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
signed up for I don't love it but I knew
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
what I signed up for and I'm here for
 
04:04:28.590 --> 04:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
that and uh they do view this as a
 
04:04:30.990 --> 04:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
stepping stone uh you know a first phase
 
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
to potentially uh creating the entire
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the system at some point uh
 
04:04:37.469 --> 04:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
whatever that may look like but they
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
have until 2037 to to kind of work that
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
out representative Ms thank you uh Mr
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming in and
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for your service to your
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
community um about how many uh police
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
officers across the state are in tier
 
04:04:56.309 --> 04:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
B when the changes were in uh enacted it
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
was 1800 well police offices I don't
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
know the total was
 
04:05:04.510 --> 04:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
1821 uh I don't have that number as far
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
as how many are in currently in terb I
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
know a number of them from my department
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
alone have retired um but I don't have
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
an exact number that would be a
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
retirement board question I apologize I
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
didn't prepare for
 
04:05:21.550 --> 04:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
that all right other questions um yeah
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make ask you something so um
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
you talked about trying to recruit
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
better right um one of the problems that
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
we have as a state is just a lack of
 
04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
young people right we we see in our
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
schools uh a a declining population over
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
time right it's just a matter of there
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
aren't as many
 
04:05:50.670 --> 04:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
births and and uh so 10 years ago I
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
think or or 12 there was maybe um
 
04:05:57.790 --> 04:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
220,000 public school kids and now
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's 160,000 that kind of thing right
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
and so um and that's where we draw from
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
for these kind of jobs right it's people
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
out of high school and
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
so there may just not be the
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
availability right of of more people
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we pay them uh to to
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
take these jobs what do you think agreed
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
um there's certainly a shortage of work
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
staff across every entity uh I can I
 
04:06:29.950 --> 04:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
know that nashaa
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
is either the highest or one of the top
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
two or three highest paid in the state
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
and we are not fully staffed uh we have
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
lost more since 2015 than we've been
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
able to recruit and we've recruited 10
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
12 a year every single year and that
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's a lot for law enforcement
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
especially a local agency um but you
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
just we we were unable to keep up with
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
it uh so again I mean I think that just
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
solidifies our point that we need to
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
retain what we have while we try to
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
figure out that problem and get more
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
people uh and back to my testimony the
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
other day uh you're right we we only
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
have we have 107 out of 164 police
 
04:07:10.510 --> 04:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
officers are from
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh so yeah it's difficult
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
to I think we have 45 from uh New
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then the rest are from out
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
of state we have some from Arizona
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
Florida Colorado that have moved this
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
way and they've sought out National
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
Police Department to work which is great
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
um but yeah we don't have the high New
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire contingency coming out and for
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
for this job so we need to retain what
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
we have before we run into a crisis like
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh Probation and Parole and Corrections
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
U imagine if our law enforcement on the
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
street was down 45% 50%
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
what that would look like yeah represent
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
R thank you um thank you Sergeant for
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
number of people from Massachusetts that
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
have come to work in the NASA police
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
department how would you say um using
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
Nash as an example how competitive are
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
we are with other states I mean if we
 
04:08:05.550 --> 04:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
are not getting
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
homegrown uh law enforcement officers
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire I mean we can recruit
 
04:08:13.109 --> 04:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
young people to come in and move to New
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire take these jobs and raise
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
their families
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
whatever so how I mean can you comment
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
on that about as far as our
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
competitiveness with neighboring states
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
speaking to myself I left Massachusetts
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement 13 years because the
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
wages were competitive and the
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
retirement was better uh today I look
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
back and I say I could have retired in
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
two years from now with 80% of my pay in
 
04:08:42.429 --> 04:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
in healthcare um so today we're not as
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
competitive our salaries are certainly
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
close to you know Massachusetts our cost
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
of living in New Hampshire has gone up
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
significantly because we have so many
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
people moving up to our state because it
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
is a great state um but right now we're
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
not nearly as competitive as we need to
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
be how about um other aspects of the job
 
04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
you know safety uh level of crime all
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff yeah well I came from
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
a a police department in sagus uh of 6
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
to a police department of when I got
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
hired I think we were
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
170 um we're a far safer State we do a
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
much better job training uh I do think
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
that Nashua and I'm going to be biased I
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
think we're the best agency you know
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
around for sure uh we do a great deal of
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
training we do a really good job of uh
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
making sure our officers are safe and
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're going home at the end of the night
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
I uh is comparative to mass mass um we
 
04:09:44.349 --> 04:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
did not train the same way uh they did
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
not it wasn't as safety conscious as we
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire uh I think we
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
have far less officers going out workers
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
work related injuries uh things like
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
that so I think we're a much better
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
State we hold everyone to the same
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
standard where Mass there's all over the
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
state and uh they have different
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
trainings here uh we're all trained the
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
same way and I think we do a very good
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
job okay and but some of that may have
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
just changed everywhere over time right
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
people in general might be more safety
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
con not just than they once were or
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
something like that it's a well uh I
 
04:10:19.630 --> 04:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
mean if you look at the stats across
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
across the country I think ours haven't
 
04:10:24.510 --> 04:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
our crime hasn't gone up the same way it
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
has in the Midwest and some other places
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
in the country so I think we do a very
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
good job and um even with the declining
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
numbers we're still still doing that
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
great all right thank you very much are
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
there others who want to speak
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.080 --> 04:10:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:10:45.070 --> 04:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
good

team uh I'm going to start with um
 
04:11:12.680 --> 04:11:13.790 align:start position:0%
team uh I'm going to start with um
something

04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:11:15.309 --> 04:11:15.319 align:start position:0%
that has to do with me these guys did a
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job explaining the
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances that exist in their
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
agencies um so I'm going to briefly
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
touch on on my agency and then I'm I'm
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
here really to talk about some nuts and
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
bolts stuff with the LBA handout um the
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
city of man I worked for the city of
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire I've worked for
 
04:11:34.750 --> 04:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire for 22 years when I
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
started in Manchester in 2003 we did
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 16,000 calls for service
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
this year we will surpass 30,000 calls
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
for service
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
we are doing that this year without
 
04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
engine one without ladder two and
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
without ladder five those units were
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
closed years ago
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
um due to a number of reasons that
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
Staffing reduction has led to uh
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
substantial strains on the
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
department now you you would bring
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
forward a employee problem with the
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.309 --> 04:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
in this is a this is a legislative
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm choosing my my words
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
carefully um a human in a seat is not
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily good for the taxpayer right
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
you need someone that knows what they're
 
04:12:34.990 --> 04:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
doing and one of the things that is
 
04:12:37.389 --> 04:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
concerning is you know one of the things
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the the loss of personnel I have a
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
sticker inside my helmet that says
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
firefighting is an ultra hazardous
 
04:12:45.149 --> 04:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
person profession because it
 
04:12:48.429 --> 04:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
is and the only way that those hazardous
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
situations are dealt with are through
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
training but through
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
experience when we lose someone that has
 
04:12:55.119 --> 04:12:56.590 align:start position:0%
experience when we lose someone that has
substantial

04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:12:59.550 --> 04:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
experience the the it's hard to quantify
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
a loss at that level right because what
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
encompasses a career in someone is a
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
plethora of of different things and the
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
diversity of response the diversity of
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
situations that we've seen allows
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
command St staffs and those that in this
 
04:13:17.469 --> 04:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
case of the fire service command of fire
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
decisions we are at a kind of a critical
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
point here at least in the city of
 
04:13:27.469 --> 04:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester with the way our seniority
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
Works in that if we do not retain tib
 
04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
people the knowledge loss is going to be
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
substantial okay and we are going to be
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
in situations where we are already
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
promoting People Too Young that have to
 
04:13:44.670 --> 04:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
make decisions to which their level of
 
04:13:49.229 --> 04:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
there the mandatory overtime situation
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
and the situation to which we are hiring
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
has become so complicated that we had to
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
buy software to do that never had to do
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
that when I started they just did it
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
with a phone we're literally now having
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
to use software to to be able to fill
 
04:14:07.710 --> 04:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me fill the positions and the
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that the city of Manchester
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
demands on on that fire department um we
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have have we didn't even have the
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
term mandatory over time when I started
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
didn't even exist so that whole thing um
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
on the very rare occasion that that we
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
would have a problem they would close a
 
04:14:28.590 --> 04:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
firehouse today it is here we go
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime and there's a process
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
for that so I tested with 400 people for
 
04:14:40.109 --> 04:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
nine positions to create a hiring list
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
today the city of Manchester has zero no
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
no one and we just filled a FEMA grant
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
that they struggled to fill for 12
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
positions because of our understaffing
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
is so bad we've the federal government
 
04:14:57.389 --> 04:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
has has given us a grant so um you know
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's not unique to Manchester as the
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
the gentleman alluded to you know every
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
agency is having having problems so I
 
04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring forward my agency's
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
experience and my my 22 plus years in
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester and how things
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
changed with that so there that that's
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
just my personal anecdote now as far as
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts here um I was not
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
here when the LBA handed out this
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
document that tries to go through the
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
changes I think there were some things
 
04:15:30.750 --> 04:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
that were not questions that were not
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
answered some things that were not
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
answered correctly um and upon review of
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
this there are nine nine typos in this
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
that on current law that exists in this
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
document so um you know there was some
 
04:15:44.670 --> 04:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised and I'm happy
 
04:15:46.750 --> 04:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
to certainly happy to go through this
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
with anybody but some of the things that
 
04:15:50.429 --> 04:15:50.439 align:start position:0%
are in here the changes are were done at
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
the request of the retirement system
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me what what document are you
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
looking at it's the one that was handed
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
out it just says group two pension
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
reform hb2 the sideways one all right I
 
04:16:01.950 --> 04:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
think we have to look for yeah all right
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.510 --> 04:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
that this one
 
04:16:17.550 --> 04:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
the T the typos are a let's go at Page
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
by Page we can go Page by Page you're
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
so you don't have it it should have been
 
04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
on the table in front not that one no no
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's the one that
 
04:16:53.229 --> 04:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
right I I got I U picked this up in here
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:17:00.590 --> 04:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay so what's what's wrong with this
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
one this one has has uh house buillt two
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
2023 house bu two
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
2025 House Bill 4
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.309 --> 04:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um can do that I mean run next door
 
04:17:24.109 --> 04:17:24.119 align:start position:0%
our I mean this is today's date right so
 
04:17:27.109 --> 04:17:27.119 align:start position:0%
um why don't we give you this one that
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
we all have all
 
04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
one this is this
 
04:17:43.109 --> 04:17:43.119 align:start position:0%
is the only reason this other one works
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
so good is because it shows you what's
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
being crossed out I mean it's the
 
04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
typical way that we do we do legislation
 
04:17:48.760 --> 04:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
typical way that we do we do legislation
here

04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
so I mean I
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
can yeah y this is this is I'm not sure
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's our document I'm trying to find
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
it but I I don't yeah no that came right
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
out of this room this is from here from
 
04:18:05.790 --> 04:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
last week so what page of
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
hb2 like
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
28 oh man okay I that I I don't have a
 
04:18:14.670 --> 04:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
cross reference
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
all right I mean I'm willing to there's
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
nothing on here all right let's we'll
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
we'll break until uh for five minutes
 
04:18:23.670 --> 04:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
and Jack will make copies of what
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on here that is uh I
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's oh yeah which is fine it just
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
highlights we'll come back at at Theos
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.720 --> 04:19:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
there's

04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:11.720 --> 04:19:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.640 --> 04:20:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.640 --> 04:20:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.640 --> 04:21:11.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.560 --> 04:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.520 --> 04:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.520 --> 04:22:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.439 --> 04:23:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.439 --> 04:23:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.439 --> 04:24:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.359 --> 04:24:41.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.319 --> 04:25:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.950 --> 04:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is the
 
04:25:55.960 --> 04:26:11.229 align:start position:0%
this is this is the
problem

04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.239 --> 04:26:41.229 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right let's get started again thank
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
you representative well thank you sir
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair and so one of the things
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
that that happened in order
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
to make changes specifically to group
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
two is there's a lot of sections in RSA
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
100a that apply to both so you had to
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
separate them out and that's what most
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
of this is um in the case of
 
04:27:42.920 --> 04:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
of this is um in the case of
the

04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
strikeout you wanted to go Page by Page
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
sure current law so vested right that is
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
a request of the
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
courts because the RSA 100a does not
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
contain a definition of the word
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
vested which makes us the only plan that
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
I could find without a definition of the
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
word vested we have operated under a
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
Pres resumption of 10
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
years and that's based on a on a
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
disability benefit but but in
 
04:28:21.750 --> 04:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
definitions it just didn't didn't
 
04:28:25.469 --> 04:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
exist so that that's the purpose of
 
04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the the 10 years of service
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
remained as it is in current law right
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
now so there's the budget implication is
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
zero it's no change
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
um the rest of page one really applies
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
to page two because it's cut when it
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
separated out when there are certain
 
04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
phrases that existed in the hole that
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't apply to group one or don't apply
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
to group two so as you saw in my
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
handwriting red you know renumber to two
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
and three because the section two is
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
redundant that was removed at the
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
request of Mr Carlin because it appears
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in law it doesn't take
 
04:29:10.030 --> 04:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
that away it just it's listed twice so
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
he's like it doesn't need to be in here
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
twice that was just language cleanup um
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then the compensation for extra and
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
special Duty that doesn't exist in group
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
one so that's why it struck there
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
because it's it applies to group two
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
only um right so this is basically
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
separating out there's a lot of mixture
 
04:29:31.710 --> 04:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
between one and two and so on and this
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
is making a cleaner correct here's a one
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
here's a 2 a here's a
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
2B and when this was done this this was
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
done in Hill 436 for the most part and
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
it was run through the the retirement
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
system to make one to make sure it was
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
correct obviously right and two because
 
04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
there were nuances in language that
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
obviously they understand far better
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
than I do right so so again on page
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
three the removal of permanent firemen
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
and permanent policemen doesn't apply to
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
one uh on page four the reason it's and
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
is because it had commas and when you
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
only have two you can't you need the
 
04:30:12.269 --> 04:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
word and that's right that's right and
 
04:30:13.830 --> 04:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing with the paragraph
 
04:30:16.510 --> 04:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
below when you you had three references
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
you drop to two you need the word and
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
five the word and Mr chairman I think
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
while we're on the record it's important
 
04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
to point out this is not an LBA document
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know where I we don't know
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
where it came from we have never seen
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
this document nor have we handed it out
 
04:30:41.070 --> 04:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
I think maybe a lobbyist might have left
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
it there one day but this is the first
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
time this is a a substantial amount of
 
04:30:48.429 --> 04:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
work whoever did it and they they might
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
I we have never seen that before and we
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
members I got it in
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
here okay it it may have just for the
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
just for the record it's not all right
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
so maybe uh Carol left it here yeah
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what happened I will show
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
it to her and we it may have come from
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
the chair of Edna all right but that's
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
possible sure we'll just make it clear
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
on this video that we are looking at at
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
a document that we are unable to
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
possibly make public because we don't
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
know where it came from so well I can
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
tell you that having gone through it
 
04:31:22.109 --> 04:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
other than the typos that we'll talk
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
about at the end with the transcription
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
everything's accurate um so like on page
 
04:31:29.070 --> 04:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
so getting into page
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
seven where we start talking about some
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
of some of the dates and the movement of
 
04:31:36.990 --> 04:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
time um so what about page five there's
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of new stuff here so so P when
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
well when you separate group one you
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
have to make a par for group two I see
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
you have no choice right it doesn't
 
04:31:47.070 --> 04:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
exist so the entire paragraph becomes
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
technically new language because it
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
didn't exist but it's the same it is so
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
it is the same with the
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
differentiations right because group one
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
and group two are now separated out go
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay and it it just runs through Page
 
04:32:05.040 --> 04:32:09.510 align:start position:0%
okay and it it just runs through Page
Six

04:32:09.510 --> 04:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay so the way that this the way that
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
this works is this whole thing works is
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
you can't well you could in theory have
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
this done in one shot but of course the
 
04:32:23.469 --> 04:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
price tag is atrocious so this is a this
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
does two things it transitions this over
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
time to so it's not a a huge hit at once
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
but it also contains a
 
04:32:35.550 --> 04:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
concession over
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
time in that concession is that the
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
length of
 
04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
service that was added to those careers
 
04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
remains that is a concession that was
 
04:32:46.840 --> 04:32:48.229 align:start position:0%
remains that is a concession that was
made

04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
by the stakeholders in order for this to
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
work they are the in the changes that
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2011 that forced them to
 
04:33:02.109 --> 04:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
there okay so that's when you're going
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
to you're starting to see the dates the
 
04:33:08.029 --> 04:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
January 1 of 12 dates are starting to
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
get in the
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
gray mhm that's why that's why those are
 
04:33:15.709 --> 04:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the movement of time
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
year to year now I will say at the
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of seven in number two where it
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
says and who have not attained vested
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
status prior to January 1 of 12 if you
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
were hired in Janu July 1 of 11 there is
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
no scenario in the world that gets you
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
vested in six months so that so that
 
04:33:33.150 --> 04:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
language is a cleanup it was a request
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
of of the retirement system it just
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
didn't it just didn't need to be there
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
again separate page eight is a
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
separation of one and two so that's why
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
paragraphs A and B are the
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
same but it differentiates between the
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
two and then you get down to a paragraph
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
D1 which is group two and again the
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
transitioning of the
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
dates is is all that is that's why it's
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
the only thing highlighted is the date
 
04:34:10.959 --> 04:34:14.709 align:start position:0%
the only thing highlighted is the date
itself

04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.629 --> 04:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately on page nine and again
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
we we've made it abundantly clear that
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
this document did not come from the
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
LBA um for some reason the someone
 
04:34:29.230 --> 04:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
transcribed 2012 to
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
2021 easy thing to do we've all done it
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's so I just don't what I don't want
 
04:34:34.160 --> 04:34:34.949 align:start position:0%
that's so I just don't what I don't want
is

04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
confusion for anyone that had this to
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is affecting 2021 in
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
backwards that that is not the case in
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
any way it's just merely a
 
04:34:47.230 --> 04:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
typo and then unfortunately you're
 
04:34:48.990 --> 04:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
saying the actual document doesn't have
 
04:34:50.830 --> 04:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
that it does not no it does not have the
 
04:34:55.470 --> 04:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
typo so unfortunately that typo carries
 
04:34:55.480 --> 04:34:57.590 align:start position:0%
typo so unfortunately that typo carries
through

04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
um several
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
places now we'll move to page 13 and
 
04:35:08.429 --> 04:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
just for the new folks to explain why
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the chart on page 13 became
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
larger the original
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
chart clumped groups together in 2year
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
chunks with the exception of the fir the
 
04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
the last one which was a four-year chunk
 
04:35:25.949 --> 04:35:25.959 align:start position:0%
all that the expansion of the chart at
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom did was just put it Year bye
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
it did not change conditions age
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier nothing all it did was it
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
separated it from two-year blocks into
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
oneyear blocks so that as this bill
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
Works through annually you can make an
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
ual change if we had not done that it
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
would have created disparity depending
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
on when you were hired where some people
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
would had to work two years longer and
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
others maybe six months that isn't
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
really fair so by separating it out it
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
left it more more Equitable as it went
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
through that's all it did but the
 
04:36:02.349 --> 04:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
conditions itself there is no there is
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
what does it
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
mean it look toward the top at least six
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
years but 22 age 47 right so what
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
happened is in
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
2011 in 2011 what h a couple things
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
happened when you looked at the changes
 
04:36:37.150 --> 04:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
that were made to group two and you took
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
an individual change by itself a lot of
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
them seem kind of minor innocuous right
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
but the problem was is they had a
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect whereas okay I was
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
subject to this change but that number
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
is now subject to this event which was
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
changed which is now subject to a third
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
event which was changed and when you
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
looked at it holistically which was not
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
done you realize and this is why Senator
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
Bradley made the statement on the floor
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
of the Senate recorded on the floor of
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate that this we went way too far
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
because they didn't look at it cumula
 
04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
they were just looking at in individual
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
chunks so let me start with that now as
 
04:37:20.109 --> 04:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
far as your question Mr
 
04:37:23.070 --> 04:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
chairman repeat it please so if you look
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
at this highlighted stuff toward the top
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
of the page on 13 on page 13 yep as
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
number one less than four years 24 age
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
49 2.1% so the conditions that existed
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
when these people were hired is they had
 
04:37:41.709 --> 04:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
to do 20 years of service and be 45
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
years old okay so what this does is it
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
they're really columns here they're
 
04:37:48.189 --> 04:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
columns yeah unfortunately that didn't
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't translate well in the so so
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
24 is years of service minimum years of
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
service correct right okay minimum years
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
age is their minimum age and then they
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
get 2.1% correct for that gotcha yep
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
those those conditions here like I said
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
when the chart expanded have not changed
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
mhm the other thing is that the and that
 
04:38:17.789 --> 04:38:17.799 align:start position:0%
that is a concession that was was agreed
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
upon really right I I want you guys to
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand that the the folks behind me
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
the group two Coalition did not walk
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
into a room and slam their fist on a
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
table that that didn't happen they have
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
an incentive as well as we do as a
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to make the pension system
 
04:38:33.439 --> 04:38:35.189 align:start position:0%
legislature to make the pension system
work

04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
so that's what ultimately happened is
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
they said okay we understand that the
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
most expensive element to a change in
 
04:38:43.949 --> 04:38:43.959 align:start position:0%
the pension system is a reduction in
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
length of service because the longer you
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
work in a system the better it actually
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
is for the system
 
04:38:50.480 --> 04:38:52.629 align:start position:0%
is for the system
financially

04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
financially
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
so that is a concession that they agreed
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
upon and it's not minor when you're
 
04:39:01.150 --> 04:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
asking someone to work longer at a
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
minimum you are in essence
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's you're you are forcing their
 
04:39:08.000 --> 04:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
it's you're you are forcing their
employment

04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
so I I that's
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's really not a minor ask they that
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
was a
 
04:39:17.789 --> 04:39:17.799 align:start position:0%
serious concession on the on the group
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
two folks part but that so just so we
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand the other thing is that this
 
04:39:24.750 --> 04:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
chart and it's been I've had six or
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
eight people now at say well the title
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the chart isn't highlighted it
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the date did you miss
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
something no the reason the title of the
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
chart still has the 2011 date is because
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
if you choose to leave early you suffer
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
a penalty for doing so you do not get
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this proposed change if
 
04:39:48.510 --> 04:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
you don't agree to the deal that's in
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
front of you so if you leave early you
 
04:39:53.708 --> 04:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
are going to then have to fall under the
 
04:39:53.718 --> 04:39:54.750 align:start position:0%
are going to then have to fall under the
prior

04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
prior
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
conditions that is a retention element
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
gotcha to say what's the less than four
 
04:40:04.510 --> 04:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
years part that's four years of service
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
so so less than four years of service
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
would mean you were hired in
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
200 N or 10 or 11
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
that was that was the time of service
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
that you had in group two as of July 1
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
of 2011 oh okay yeah so this is as of
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
gotcha so July 1 of 2011 is the is the
 
04:40:25.640 --> 04:40:25.650 align:start position:0%
large Line in the
 
04:40:25.650 --> 04:40:26.788 align:start position:0%
large Line in the
[Music]

04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
Sand for so F folks that were hired
 
04:40:32.350 --> 04:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
after that date are tier C folks I
 
04:40:36.270 --> 04:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
understand yep yes represent so is that
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
a typo then when it says credible
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
service on minimum years minimum annuity
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
January 1 2012 so that no oh okay it is
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
not a typo okay so you're so
 
04:40:51.628 --> 04:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
2011 that's kind of the cutof date so
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
written it's almost I'm trying to think
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
of some jargon it's almost like the word
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
Cruiser and cop car mean the same thing
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
right right they do except that when you
 
04:41:12.310 --> 04:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
do that in law saying you are hired July
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
111 or you were vested as
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
of that's that that's both ways of
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
coming to a date in using two different
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
methods okay so it makes unfortunately
 
04:41:28.510 --> 04:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
this complicated to read because it's
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
interchanging two terms now when we get
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the end of this you'll see that that
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
has been completely cleaned up at the
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
end but that's not going to occur until
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
2034 okay all right let's let's let's
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
move on I think I understand this so
 
04:41:47.310 --> 04:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
again the the typo parts are listed the
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
reason on 14 it says not in fiscal note
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I crossed off the word not there was
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
a question that was that came before
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
Edna in reference to a fiscal note that
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
was assigned to House Bill 727 that bill
 
04:42:03.310 --> 04:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
has a typo in it and we weren't sure if
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note reflected a typo or if
 
04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
it reflected actual current law we have
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
since consulted with Jan who is the
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
director of the retirement system and
 
04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
she assured me that they caught that
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
typo and that the fiscal note was done
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
with current law not the typo in 727 so
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was just a note that's why that
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
note is there for me frankly but that's
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's why it's there all 2021 should
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
be2 correct and and as you right as you
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
get through that into 16 it like I said
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
they were just those are just the typos
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
now where
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
the Roman numeral meets the column here
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.910 --> 04:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
16 this is how
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
this works as far as transitioning folks
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
let me ask about 15 sure uh effective
 
04:42:58.760 --> 04:43:00.270 align:start position:0%
let me ask about 15 sure uh effective
date

04:43:00.270 --> 04:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
2034 correct so what's that so what that
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
does is this here is
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
where we are in let me make make sure I
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
get this
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
right we are now starting to get into
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
the situation where the vested as and
 
04:43:22.868 --> 04:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
the hiring date are being cleaned up to
 
04:43:22.878 --> 04:43:23.788 align:start position:0%
the hiring date are being cleaned up to
just

04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
become one word in the removal of the
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
reference of 100 A5 2D which is that
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
chart that had the age in length the
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
service you just referenced that chart
 
04:43:38.670 --> 04:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
expires it goes away so if there's any
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
references in in statute to a chart
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
can't they can't be there because the
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
chart no longer exists so it just
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
removes our reference to a chart that
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist anymore I see okay go
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
ahead this is with the the program
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
changes year to year correct right see
 
04:43:59.390 --> 04:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay yep so at the like I said at the
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
end it when the chart goes away any
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
reference to that and you'll you'll see
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
that on 16 17 and 18 the and that runs
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
you through the
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
it condenses the changes into the
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
paragraphs annually is just how that I
 
04:44:19.750 --> 04:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
personally I don't like it it was the
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
insistence of OSS to write it this
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
way HB 436 I thought wrote it in a way
 
04:44:27.550 --> 04:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
that was a little bit easier to
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
understand but that was I lost that
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
fight with with ol so new we have a new
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney that handles the
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
pension stuff straka retired and uh he
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
has his own style
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
so at the at the
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
end where you get the 2034 references
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
that all of the January 1 2034
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
references are done to eliminate the
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
double speak as to establishing a date
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
and just simply puts it at July 1 of 11
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's a hard Line in the Sand and it
 
04:45:06.750 --> 04:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
makes it easy for a lay person to read
 
04:45:09.390 --> 04:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
and understand
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay prior to the these changes in 2011
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
people filled out their request for a
 
04:45:16.750 --> 04:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
pension on a
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
postcard now they have to go in and make
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
an appointment they get a preliminary
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
number they have to see my fine friend
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
back here who is both a numbers
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
scruncher and an attorney they will give
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
you a
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
guess it's a guess as to what you're
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
getting you will receive the start of
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
your pension with a reduced number and
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
when they finally figure it out they'll
 
04:45:42.990 --> 04:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
adjust it retroactive ly paywise and you
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
will get your final
 
04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
number that used to be an appointment
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
that took 20 minutes and
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's in a perfect world we would go back
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
to something far more
 
04:45:55.868 --> 04:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
simpler um
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
but this this these changes here that
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
are proposed in House Bill 2 do simplify
 
04:46:02.718 --> 04:46:04.750 align:start position:0%
are proposed in House Bill 2 do simplify
things

04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
eventually but it's just going to take
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
some time represent Ms thank you Mr
 
04:46:11.470 --> 04:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for coming in so I
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
just I want to make sure I'm clear so
 
04:46:17.868 --> 04:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
with with the changes that you've
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted it this this reflects what
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's ask is this is out of
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
house bill to this is the governor's ask
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay yep thank you if if I wrote
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
this it would if I was submitting this
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
it would look a little different but um
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
this is this
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
is you know she she wants what she wants
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I was happy to oblige in her request
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
of me um and I did what she
 
04:46:46.200 --> 04:46:48.310 align:start position:0%
of me um and I did what she
asked

04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
asked
 
04:46:48.320 --> 04:46:51.390 align:start position:0%
asked
okay

04:46:51.390 --> 04:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.628 --> 04:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.990 --> 04:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
um page four of our main document that
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
we got today right this
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
one we're actually seeing the cost of
 
04:47:04.160 --> 04:47:06.110 align:start position:0%
one we're actually seeing the cost of
these

04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:47:06.120 --> 04:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
these
things

04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 2 has
 
04:47:14.240 --> 04:47:15.948 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 2 has
introduced

04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
2025 237 million present cost this is if
 
04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
we had that much today that's what it
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
would cost you know paying it out over
 
04:47:28.350 --> 04:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
different um but House Bill 2
 
04:47:35.830 --> 04:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
2023 two years
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
ago is Le half them so
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
interesting there there is an element Mr
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
chair that that is could be better
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
explained by the retirement system but
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
I've I've heard his explanation a dozen
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
times so I'll give it a shot here the
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
retirement system invests money and
 
04:48:00.910 --> 04:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
money has a time element to it when you
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
make an investment so when this when the
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
the first proposal to make a change in
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
this occurred in 2 th my first term
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
which was four terms ago that had a a
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal cost of $136 million for a
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
complete in total one-time
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
shot as time has progressed and every
 
04:48:24.270 --> 04:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
delay that has occurred it has added a
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
roughly between 25 and $28 million a
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
year so the progression of time is an
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
enemy to to solving the problem because
 
04:48:37.708 --> 04:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.430 --> 04:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing that changes is the is
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
the Corpus of the folks has been reduced
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
we're losing people that were in this
 
04:48:54.830 --> 04:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
original group of 1800 that is now in
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
the 1600s so there that makes an
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment as well gotcha Mr chair yes
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent um to you know to your to your
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
point I mean if I'm reading this chart
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
correctly it looks like the significant
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
hb2 two years ago and hb2 now looks like
 
04:49:16.830 --> 04:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the treatment of uh
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
extra what esdp extra service duty
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
pay I mean it it you know if you look at
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
the the comments that the differen is it
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
says the cost difference between HB 727
 
04:49:32.670 --> 04:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
is which is essentially the same as hb2
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
of two years ago is largely attributable
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
to hb2 of this year not containing the
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
change in maximum benefit and
 
04:49:42.750 --> 04:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating the seven-year rule for
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
esdp can you talk about talk to that CU
 
04:49:48.750 --> 04:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's that looks like that's
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
160 million all right before you go
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson representative
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
Sweeny would like to say just I would
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
just say it looks like underneath hb2 as
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
introduced there's hb2 2025 without the
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
omission of esdp so they already
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
calculated that for us between 237 237
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
million and 194 million
 
04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
25.6 a year
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
contrib is unavailable is this what they
 
04:50:19.510 --> 04:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
were telling us was probably a typo in
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
04:50:24.110 --> 04:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
language I think retirement's here if
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
they want yeah okay come on I I I guess
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
the you know if I could I mean if you're
 
04:50:30.750 --> 04:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
asking him intent on the governor's
 
04:50:30.760 --> 04:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
asking him intent on the governor's
language

04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
he I'm not I was just I've been cross
 
04:50:37.708 --> 04:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
referencing the document that representa
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson brought and yes it's there's
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
definitely some issues I don't even
 
04:50:43.548 --> 04:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
think we should and I not I know you did
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and because it's not our
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
document it's not retirement's document
 
04:50:50.590 --> 04:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
and it makes things even more confusing
 
04:50:52.110 --> 04:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
when you try to cross reference what's
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the document that you know Steve
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
picked up over there a week or so ago
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
but retirement is here I hopefully I can
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
speak their
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
numers I agree okay and it's getting
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
late on a Friday
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
coming again I'm Mark Kavanaugh
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
Deputy counsel and compliance
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
officer um Marty's replacement was here
 
04:51:19.230 --> 04:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
but he had to leave oh we have one
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
another commitment he started on Monday
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
great and we'll be working together he
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
and I the rest of this session and and
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
what's his name his name is
 
04:51:31.868 --> 04:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
Rick faio you might recognize the name
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
as he came to us from B he was a
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
lobbyist at Bia great business industry
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
so before I started the chart I just
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to clarify a couple of things that
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson mentioned okay
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of vested in our
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
statute it's not in the definition
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
statute but it's an RSA
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
10810 and that says that if a member has
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
10 years of service at the time they
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
terminate work but aren't old enough to
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
retire they can collect a benefit when
 
04:52:06.430 --> 04:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
they get old enough and that's called a
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
vested deferred benefit that's where the
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
10 years comes from gotcha we don't need
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
a separate definition I understand okay
 
04:52:18.030 --> 04:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
second um when he I don't know if this
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
clarifies but um the way these options
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
work is that successively moving the
 
04:52:29.110 --> 04:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
vested by date year by year by year
 
04:52:29.120 --> 04:52:30.030 align:start position:0%
vested by date year by year by year
until

04:52:30.030 --> 04:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:52:32.788 --> 04:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
2034 is what encompasses all the current
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
tib members and that's why that chart
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
goes away because there will everyone
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
will have already been fixed uh and last
 
04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
let me ask just a detail about that
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
suppose someone stopped working for 5
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
years and then came back is that an
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
issue or is that well I it's a footnote
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
in my chart and oh okay and I can speak
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
to that it's an ambiguity okay but
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't happen that often right
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
so don't know but this might incentivize
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
people yeah
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
lastly um he said you fill out an
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
estimate card and and that's how you get
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
counseled anyone can have an appointment
 
04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
but in this day and age people go on the
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
internet just want a file or they want
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
an estimate card and send it in but
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
anyone can come in as many times as they
 
04:53:24.270 --> 04:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
want and spend an hour or two with one
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
of our benefit Specialists and go over
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
everything we didn't change our rules
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
behavior of our membership
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
changed okay enough on that um so the
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of this uh document is to to
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
compare the provisions
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
between hb2
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
2023 hb2 727 from earlier this year in
 
04:53:50.240 --> 04:53:52.310 align:start position:0%
2023 hb2 727 from earlier this year in
hb2

04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
2025 many of them the same but there
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
were two or three significant
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
differences that account for the
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
variations in cost on the last page so
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation those changes are
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
the same in all three bills
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
calculation period in from five to three
 
04:54:17.548 --> 04:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
years and eliminating the compensation
 
04:54:20.548 --> 04:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
over base limitation same in all three
 
04:54:20.558 --> 04:54:22.708 align:start position:0%
over base limitation same in all three
bills

04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:54:26.270 --> 04:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay AFC changes to the
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
es DP
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
limitations are in
 
04:54:35.708 --> 04:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
727 they that the limitation which
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
commonly applies to tier a but will
 
04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
apply to the tier BS who hit their
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
vested VI dat that essentially makes
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
them tier a in almost all regards
 
04:54:55.830 --> 04:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
um that definition is taken out of hb2
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
it was it it's something in current
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
law and it's remained in hb2 in 2023 and
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
in HB
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
727 uh but it was taken out of
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
hb2 and therefore for TI would no longer
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
be subject to the limitation that in
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
their High three years their average
 
04:55:20.708 --> 04:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
esdp cannot exceed their High seven
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
years uh since
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
2012 so it's like the coob rule by
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
comparing you know but it's it it and
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
it's been in the law for quite some time
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and it's um effective so you're you're
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that hb2
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
2025 has a change for tier a uh no no
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 2023 and hb2
 
04:55:49.548 --> 04:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
2025 kept the law as it currently is
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
which has this limit on how much special
 
04:55:53.310 --> 04:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
Duty you can have in your high three
 
04:55:58.430 --> 04:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
years okay hb2 2025 took that out yes
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that increases the cost because
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
that limitation is going away yes all
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
right but that's a change not just for
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
tier B but also for tier a yes uh no uh
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes so tier tier a led the limitation
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
too yes yeah okay and it's probably and
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
we think that's a mistake because we
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
don't think the intention was to change
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
tier I don't know about the the intent I
 
04:56:26.430 --> 04:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
was deducing the way the drafting that
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
could have been a mistake maybe right
 
04:56:30.548 --> 04:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to talk to Steve and the
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
governor about whether it was
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
intentional or not understand okay um so
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
the service retirement benefit
 
04:56:39.400 --> 04:56:43.910 align:start position:0%
the service retirement benefit
calculation

04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.920 --> 04:56:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
hb2

04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
04:56:46.680 --> 04:56:50.830 align:start position:0%
hb2
2023

04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.110 --> 04:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
increase um I'm sorry that it's
 
04:57:00.670 --> 04:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
2.5% once someone gets to the arested by
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
date and for anyone who retires before
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's 2.4 to 2.1 to 2.4 under the chart
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
that currently
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
applies hb7 27 is a little bit different
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
because in the interim we passed HB 1647
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
that gave 2 and a half% for over 15
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
years and so this is 2.1 to 2.4 for the
 
04:57:28.190 --> 04:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
first 15 years in in in in in 2.5 after
 
04:57:29.788 --> 04:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
for people who retire before their
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
vested date for the those who who who
 
04:57:35.190 --> 04:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
continue in service until their vested
 
04:57:37.390 --> 04:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
date get the increased benefits the same
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
as under HB 2 and 2023
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
and hb2 2025 is the same as HB 727 so
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
there was no change in the governor's
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill from 727 earlier this year okay uh
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh page three
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
um in the left column you see what the
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.230 --> 04:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
benefit what and it says you know people
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
who commend service prior to 7109
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
and these
 
04:58:12.400 --> 04:58:15.788 align:start position:0%
and these
changes

04:58:15.788 --> 04:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
um have the
 
04:58:20.670 --> 04:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
effect because they changed that cutoff
 
04:58:21.788 --> 04:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
date from
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
7019 to 7101 in hb2 2023 727 used
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
1199 um instead of
 
04:58:36.430 --> 04:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
7101 the difference is from current law
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
is that now applies the maximum benefit
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
to a group of people who it didn't apply
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
to before and that's a cost
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
savings the governor's bill doesn't
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
include that so by comparison the
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
governor's bill has maintains current
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
law and so by comparison to the other
 
04:58:57.548 --> 04:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
two bills that's why that's the other
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
factor that that makes it cost
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
more um now to uh if I'll take any
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions on the substance before we go
 
04:59:09.150 --> 04:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
to the cost if anyone has any questions
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah let's get to page four but it may
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
we may end up going backwards
 
04:59:14.000 --> 04:59:18.150 align:start position:0%
we may end up going backwards
okay

04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
so hb2
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
2023 so what we ask the actuary to do is
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
um give us a
 
04:59:29.310 --> 04:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
number that would be have a neutral
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
effect on the
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
UA okay so these cost estimates are that
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
only it does not include the impact on
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
contribution rates going forward because
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the nature of that calculation and
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the unpredictability of wage growth and
 
04:59:48.510 --> 04:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
other Actuarial factors that is not
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
conducive to bringing it back to a
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
present value because of the uncertainty
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
of the facts whereas dollars you predict
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
the dollars and that they're easy to
 
04:59:59.788 --> 04:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
bring down so th that's a little
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
different um and that's why these we
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't include any comparative impact on
 
05:00:11.548 --> 05:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
the uh com uh member employer rates
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
um so what
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
the what the actuary did is he looked at
 
05:00:16.400 --> 05:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
the what the actuary did is he looked at
HB

05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
2023 and said that uh there wasn't a
 
05:00:25.948 --> 05:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
real material difference in in the um
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
the provisions and therefore he valued
 
05:00:32.430 --> 05:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
it the same as hb2 727 for which we did
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
a full valuation earlier this year so uh
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
and that's just go to the point I should
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
have set up front is we can give you a
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
hard exact number if there's a full
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
valuation the only one we've done it for
 
05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
is 727 hb2 is almost done for 2025 and
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 for 2023 because it was so similar
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
to 727 he said I'm going to use the 727
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
number and I'm going to figure out that
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's $10,300 to pay for it without
 
05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
having increase or decrease in the UA
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
because as you recall the bills proposed
 
05:01:11.230 --> 05:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
27.5 million which would decreased the
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
UA by 98.2 million
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to find a neutal
 
05:01:18.830 --> 05:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
cost that
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's what that number is so
 
05:01:25.628 --> 05:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
when you go to hb2
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
2025 you go why is that 237
 
05:01:35.070 --> 05:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
400 yes that's the cost of the impact of
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
removing the special Duty
 
05:01:41.310 --> 05:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
provision and not changing the maximum
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.430 --> 05:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
statutes that's why that difference is
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
so significant show us the maximum
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
benefit let's go back yeah thank you
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
that's page three page
 
05:01:54.520 --> 05:01:56.070 align:start position:0%
that's page three page
three

05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
so what this means is
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
again because 2023 and hb7
 
05:02:05.400 --> 05:02:07.590 align:start position:0%
again because 2023 and hb7
27

05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
27
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
both changed or proposed to change the
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
cfff date for when the maximum benefit
 
05:02:16.990 --> 05:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
applies by moving it back in
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
time 7101 in one case 11 199 it's now
 
05:02:22.360 --> 05:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
time 7101 in one case 11 199 it's now
subjecting

05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
subjecting
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
members to the maximum benefit who were
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
not are not subject to it under current
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
law and that includes group one as well
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
as group two so that is a big element of
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
the cost differential that's sping no no
 
05:02:43.390 --> 05:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
that's not spiking I don't I don't use
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
the word spiking just I just was
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
repeating you it's a maximum benefit at
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
the end of your care not at the end of
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
your it's a maximum benefit based on in
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
this case current law for people hired
 
05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
05:03:04.110 --> 05:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
7109 it's 100% of their highest year of
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
compensation for people hired on or
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
after 7109 it's 8 5% of average final
 
05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
compensation or
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
$120,000 are we changing the period of
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
which we average from no from five years
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
to three years all this is doing is
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
saying what at what date does it did a
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
member have to be hired in order
 
05:03:34.110 --> 05:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
to be subject to the maximum benefit and
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
by moving that date from 09 to 01 you've
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
got got eight more years of people who
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
are going to be subject to the benefit
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
who aren't currently and that's why
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
there's a cost savings the way I read it
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
in in hb2 language it instead of going
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
back average your highest three or
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
average five years it said your your
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
last year couldn't be more than the year
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
before that which just gets it down to
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
two years of spiking in
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
five I don't recall that in any versions
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
of these so statutes proposals let me
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
restate what you just said and see if
 
05:04:12.030 --> 05:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
you agree okay okay um um So
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently current law says that your
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
final pension cannot be greater than um
 
05:04:25.948 --> 05:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
for most people okay uh your highest
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
year of
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
earnings right um for most people no for
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
people hired before
 
05:04:39.150 --> 05:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
719 so that's people who that's 16 years
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
ago so anyone who started work in the
 
05:04:44.590 --> 05:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
last 16 years is subject to the second
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
maximum which is
 
05:04:50.430 --> 05:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
85% and it's 85% of AFC not highest year
 
05:04:52.830 --> 05:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
of earnable comp so that's that's a
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
limitation built into the that as well
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
okay because you're averaging over five
 
05:05:02.430 --> 05:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
years not Tak just the highest year and
 
05:05:02.440 --> 05:05:04.230 align:start position:0%
years not Tak just the highest year and
it's

05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
$112,000 was the a dollar amount
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
whichever W1 125,000 uh well law is 120
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the proposals would have increased it to
 
05:05:16.590 --> 05:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
125 gotcha so so the numbers are the
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
same in each of these options it's just
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
the change in the cutof date now
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
subjects more people to the maximum
 
05:05:27.070 --> 05:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
benefit Who currently are not subject to
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
it and as compared to the governor's
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill which didn't make those
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
changes these bills cost less oh because
 
05:05:40.750 --> 05:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the savings so you that
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
today these maximums aren't in no
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
they're in but they just apply to fewer
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
people okay and they stay in under the
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
hb2 for this year correct no no I mean
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes so the the the column the where
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
it says you know on on page three the
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
the column all the way on the left
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit provision that is that
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
is what is in hb2 2025 right it's not in
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
either of the other two it's in but with
 
05:06:14.670 --> 05:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
different cut off different provisions
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
and so for the purposes of trying to
 
05:06:19.708 --> 05:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
compare the three
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
bills you have to take that into account
 
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
that these Savings in hp2 AR the result
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
of any deliberate uh changes in the law
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's just maintaining the current
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
law so these so current
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
law has
 
05:06:40.510 --> 05:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
these has or doesn't doesn't have
 
05:06:42.910 --> 05:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
these cut off oh it has a different cut
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
off it has a different maximum has a ma
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
has the same maximum in terms of 100%
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
for one group 85 or 120 for another
 
05:06:52.990 --> 05:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
group it's just that the group is bigger
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
under 2023 in HB 727 because it was
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
moving the hired by date to a back in
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
time so all those people hired between
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
the two dates are now s to a maximum so
 
05:07:08.830 --> 05:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
what those bills were doing was giving
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
the whole group group bigger
 
05:07:16.590 --> 05:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
multipliers but but limiting the top end
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
is that is that applying the limit on
 
05:07:20.590 --> 05:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
the top end to more people to more
 
05:07:23.470 --> 05:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
people and and what the intent of that
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
was I'm not
 
05:07:29.310 --> 05:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
sure okay all right okay but as compared
 
05:07:31.948 --> 05:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
to hb2
 
05:07:34.510 --> 05:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
2025 the other two options are cheaper
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
because hb2 doesn't provide for the
 
05:07:40.150 --> 05:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
change and maintains current law it
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
maintains the size of that group yes but
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's also giving them the bigger
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
multipliers and the other
 
05:07:49.390 --> 05:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
improvements right so that's why it's
 
05:07:52.110 --> 05:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
more more expensive I see yes and so
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
those are the factors that account for
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
the differences in the cost primarily
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
there were other Actuarial factors that
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
that uh so hb2 2023 and HP 20 727
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
2025 were sort of giving on one side but
 
05:08:11.708 --> 05:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
taking away on another
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
side yeah apparently yes I can't speak
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
to what the intent was again but yes
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
effectively this side is limiting a
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
little and that side is being a little
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
more generous right and where you
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
limiting applies to group one also oh
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so does does anything in hb2
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
2025 apply to group one or no no no no
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the only common
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
Pro provision at stake here um that uh
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
is is this um maximum benefit and the
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
changes to the earnable comp but the
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
changes to the earnable comp don't apply
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
to okay TR don't apply well I'm sorry
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not explaining that correctly
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
um the changes to earnable comp are
 
05:09:08.548 --> 05:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
bifurcated just as a definition between
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
now going to be B at
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
between group one and group
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
two the maximum benefit doesn't make a
 
05:09:18.030 --> 05:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
distinction between them okay applies to
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
everyone just a moment so hb2
 
05:09:26.590 --> 05:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
2023 made group one
 
05:09:29.548 --> 05:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
lesser without any improvements to group
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
one because it added this limitation no
 
05:09:34.430 --> 05:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
it makes it no no it changed the
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
limitation so it costs
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
more in other words
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
you've got that same the group of people
 
05:09:44.190 --> 05:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
subject to the maximum is also increased
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
for group one but not in
 
05:09:51.430 --> 05:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
2023 yes 20
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
2023 2023 and and and hb7 27 are the
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
same right so for those two
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
bills group one got hurt is that what
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying no um group more people
 
05:10:07.708 --> 05:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
will be subject to the maximum more
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
people will be subject to the maximum
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
yeah and there was no other Improvement
 
05:10:16.150 --> 05:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
for group one in those bills no right
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay so group one got
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
hurt hurts the subjective term I'm not
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
going to use a lesser benefit or as a
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
group right as a group they got less
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
benefits they got less benefits thank
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
you but I would
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
say yes it's far less common for group
 
05:10:35.070 --> 05:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
ones to hit the maximum benefit because
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
they have the lower multiplier yes yes
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
well this is this is what I'm reading
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
meting that you know I I thought we went
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
to 5 years averaging yes this says um
 
05:10:48.868 --> 05:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
compensation of extra and special Duty
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
as reported by the employer shall be
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
included but limited during the highest
 
05:10:54.990 --> 05:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
three years of credible Service as
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
provided in paragraph 18 however
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation in the final 12
 
05:11:01.868 --> 05:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
months of credible Services prior to
 
05:11:03.750 --> 05:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
termination of employment shall be
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
limited to 1 and 1/ half times the
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
higher of the earnable compensation in
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
the 12 month period preceding the final
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
12 months of the highest compensation is
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
determined for the purpose of
 
05:11:16.990 --> 05:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
calculating average final compensation
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
but excluding the final 12 months any
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
compensation received in the final 12
 
05:11:23.470 --> 05:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
months of employment in excess of such
 
05:11:25.708 --> 05:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
limit shall not be subject to member or
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
employment or employer contribution so
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's still allowing for extra extra yes
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
in your last two years yes instead of
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
your last three so the the instead of of
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
five yeah yeah so it's it's it's going
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
to skew it tremendously two separate R
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
rules okay that that 150% R we refer to
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's been around for years it's
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
completely different it just says if in
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
your final year it's a kind of a
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
companion to some of the other
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions that were designed to limit
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
how much we count at the end of a career
 
05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a different rule it's been
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
around for longer and it just says that
 
05:12:10.830 --> 05:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
if in your final
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
year your earnable compensation is more
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
than 150% of what it was in your
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
penultimate year we're going to only
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
count what you got in your penultimate
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
year okay so that's but you're also
 
05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
subject to the other rules that other
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
than like the cob rule that
 
05:12:36.030 --> 05:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
limits how much Co in your high five
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
against how much C you had on average in
 
05:12:40.910 --> 05:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
your whole career so they're companion
 
05:12:43.150 --> 05:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions but they operate totally
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
differently and so one does not mean the
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
other doesn't exist well it's still
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
allows you to build it up or spike it as
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
my in my term well you could in the
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
penultimate year you you could increase
 
05:12:57.070 --> 05:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
it all right just a moment but that's
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
going to be in your that's going to be
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
in your high three average and it's
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
currently subject to the compensation
 
05:13:07.350 --> 05:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
over base rule yes yes okay um I'm
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
sensing that we're we're at the end of
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
our ability to to to focus on this but I
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
will let representative MS ask the last
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
last question I just wanted to ask about
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
this you know the seven-year um
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
seven-year rule so it looks like if I'm
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly this the
 
05:13:29.350 --> 05:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
seven-year rule on extra special duty
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
pay was
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
implemented in
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
2011 um previous to that there was no
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
such rule it looks like there's some
 
05:13:45.628 --> 05:13:45.638 align:start position:0%
confusion as to whether the governor has
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated that rule or left that rule
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
in place um and it and based on your I
 
05:13:55.788 --> 05:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
guess that that' be my first question is
 
05:13:58.590 --> 05:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
that is that your I mean you've given us
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
two cost estimates one with the
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
seven-year Rule and one without so I'm
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
assuming there's some confusion there so
 
05:14:07.708 --> 05:14:07.718 align:start position:0%
well I just wanted to point out because
 
05:14:11.070 --> 05:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if if was intentional okay
 
05:14:13.868 --> 05:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
because this provision was in one part
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the the current law that addresses
 
05:14:19.868 --> 05:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
group one yeah uh I I
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
mean it was taken out of one section of
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
Law and it was it and it could have been
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
mistakenly or intentionally not included
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
in the new definition that applies
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson is shaking his
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
head saying that it was intentional um
 
05:14:39.070 --> 05:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and so so if that's the case then
 
05:14:39.080 --> 05:14:40.990 align:start position:0%
yeah and so so if that's the case then
the

05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:46.390 --> 05:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
2374 100 the 237 million dollar number
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
is the number that is reflective of
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
governor's right so taking that out um
 
05:14:56.670 --> 05:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
is the difference between 2374 and 19
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
1946 so it's $43 million to take it
 
05:15:04.350 --> 05:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
out thank you all right we will be back
 
05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
here on uh Monday at 10: is that right
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
was how much work are you doing over the
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
weekend a lot okay so you might answer
 
05:15:18.350 --> 05:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
an email or
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
two all right good well I will be doing

for

05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.840 --> 05:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
