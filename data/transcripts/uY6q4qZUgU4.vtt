00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury and um i
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
sent you i got way ahead of myself to
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
send you some written testimony um
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
a few days ago probably so long ago
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
you've all probably already read it and
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
forgotten about it
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
and um i was uh so i'm certainly
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of itla spell i think it's uh
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
he's i think it's a bad idea i do feel a
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
little bit sympathetic towards dr olsen
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
the finder of it because our backgrounds
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
are somewhere i have a uh
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
finally went as far as a masters by
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
masters in um
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
english comparative literature from
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
columbia university and he managed to uh
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
stick it out for doctorate um
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
and you know i think in medieval
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
literature so
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
certainly hats off to that he certainly
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
is a uh he must be a brilliant guy
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
to have done all that and it is an
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
interesting uh
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
enterprise but i don't think it's really
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
a university or that it should be
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
granted degree
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh granting a status so he's failed to
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate his degrees are worth
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
anything and it's also unclear if it's
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
making any progress
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
towards becoming accredited or to
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
qualifying for federal student loan
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
programs he does uh
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
website says let's say something about
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
how they have their own financing set up
 
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.270 align:start position:0%
how they have their own financing set up
but

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh it would be better to do it through
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
program which offers a lot more
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
protections to both the lender and the
 
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.469 align:start position:0%
protections to both the lender and the
borrower

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
borrower
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
it has um i understand it doesn't need a
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
campus and campuses are very expensive
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
because it's offering all the classes
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
online but it's only
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
physical nexus it's a private mailbox at
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
the ups store the strip mall
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
in nashua excuse me university needs
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
more of a uh
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
physical presence than that or actually
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
they have to discover they have like a
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
second mailbox at the second upstart
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
bedford but that
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
kind of makes it seem even more
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
substantial if they have multiple
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
mailboxes um i was also troubled uh
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
dr olson the founder was publicly
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
threatening a member of this committee
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
apparently because he
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
didn't like a committee report with
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
take place in the house calendar in 2019
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
i saw nothing wrong with the committee
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
report and even if it was that's not
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
really the proper way
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
for dr johnson to disagree with the
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee report um
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then they've also already been
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
advertising and actively offering a
 
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
advertising and actively offering a
master's

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
master's
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
of arts degree which requires some
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
legislature and the
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh department of education have not yet
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
granted an authority to uh to offer and
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
of course it's not accredited too so
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
even at the previous hearing this
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the other bill hb 513 the
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
reason the lumber stepped forward and
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
she had used her degree to get a job at
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
a local community college and
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
yeah she uh you know she just said
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
flatly said she had a master's degree
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
from cigna man of course that
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
really didn't exist yet they weren't
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
authorized to offer events she appeared
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
far as i could tell dedicated and
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
skilled educator but
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a lot of potential for
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
abuse if you have an organization
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
offering you know what are basically uh
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
fictitious uh graduate degrees
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
and um um and uh
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
also here's dr olson he's operating
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
obviously fair use allows
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
him to use a tolkien estate's uh
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
copyright for for educational use but
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
he's describing himself as the
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
tokyo professor he has um well not
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
really the degree of course his broad
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
arrangement but he has
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
other courses he offers which are
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
entirely about tolkien's work and
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
although he doesn't need his permission
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
that seems a little uh
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
misleading i think he's crossed rather
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
blurry lines so i certainly um
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
certainly think it's an interesting
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
enterprise i just don't
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
think it's at the point yet where we
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
should call the university or where
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire should be
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
authorizing it to offer degrees so um
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
so even though he's a fellow columbia
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
man i'm going to recommend that you uh
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
find sp 19 and expedia to legislate
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
first notwithstanding the fact we've
 
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
first notwithstanding the fact we've
already

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
house has already passed the other bill
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
which is on its way to the senate later
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
today but
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm so not sure what would affect an itl
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
would happen i urge you to uh urge you
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
to correct the mistake we made last time
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
and find sb 19 and expedia to legislate
 
00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
and find sb 19 and expedia to legislate
so

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
thanks very much i guess i'd be happy to
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
explain something to me because i don't
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
understand um
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
why why is sb 19 and
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
bills that we've already had and gone
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
over came back which doesn't appear to
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
be any major change there's a reason or
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand the process so
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
what's your question please explain that
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
real quick i'm trying to understand
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
learn the process i don't understand why
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
a senate bill is very similar to what we
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's required by by their rules our
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
rules and by law every
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
every bill has to be heard within our
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
body unless it doesn't get to us it
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
came out of there out of that uh body
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
was not passed okay so this is
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
this is a separate okay so it's
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
understanding this like
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
the second bill the same thing that's
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's a second bill just like we've had
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
second bills on numerous
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh legislation even this year that are
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the house side
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
and the senate side okay play god
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay so we're going to
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
open up now the hearing for
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
oh you skipped me out we're not supposed
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%

trying to get out of here today so we're
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
going to hang loose here
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.839 --> 00:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
yeah to answer your question for the
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
snow before

oh yeah we're three inches down from our
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
average over here so
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the wells are going to be tough and
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
stuff i mean the river's already open
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
next to me i should use it i stopped for
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
another two or three weeks
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%

they still get some good some high
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
elevation stuff is still good yeah yeah
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
but pretty much everything's closed down
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
now they're not making obviously anymore
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%

eligibility with
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
what's already in statute and rule for a

currently a cte teacher is not required
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
to have a bachelor's degree for example
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
a welding
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
teacher or a mechanic teacher auto

the one-year certificate of eligibility
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
as it currently
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
is the law prohibits districts
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
from using this
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
kind of emergency situation certificate
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
to fill
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
a position by changing
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
the law to drop the bachelor's
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
requirement just for the cte specialty

area teachers
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
this would allow districts to build
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know their gaps or their needs for
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%

which is the community of uh wolfeboro
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately senator bradley is tied up
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
with a southern obligation
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%

legislation uh sb 24 came over from the
 
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.150 align:start position:0%
legislation uh sb 24 came over from the
senate

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh with a unanimous ought to pass in
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
committee of uh 5-0
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
and a vote of 23-1 uh in the in this
 
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.630 align:start position:0%
and a vote of 23-1 uh in the in this
session

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
um this bill was filed last year in 2020
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
but was one of the bills that was
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a large anonymous bill
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
hb1234 and did not survive the whole
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislative process uh
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
due to covert what this bill simply does
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
it amends the childhood booster academy
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
so they can make changes to the chatter
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
in accordance with provisions of rsa 292
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
colon 7.
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
it also increases the membership of
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
booster academy's board of trustees
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
at the present time booster academy must
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
come before the legislature
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
to make any changes to the charter and
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
that seems kind of unreasonable uh
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
where we are in our you know uh system
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%

sb 24 which would amend um it would

allow brewster academy to amend their
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%

trustees they have on their board
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
important issue in our community so then
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%

uh simple amendments to their charter
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
they would be able to demand their
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
charter like a number of other private
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%

we're proud to serve a truly diverse
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
population by every definition of the
 
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:50.789 align:start position:0%
population by every definition of the
word

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%

ethnically socioeconomically and
cognitively

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
cognitively
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
brewster has an exceptional board of
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
trustees it's a forward-thinking group
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
including two current parents ten former
 
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.109 align:start position:0%
including two current parents ten former
parents

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
four alumni two grandparents and four
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
friends of the school
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
our trustees have really impressive
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
backgrounds they're recognized leaders
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
in their fields
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and they all actively contribute their
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
expertise in service to brewster
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
so while the work of the board has been
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
outstanding there are
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
some composition issues that we're
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
hoping to address with this bill
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
first brewster would like to expand the
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
size of the board from 25 to 30 members
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
as we continue to expand our range of
 
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
as we continue to expand our range of
programs

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
including some new global programs we'd
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
like to further add to the range of
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
skill sets on our board
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
we have run up against the 25 member
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
threshold in the past
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
and we want to ensure that we don't have
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
to turn away any potential trustees who
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
can contribute to our mission and our
 
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.349 align:start position:0%
can contribute to our mission and our
vision

01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
vision
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
we'd also like to eliminate the position
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
held by a representative of the alumni
 
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.150 align:start position:0%
held by a representative of the alumni
association

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
the alumni association it's is no longer
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
active in a formal traditional sense
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh but we do have four alumni on our
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
board currently and
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to actively seek
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
alumni who represent a range of
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
viewpoints and graduation years and
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
finally we are requesting that the
 
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
finally we are requesting that the
legislature

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
grant permission for brewster's board of
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
trustees to manage future amendments to
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
its charter
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
rather than approach the legislature
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
every time that a change is needed
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
the academy would like to take the same
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
approach that was taken by dartmouth
 
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
approach that was taken by dartmouth
college

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
in 2003 and by pinkerton academy in 2011
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
in hopes of you know avoiding using your
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
valuable time
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
for amendments such as board size and
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
composition in the future
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
so thank you again to senator bradley

academy to
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
make those changes rather than have to
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%

our discuss senate bill 135
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
this is an act relative to the
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
and the bill is going to be presented by
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
senator aaron hennessey
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
welcome erin good morning everybody
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
i am erin hennessey i am center for
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
district one and that covers thornton
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
all the way through pittsburgh
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce senate bill 135
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is fix some
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
unforeseen challenges that our schools
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
have had with
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic i'm sure
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
you've all heard from your
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
your uh superintendents that they are
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with the funding formula for
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
next year because of drops in their
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
average daily membership that they've
 
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
average daily membership that they've
seen

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
in addition they've had a difficult time
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting back free and reduced lunch
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
forms from parents or guardians
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
and both of these have an impact on next
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
year's school funding
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is says if a
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
school for some reason
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see a drop in average daily
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
membership and was able to get back
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
their school forms
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and will and the calculation for the
 
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.149 align:start position:0%
and will and the calculation for the
funding

01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
is that they'll get more than this year
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
next year they'll get that
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
but if for some reason they've seen a
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
drop uh in
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
in their attendance because of kovid and
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they they
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
have not received back theirs their free
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch forms
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
they will receive the higher of the
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
calculation for next year
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
or the funding that they've received
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh it has a fiscal impact of
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 45 million dollars
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
and as we are looking at the federal
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
requirements coming into the state
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the uh funding that the um
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
the approximately one billion dollars
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to receive but
 
01:20:09.199 --> 01:20:09.669 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to receive but
also

01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
extra funds that are going directly to
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
some of the requirements are we are
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
requiring a maintenance of effort
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the state must fund the 22 23
 
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
that the state must fund the 22 23
school

01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
school years proportional to those the
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
spending that they've done
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
2017 through 2019 so this bill is very
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
important in that we
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
need to increase the school funding for
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be proportional to what we've done in
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions otherwise
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
someone from the department of education
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
can answer all your difficult questions
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%

01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135. um i i certainly i
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
certainly support the um
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh what your uh what what the intention
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
on this but my my the question i have
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
is i wonder if you could sort of break
 
01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
is i wonder if you could sort of break
down

01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
the um the 45 million dollar price tag
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
the um the adma factor
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh is there a um a cost
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
index factor um uh with this as well
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
a cost index factor do you mean um the
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
inflationary factor that usually goes
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
into the funding formula
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
no this is yeah well this is um
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is the formula the state uses
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
for next year using this um
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
last year's student numbers so if the
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the for the cost the inflationary factor
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
is in the formula
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
then yes it stays in there okay thank
 
01:21:55.679 --> 01:21:57.350 align:start position:0%

he did work at the lba we're very lucky
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
to have him here now at the department
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
but that's why he looks familiar
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
i mean he's helping us in the office of
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
school finance
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill one thing i actually do
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to bring up
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
before i take any questions is the
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
department has
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
asked for an amendment to this bill we
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
had sort of an
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
aha in the middle of the night moment
 
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
aha in the middle of the night moment
about

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
assessments um and we realized that this
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill references the assessment
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
of the previous year in 1920 like all of
 
01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:01.030 align:start position:0%
of the previous year in 1920 like all of
the

01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
rest of the data however there was not
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
an assessment that was implemented
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
in 1920 that has comprehensive
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
assessment results to be used for the
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of third grade reading and
 
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
purpose of third grade reading and
adequacy

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
so we would in fact actually to have an
 
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:15.590 align:start position:0%
so we would in fact actually to have an
accurate

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
number need to refer back to the 18 and
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
19 assessment data
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we did ask for that amendment we
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
realized it yesterday and we sent it
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
over to representative vlad i'm not sure
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
if you were able to
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
get that figured out or not but that was
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
just something that we realized so
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
um given that um we'll take any
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions i think mark is going to
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%

as a separate piece of legislation i
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
would ask you and your colleagues to

01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
shortfall in education aid into the
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
house's version
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal 2223 budget
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know this committee is obviously
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
well familiar with the fact that
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
two of the key determinants of the
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
amount of state education aid
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
are the number of students community
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
service generally as well as the
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
number of low-income students in that
 
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.229 align:start position:0%
number of low-income students in that
community

01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
critically the vast majority of
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
districts in new hampshire have seen
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers decline
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic just to put
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
specific numbers to it
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
the department of education's november
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
15th estimates
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh attendance will decline
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
by about four percent
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
um over the past year uh while certainly
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
the long-term trend has been towards
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
a four percent drop is particularly
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
steep uh those estimates also point to a
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 24
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
decrease in the count of free and
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch students
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh those figures obviously fluctuate
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
from year to year
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
but during times of economic hardship
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
like that like those engendered by the
 
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.390 align:start position:0%
like that like those engendered by the
pandemic

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
you'd expect those numbers to rise not
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
fall and those numbers are
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to rebound as the
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic wanes
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
and as schools resume in-person classes
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the coming year
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
um to an even greater extent than they
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
do already
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
but because of as you know the time lag
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the formula
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
barring necessary changes in law those
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
temporary lower student counts
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
will be used to decide the amount of
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
state aid districts receive in 2122
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
as senator hennessey discussed senate
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
bill 135 recognizes
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the accounts we're seeing now
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
aren't likely to reflect the situation
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
schools will face this fall and comes up
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
with an alternative using the higher of
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um districts or towns uh adma
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
over the past two years to calculate the
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
state education aid
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so certainly while passage of this
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill is vital
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
the bill could be made strong or small
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
in order to preserve the progress that
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature made in the current
 
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.470 align:start position:0%
the legislature made in the current
budget

01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
in bolstering state education aid and
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
targeting it to those cities and towns
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
most in need
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
the budget agreement reached in the fall
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
of 2019 added two elements to new
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's funding formula for fiscal
 
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire's funding formula for fiscal
21

01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
additional aid designed to assist cities
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
and towns with higher
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
of low-income students and fiscal
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity aid
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
which is designed to help municipalities
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
with comparatively low property values
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
given that the inequities that these two
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
types of aid were designed to address
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be just as severe in the
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
coming biennium
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
as they are in the current one i would
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to amend senate bill
 
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to amend senate bill
135

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
135
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
to extend these two forms of aid for
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
now certainly passage of senate bill 135
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
in its present form or an amended form
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
would reduce the need for the potential
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
scale of changes like
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
um spending reductions in local schools
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
or higher property tax increases
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
and obviously municipalities are already
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
grappling um
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
with those decisions many have made
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
those decisions but they do have the
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
authority under current law
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
under rsa 197 3a
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
to revisit those decisions should
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
additional state education aid become
 
01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:16.629 align:start position:0%
additional state education aid become
available

01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh so i would just ask you know and
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
point out that it's imperative
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the legislature send a clear signal
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
to all municipalities as quickly as
 
01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.629 align:start position:0%
to all municipalities as quickly as
possible

01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
so that they can ready themselves for
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
these meetings and reconsider these
 
01:31:27.679 --> 01:31:28.629 align:start position:0%
these meetings and reconsider these
decisions

01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
before the school uh year gets underway
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
the kobet 19 pandemic has tragically
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
taken the lives of more than a thousand
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
disrupted the new hampshire economy and
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
up ended our daily lives in
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
ways large and small we shouldn't allow
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
it to continue to have adverse
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
consequences for our schools
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the children and families they serve
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
so once again i urge the committee to
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
strengthen senate bill 135
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
to recommend it as optipass and to do so
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
as expeditiously as possible
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with all of you
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
to try to address these pressing issues
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to try to answer any
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
questions you might have thank you
 
01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
questions you might have thank you
questions

01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i have one question and i'll just
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
open it up to the committee
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
could you please go into a little bit
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
our attendance is down four percent but
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
the 24
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
decrease in freedom redundancy reduced
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
numbers could you
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
explain that a little bit more please
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so um in some ways the
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
that reduction is a good thing and by
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
which i mean
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
the reason that that 24 reduction is
 
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:33.910 align:start position:0%
the reason that that 24 reduction is
happening

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
is that the federal government in
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
response to the pandemic
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
took steps to make it easier for
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
families to obtain needed food
 
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.270 align:start position:0%
families to obtain needed food
assistance

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
they waive the requirement that people
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
complete the food work that excuse me
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
the paperwork necessary
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
to receive food assistance and are in
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
essence providing free lunches to
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
everyone who may want it
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
however the downside of that is that
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
that paperwork
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
was is what the state uses to arrive at
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
its counts for free and reduced price
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
lunch students
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
and those counts in turn are
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the adequacy aid
 
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.510 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the adequacy aid
formula

01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't filling out that
 
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:10.950 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't filling out that
paperwork

01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
and districts have gone in some lengths
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
to try to get them to do so
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
they're not going to show up in those
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
counts but once the federal government
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
ends this program
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
people are still going to be in need and
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to begin completing that
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork once again
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
so you'll see a very rapid uptick in
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
those counts
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
but because of the lag in the formula um
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know those kids will still be there
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
and need to be served
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
but will have suppressed aid as a result
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
of this change
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i have one one follow-up to what
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
spoke to um so schools that have the
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
freedom to use they'll have frankly
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
these programs within it
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
are they providing the free do this
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
program to all students
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
at low-cost students uh are they doing
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
any paperwork during this pandemic
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh i would defer to uh staff from the
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
department of education about the
 
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
department of education about the
delivery

01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the paperwork i do know you know
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
based on prior testimony and other
 
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.310 align:start position:0%
based on prior testimony and other
hearings

01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
that there have been some communities
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
that have you know gone to great lengths
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
to try to get
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
this paperwork completed um and there
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
are others that just simply done with
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
the capacity so there may be varying
 
01:34:16.719 --> 01:34:17.430 align:start position:0%
the capacity so there may be varying
efforts

01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
but i think even in places where they
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
have tried to make the effort
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the take-up is still relatively you
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
completion rate is still relatively low
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
are there questions for mr mcclinch
 
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
are there questions for mr mcclinch
representative

01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
you very much uh mr mick lynch for
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could um um talk
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
with us a little bit about the
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
connection between
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
um concentrations of
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
students and families with in lower
 
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:50.470 align:start position:0%
students and families with in lower
socioeconomic

01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
with lower socioeconomic means and the
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
sort of expected costs that a school
 
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.790 align:start position:0%
sort of expected costs that a school
district

01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
would uh would incur for uh for
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
educating its students
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um you know there is a
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
very direct connection
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
in that uh lower income students tend to
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
greater needs and therefore uh schools
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
need greater resources to address them
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
the current formula
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
um you know recognizes that in in
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
installing the free and reduced price
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
launch accounts in there
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
um you know i will say that i touched
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
upon sort of existing inequities
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
as it relates to these issues the
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study school funding as
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
you well know uh looked at these issues
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
at some length over the past
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
year and the conclusion that they
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
arrived at is that um
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know the current system is
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
inequitable from both a student and
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer perspective and just to quote
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
their report
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
the districts serving the highest
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
proportion of students who are
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged spend less on
 
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:49.830 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged spend less on
average

01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
compared with districts serving the
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
fewest that students moreover districts
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
with the least property wealth per
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
student imposed the highest local
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
education tax rates
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund their children's
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
education so given that there's
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
certainly a need to continue with
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
additional aid and fiscal capacity
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
disparity aid until
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
longer term reforms are put in place
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
and then a follow up on that mr chair
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much and um
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
and and thanks again for for for
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
answering that
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could also sort
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
of extend that analysis
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
towards um towards really the the the
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
student equity
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
um you know element of um of
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
how well these students in you know that
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
higher concentrations of of uh or
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
i should say student students aware let
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
me say it another way
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
districts where there are higher
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
concentrations of of
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
low-income families and how that
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
reflects upon
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
student performance yeah i think there's
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
a direct
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
relationship between those two and again
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to sort of provide
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
um reference to the commission's uh
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
study report i don't have it at hand
 
01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
study report i don't have it at hand
here

01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
but i looked at that very question i
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
believe and you know established
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
or sort of underscored the fact that
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
the student the districts that tend to
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
spend less tend to have students who are
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
having trouble performing even though
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
there is that greater need
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh for uh
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
mr mcclinch i might add
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
that in follow-up to the question you
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
just asked absolutely
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
we know with those communities that have
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
a property level
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
a property valuation of 660 000
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
or less we have 85 percent of the
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
students in those districts
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
are functioning and quartile one or two
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
of the proficiency tests
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
where we have then 15
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
in three and four that's above the
 
01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.430 align:start position:0%
in three and four that's above the
bottom

01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a direct relationship between
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know the device property valuation
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
which is also associated often times
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
with poverty
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
um pre-reduced counts there is a real
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
good correlation here between
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
already any other questions for mr mc
 
01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
already any other questions for mr mc
lynch

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much john thank you
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
sorry next we have leslie want and i've
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
i hope she'll be here in a minute i i am
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
here hello
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
oh good okay welcome to education
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
oh thanks thank you so much it was
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
was not easy to find not easy to find
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
this link this morning for some reason
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
but anyway you know that i believe
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time hearing here in
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
that video
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay um maybe if i just put my mouth a
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
little closer does that help at all
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit better okay um i
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
know too that dr goldhart i believe it
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
is also in
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
and would like to speak at some point he
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
he's our superintendent here in
 
01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:27.189 align:start position:0%
he's our superintendent here in
manchester

01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm the vice chair here in the at
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the manchester city school district
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um we are strongly in support of
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill 135
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
um our district will lose a great deal
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
if we use the attendance numbers from
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
this year as opposed to using them from
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of the previous two years
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
so we are strongly in support of this we
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
stand too right now
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the attic the reduction adequacy
 
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.590 align:start position:0%
with the attic the reduction adequacy
aid

01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're having fewer students standalones
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars here in manchester
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
and as you all know in manchester we
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
have some of the neediest students
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the state with our high numbers of
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
pre-reduced lunch students and high
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
numbers of students that are
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the el population we also stand to
 
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.229 align:start position:0%
in the el population we also stand to
lose

01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
four million dollars in uh reduced aid
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
from our pre-reduced lunch so that's
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
also something we're hoping the senate
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
will consider
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
um fixing for next year but i would also
 
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
um fixing for next year but i would also
ask

01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
if possible if you can uh promote dr
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
goldhart to speak um
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'd be interested in hearing
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
what he had to say okay yes he's on my
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
list i can
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
i can promote him if that's okay uh
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative ladd
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you very much you're
 
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.550 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you very much you're
welcome

01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
okay good morning mr goldhard
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me i just want to
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate as the superintendent of our
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
largest school district the positive
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
impact this bill would have for us
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have a great number of students who
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
do qualify
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
for free reduced lunch but due to the
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
current situation where
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
everybody is pretty much qualified
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to get those
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
applications back
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
but we know the students are still here
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
and our enrollment has dropped this year
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
however most of that enrollment drop was
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten in first grade
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we think many of these students will
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
return next year
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
when we're back to it we hope a more
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
normal year
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i like this bill because it helps
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
districts like
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
us be held harmless and as vice chair
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
want had shared
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
we have very high needs students
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
and these funds make a dramatic impact
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
because we know
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
title one funds will be cut for us
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
the free reduced lunch numbers and so
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
this will help us
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
a lot and i appreciate this bill
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the the effort that has been put
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
into it to help districts like ours
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can serve our students in our
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
be in the best way possible so we
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
strongly support it
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh john uh
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question um can you
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
i wish i could explain where all of them
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
have gone
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh the problem is is with kindergarten
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know where they were to start
 
01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:38.709 align:start position:0%
we don't know where they were to start
with

01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
but when we look at the numbers that had
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
drop where our normal numbers for
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten were
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
much lower than they've been every year
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i know we didn't have a
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
that big of a drop in births that year
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i think there was a lot of concern
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
about having kids in school because of
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
covert now i do know our enrollment is
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
dropping just like the whole state
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is true but it is not
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
this the high number that we've had this
 
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:11.910 align:start position:0%
this the high number that we've had this
year

01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.270 align:start position:0%
year
[Music]

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.189 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
questions

01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for very much mr chair and uh
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh dr goldhart for joining us this
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
morning it's great to see you again
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i hadn't even connected the um
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the fact of
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
of a reduction in free and reduced price
 
01:43:36.639 --> 01:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
of a reduction in free and reduced price
lunch

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
and uh receipt of federal title 1 funds
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you could sort of
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about that
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
how that affects manchester and and
 
01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
how that affects manchester and and
maybe

01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i know it's hard to sort of
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
calculate but but
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
how how that could be projected as a as
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
a statewide loss in
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
federal dollars to support public
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
education yeah i don't have the exact
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
figures for me the title one but it is
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
dramatic for us because it's based upon
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
free reduced lunch and because we don't
 
01:44:09.119 --> 01:44:09.510 align:start position:0%
free reduced lunch and because we don't
have

01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
those total numbers like we've had
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
before our title 1 funds are going to
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
drop by at least 40 or 50 percent or
 
01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
drop by at least 40 or 50 percent or
more

01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
this next year for us and my guess is
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
other districts will have
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
dramatic losses as well because the free
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch numbers
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
are not the same and this will hurt us
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
a lot and so what you're doing is going
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
to help us dramatically and then we hope
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
by the next year
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
when we can get those free reduced
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
numbers where they
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
should be then the title one funds will
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
come back but yes on the federal side
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
there will be a drop
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow up on that mr chair yeah and and
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you could just sort of refresh
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory how how districts use
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
title 1 funds
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're used in multiple ways we use
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
them for additional
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
instructors we use them for additional
 
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.149 align:start position:0%
instructors we use them for additional
materials

01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
materials
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
we use them for additional professional
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
learning for schools that are title one
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
we use them for additional
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
other supports but the most the most of
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
the cost is in additional instruction
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
and additional material
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%

yeah i've been an administrator and i
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
know how title one runs are so important
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
to a school district especially for
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
healthy remedial situations
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me one
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
i asked this question of another
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
individual regarding the
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
free and reduced uh meal applications
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i know of some districts that just
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
have provided free meals to everybody
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
you've indicated you're down a
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
significant percentage here
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
um did you get any applications back or
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you tried to get applications
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
and um it's i know there's a real
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
issue uh i just like know whether you
 
01:46:12.159 --> 01:46:12.550 align:start position:0%
issue uh i just like know whether you
were

01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
we still were probably required to get
 
01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:16.070 align:start position:0%
we still were probably required to get
these

01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
applications out and or were you
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
given the latitude by the uh by the
 
01:46:22.239 --> 01:46:22.629 align:start position:0%
given the latitude by the uh by the
state

01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
or the feds that uh that you didn't have
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
the latitude was continued for the rest
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the year to provide it for all
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
but we've continued to reach out to get
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
applications we're not stopping
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh the problem has been we're not
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
getting them back even though we've
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
tried in multiple methods
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we're getting people to take
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of the lunches
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
but we know they qualify but we need the
 
01:46:48.639 --> 01:46:49.830 align:start position:0%
but we know they qualify but we need the
paperwork

01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we're we're still trying
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair i'm
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
not sure whether this question
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
is to dr goldhart or to our
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative from the department
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
but this uh issue of um
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
knowing where these students are and
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch is not just
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
within this state
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government may have some
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
understanding or feedback of this
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
problem has there been
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
any uh note from the federal government
 
01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
any uh note from the federal government
regarding

01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
latitude in dealing with this topic
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
since it's obviously all over the
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
country not just in this state
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
i know our board sent a letter to our
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
on this very issue and then my national
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
association the national association for
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents has been lobbying as
 
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
well at the federal level
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
because it is a national issue where all
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
districts across the country
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
are going to have title 1 reductions
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
this year because of this exact problem
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
mark have you heard anything from the
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
feds on this
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you for the question uh
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
just recently i think like a week or two
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
ago the feds announced
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
um for the title programs within the
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
department of education we can use
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
the best available fnr data so they gave
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
us flexibility to fix this problem on
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
the federal funding side for schools
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
but um you're right it's it is a
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
national issue um
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
sp 30 sb 135 seeks to fix it for the
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state issue as far as how it's
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
impacting adequacy but the federal
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
issue for the title programs have been
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
has been resolved at this moment
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow that question up that
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative had
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is a serious issue for all
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
public schools throughout the country i
 
01:48:43.119 --> 01:48:44.070 align:start position:0%
public schools throughout the country i
have

01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
four grandchildren across the river in
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
vermont and
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
they have not had to pay for meals this
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
year they've been provided by the school
 
01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
year they've been provided by the school
district

01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
all kids are receiving it over there uh
 
01:48:55.119 --> 01:48:55.750 align:start position:0%
all kids are receiving it over there uh
so

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
how's that going to impact their title
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
one month
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
is it just that the feds are going to
 
01:49:02.590 --> 01:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
allow us to go back to like
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
1819 of those uh that that year or 1920
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
where which one we have to go to so my
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is they've given
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility so uh best available data so
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
the best available data
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
the the 2019 2020 data should be pretty
 
01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:19.189 align:start position:0%
the the 2019 2020 data should be pretty
good

01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
um it depends on how vermont manages
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
their data systems
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
but um vermont should have the same
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility that new hampshire has as
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
the federal program
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
for the superintendent from manchester
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%

uh so i'm very familiar with school
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
budgets uh
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
primarily for the city of berlin i urge
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
you to support
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135 along with its
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh proposed amendments that you will
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
soon hear 10 12 and 10
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
20. currently we have
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
crippling school budgets in the north
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
country school districts namely berlin
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
groveton colebrook white mountain and
 
01:51:12.159 --> 01:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
groveton colebrook white mountain and
others

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
it is critical for school operations to
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
have the fiscal disparity aid
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
and as well as additional aid for free
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
and reduced
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
accounts in the next biennium berlin has
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
closed three buildings in my tenure
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
due in part to enrollment and in part to
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
financial capital
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
so a couple of years back the berlin
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
school board initiated a solve education
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
funding campaign
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
because we're in such dire straits and
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
yet that's
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been really seen by the
 
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
hasn't been really seen by the
legislature

01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is you need to
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
understand that the city of berlin has
 
01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:51.669 align:start position:0%
understand that the city of berlin has
about

01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
32 to 35 percent of taxable property
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the city of berlin which leaves an
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
estimated 65 percent of the city of
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
berlin is tax-exempt
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
because of prisons federal and state
 
01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.430 align:start position:0%
because of prisons federal and state
buildings

01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
so you really can't raise the revenue i
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
currently pay
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
39.52 cents per thousand
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 the district closed the last
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
and had to eliminate a korean technical
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
education administrator
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
position because we just did not raise
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
how can students have equitable
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities when there's no capacity
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
or adapt to the new hampshire workforce
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
with our students
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
please take a close look at the local
 
01:52:37.199 --> 01:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
please take a close look at the local
communities

01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
and their capacity to raise local
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
based on the property within that
 
01:52:44.239 --> 01:52:45.990 align:start position:0%
based on the property within that
community

01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
by not approving or amending senate bill
 
01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:49.270 align:start position:0%
by not approving or amending senate bill
135

01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
135
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
and the amendments i believe you're
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
declaring it's okay for inequitable
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
and if you know me um i've fought for
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
this equity
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
um for quite a few years now and it
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
really gets discouraging
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime while people are
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
waiting and studying this
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
issue um things become worse and worse
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
um i had the pleasure of serving on the
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
school funding commission
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
which uh really has data and research
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
that should be invaluable to the state
 
01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.629 align:start position:0%
that should be invaluable to the state
legislators

01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
on how to make our public schools
 
01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.070 align:start position:0%
on how to make our public schools
equitable

01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%

you um
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%

and um as it as it stands right now
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
um my understanding based on your your
 
01:55:18.239 --> 01:55:19.350 align:start position:0%
um my understanding based on your your
testimony

01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that without the amendments this
 
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
is that without the amendments this
doesn't

01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
make school districts whole to the
 
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.709 align:start position:0%
make school districts whole to the
current

01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
um state funding that this really only
 
01:55:30.719 --> 01:55:31.350 align:start position:0%
um state funding that this really only
brings

01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
brings
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
brings you know makes makes them whole
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
to sort of like funding from two years
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
ago by
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
by at least looking at um
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
at at uh pre-pandemic uh enrollment
 
01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
at at uh pre-pandemic uh enrollment
levels

01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
but it it does not have the um the
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
the two equitable grants that does not
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
include the two up
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
equitable grants i think you were
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
referring to for
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
um for um low property valuation
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
and for um for student equity with
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
through free and reduced price lunch
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes that is correct because you got
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
to understand i mean two years ago
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of salaries materials
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
and programs was you know
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago and so now you're talking
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
without the additional aid to increase
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
for cost increases of expenses you've
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
got to lay off staff to be able to make
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
up the difference to operate
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
less than you did two years ago because
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
the funding has not kept up with the
 
01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.669 align:start position:0%
the funding has not kept up with the
cost

01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:37.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
question

01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh that have been pretty eloquently put
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
forth by
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh jeff mc lynch and reiterated uh with
 
01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.470 align:start position:0%
uh jeff mc lynch and reiterated uh with
the

01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
testimony of john and corrine um
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
this disparity aid and um
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
the holding harmless provision due to
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
the loss of funds
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
by free and reduced lunch is so critical
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
to our most struggling communities and
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
we really support
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
sb 135 as the proposed amendments
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
the most struggling communities and most
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
struggling students are the ones who
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
will benefit
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
the most from a positive action on this
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and so uh we encourage its
 
01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.070 align:start position:0%
legislation and so uh we encourage its
support

01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe that
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
there'll be plenty of information shared
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward regarding to
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
specific impacts of specific communities
 
01:58:55.119 --> 01:58:55.910 align:start position:0%
specific impacts of specific communities
but

01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
this loss of revenue for school
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
districts is dramatic in
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
those communities that need it most and
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
those communities that need it most and
so

01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
again we appreciate the sponsors support
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
and would really appreciate the support
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
in moving the amended piece of
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislation forward
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for mr
 
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:21.350 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for mr
fruit

01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
jerry i have one question for you uh
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
or i was last year of the year before
 
01:59:27.599 --> 01:59:28.470 align:start position:0%
or i was last year of the year before
that

01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
the national school boards association
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
put out an
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
advisory to school regarding
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
the use of pre-reduced additional aid
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the physical capacity disparity
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
exchange known as
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
a one-time deal and
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
to invest your knowledge have most
 
01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:48.709 align:start position:0%
to invest your knowledge have most
districts

01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
use that this money for one-time
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
issues or have they had to use this
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
money for
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
long-term you long-term contract or
 
01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.070 align:start position:0%
long-term you long-term contract or
other

02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
lease type issues thank you for the
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
without having specific knowledge i
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
would generally say
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
that districts have used that one-time
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
money in a one-time
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
fashion uh and following that advice
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously none of us
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
a year ago could see what was happening
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
or when that when the school board's
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
association put that
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
memo out what the impact would be moving
 
02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:32.149 align:start position:0%
memo out what the impact would be moving
forward

02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
but i believe that most school districts
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
extremely prudent in their use of funds
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
and not committing um you know
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
future obligations on behalf of local
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers based on that advice that they
 
02:00:46.719 --> 02:00:49.109 align:start position:0%
taxpayers based on that advice that they
receive

02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from mr
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
fruit school board association nope
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
no we have missed representative luno
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
is last um we had scott marion but
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
he has not been in the meeting today so
 
02:01:13.679 --> 02:01:14.070 align:start position:0%
he has not been in the meeting today so
that's

02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
it okay where we're going next uh with
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
this discussion is that
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
we do have three amendments here i'm
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
going to start out first with the
 
02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.510 align:start position:0%
going to start out first with the
amendment

02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh you you should have received this one
 
02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh you you should have received this one
from

02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh house committee services
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh or from uh
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's uh amendment 10 10h
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
it was written by the department of
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
education as
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
my name at the top of it so this is
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment which deals with third
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
grade reading
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
stores and also it
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
identifies with all the issues which we
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
talked about today
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
taking the higher of the abm accounts
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
you based on either 2018-19
 
02:02:09.330 --> 02:02:09.340 align:start position:0%
or the 2021 uh years
 
02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:10.709 align:start position:0%
or the 2021 uh years
[Music]

02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
mark do you have a little bit of
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
information you can share with us come
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
some of the rationale for
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
this particular amendment yep so
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um for the the third grade reading
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
differential aid component
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy formula um we use
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
testing assessment data and so in the
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
spring of 2019
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have really clean what we call normal
 
02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.990 align:start position:0%
we have really clean what we call normal
data

02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2020 the assessment was
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
waived so we have
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have data and then going
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
forward if we look at 20
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
this spring coming up it's unclear
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
there's uncertainty about how good the
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
data is going to be
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
with the assessment this spring um what
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
the participation will be
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know um so what this amendment
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
does is to when we do the calculation
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
um we'll have uh what the intent of this
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislation likely is is
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
to have clean data to look at um so
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's what this fix seeks to do
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mark so everybody in
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
the committee you have an opportunity to
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
ask mark question if you want at this
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
point in time basically
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to look at the higher of the
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
abma counts and that's most likely going
 
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
2018-19 that would be basing on a future
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay with that and rick yes
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and and that would apply
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
specifically to the third grade reading
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct part of differentiating
 
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
that's correct part of differentiating
yes

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'd like to do next is
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
we'll take these
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh amendments in uh numerical order
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
so you have both of them why don't you
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
start out reps
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
with uh your first one no great great
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
um and and if it's okay with the um with
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
the chair i'll probably
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know talk about one then the other
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then sort of
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
um look at the um the fiscal impact
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
of um of both of them um
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
but i do have that broken out um
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
separately so
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
um so thanks very much mr chair and
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
um bringing forward um uh two amendments
 
02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
the first one being um uh amendment 2020
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
1012 h and uh i believe
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
um i sent sort of an advanced copy out
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
to members of the committee
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
last evening followed up with with uh
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
with another email this morning
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
um what uh what 1012h
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
does is restores the the fiscal capacity
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
disparity equitable grant which was a
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 school funding package uh
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
as included in the um the
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
the current um uh biennium uh budget
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh under house bill 4. and um what the
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
is a couple things it uh it extends
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
the um that uh fiscal disparity
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
grant through the rest of the current
 
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.669 align:start position:0%
grant through the rest of the current
biennium

02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and fy23
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
and it also updates the parameters used
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
to calculate
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
this grant based upon the fact that
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the department of revenue
 
02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.709 align:start position:0%
that the department of revenue
administration

02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
has uh has updated information on on
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
property values statewide
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
and and so just to briefly describe what
 
02:05:37.119 --> 02:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
and and so just to briefly describe what
the

02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh what the grant does is uh is it
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
provides a little
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
additional um state dollars um
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
about 50 million dollars in total um to
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
um to school districts by virtue of
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
member municipalities
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
that that basically have lower than
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
state average uh property that equalized
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
property valuation per pupil
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and its property valuation times
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
property tax rate obviously that
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
that generates some you know tax dollars
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
used to
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
fund public schools so when as as dr
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
kaskadin was saying when when you've got
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
communities that only have
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
30 percent of their or for 35 of their
 
02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:24.069 align:start position:0%
30 percent of their or for 35 of their
properties

02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know as taxable properties uh it um
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
it suppresses total property valuation
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
and communities like that you know tend
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
to have to work
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
and when i say work i mean pay property
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
that are that are between three and in
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
some cases 10 times
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
higher than um than other
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
towns across the state so so
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
the um the fiscal capacity disparity
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
equitable grants like i said it's about
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars in total
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
same as it is in fy 21 are directed
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
to these communities that just have to
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
work super hard
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
harder than than most um to um
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh to generate the local um the local uh
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
tax dollars or the yeah the local
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
revenues they need
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to to fund their their public
 
02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
to uh to to fund their their public
schools

02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
and um and districts can use them you
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
know uh you know ways they want i mean
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
some of them need to need to put it
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
towards property tax relief
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
some of them as as dr prue was saying uh
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
are putting it towards
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
one-time expenses and others have to put
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
it towards operating expenses
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
i mean these are all things that school
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
districts um uh deal with
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
and um but it's
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's it's uh
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's directing state dollars to where
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're needed most
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
the um uh the second the next amendment
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
is um restores the the second
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of the equitable grants that were
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
included in the uh
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh uh 20 20 21
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
um state budget and uh and so this
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
is um amendment number uh uh 1020h
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
and uh the second grant is tied to
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh concentrations of um of
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh higher concentrations of free and
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
um student population and so as um
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
as mr mclanch was was talking about
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
there's um there's a very well
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
understood and strong correlation
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
between the uh the the cost of education
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
and um and higher uh concentrations
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
of of students who live in um low
 
02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
of of students who live in um low
socioeconomic

02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh conditions and so what uh what this
 
02:08:50.719 --> 02:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
uh conditions and so what uh what this
grant

02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
does is uh as opposed to the other one
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
which was sort of a
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayer equity and student equity this
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
is squarely a student equity
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
type of um uh type of grant and again
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
direct some uh directs approximately 11
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
to 12 million dollars
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
statewide to districts that have
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
um uh higher uh percentages
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
of of students that come from low
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic backgrounds
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh helps those districts address those
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
higher costs
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that they have and as the chair
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
was um
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
was was also you know mentioning uh
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
earlier during the uh
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um there's a very
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
strong correlation
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh between um between you know
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
poverty uh low social social economic
 
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:41.669 align:start position:0%
poverty uh low social social economic
status

02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
status
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
i believe um rick also talked about
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
property valuations and student outcomes
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
and um and you know like like i think a
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
lot of us
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know feel we've got uh we've got a
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
lot to be proud of when it comes to
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
public education
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
in the granite state but unfortunately
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's just not everywhere and uh and so
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
direct state dollars to where they're
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
needed most
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
is um it's good for students and it's
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
good for property taxpayers
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um next i would
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
so so everybody's got copies of these
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
two amendments right
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're good we're good on that um i
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
i wanted to sort of uh move forward to
 
02:10:25.199 --> 02:10:26.149 align:start position:0%
i wanted to sort of uh move forward to
um

02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
to uh a report that was
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
prepared by the office of the
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it's dated november 24th 2020 and
 
02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
and it's dated november 24th 2020 and
it's

02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's preliminary and um and you know
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
stuff may have wiggled around a little
 
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:42.149 align:start position:0%
stuff may have wiggled around a little
bit

02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
since then but but i think you know at
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
least as far as the um
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
the the grand um you know totals uh i
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
think it's really accurate but
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's a uh it's a town by town um
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that shows what um what the
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
what the state grant um is to
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
school districts in fy 21
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the current year um versus what they
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
would be in
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
fy 22 based on current law
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and statewide you can see that the
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
the state grant for public schools
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
goes down by nearly 90 million dollars
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
um uh senate bill 135 um
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
including the amendments is directed to
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
to to you know closing this this
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
gap and what senator hennessey uh was
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
talking about during the introduction
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
is a big part of this gap you know about
 
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:46.870 align:start position:0%
is a big part of this gap you know about
about

02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
35 40 percent of it uh is due to
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
artificially suppressed enrollment
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
numbers the adma numbers
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic so so being able to
 
02:11:57.599 --> 02:11:58.229 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic so so being able to
rely

02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
rely
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
on on fall 29 the greater fall night
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
2019 or fall 2020 is going to make a lot
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
of difference
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
for um uh for school districts and um
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that gets you about well i think
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
what what senator hennis
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
hennessey said is about 45 million
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
um so it gets you it gets you you know
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
maybe not quite
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
halfway uh to this it also includes
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
about 12 million of that 45 about 12
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is a statutory index um
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh increase in in cost that are applied
 
02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
uh increase in in cost that are applied
to

02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy uh numbers and the
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
numbers so um so senate bill 135
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
is introduced get you part of the way
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
there you know
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
about a well you know if you roll back
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
the cost index
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
gets you about a third of the way there
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
these two amendments
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
get you the rest of the way there and
 
02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:57.109 align:start position:0%
get you the rest of the way there and
and

02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what i want to sort of draw
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
your your
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh your attention to next so so the lba
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
shows the 90 million dollar deficit and
 
02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.109 align:start position:0%
shows the 90 million dollar deficit and
um

02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and now we get to uh now we get
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
to a luno spreadsheet
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
so this is not an official um
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh lba spreadsheet i i certainly don't
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to represent it
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
as as being anything other than just for
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
comparison purposes
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
just so that we can sort of see um uh
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh what um what these two amendments
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
would cost
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
but uh does everybody have a copy you
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
know what i'm referring to right now
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's a spreadsheet i think it says sb
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
135 with amendments for equitable grants
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
for comparison purposes
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
only uh sent it out last night again
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh like the lba spreadsheet
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a town by town
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
and in the um in the
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the first part of the spreadsheet
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
is uh is taken right from uh department
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
of education data
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
you can see the two columns for the um
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh 2019 um adma
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the 2020 adma and then um
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh the similar things for the free and
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
reduced price launch adma
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
and uh from 20 from
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
2019 and and again from 2020
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
you can see how it selects the higher of
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
the two
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
for each of those categories so this is
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
taking us right through
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135 is passed in the senate
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
and then moving to the right hand side
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the spreadsheet
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
you can see the uh the two red columns
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh are the are the equitable grants for
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
free and
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch uh for fy21
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
and that comes to a little under uh 12
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars 11.73
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars and then the fy 21
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
um equitable grant for physical capacity
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
disparity aid
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh which comes to 47.5 million dollars
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
um so all together it's about 60 million
 
02:15:09.679 --> 02:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
um so all together it's about 60 million
dollars

02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
and both those grants disappear on
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
june 30th of of this year so that's 60
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars that our school
 
02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
million dollars that our school
districts

02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
will um uh will lose in equitable grants
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
again equitable grants
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
um to improve student equity and
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer equity
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
in um in uh in districts that
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
that need it most and um
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and then you can see in the two blue
 
02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
and and then you can see in the two blue
columns

02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
columns
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
right next to each what um what the
 
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.270 align:start position:0%
right next to each what um what the
amendment

02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
um 1020h does in terms of um
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
restoring and extending the free and
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
equitable grant you know it's funny
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
going down through it i mean i just
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
applied the my the formula calculations
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
are sort of at the top of the column
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and it comes down nearly dollar for
 
02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:02.229 align:start position:0%
and and it comes down nearly dollar for
dollar

02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
um for what was um was was in the doe
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh report so so that made me feel really
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
good that i actually got the formula
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
right in my spreadsheet
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
um uh on the um on the
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
the next two columns you can see
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
something similar
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
with the um with the fiscal uh capacity
 
02:16:21.599 --> 02:16:22.149 align:start position:0%
with the um with the fiscal uh capacity
um

02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
equitable grant uh we the the amendment
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
does update some of the parameters uh in
 
02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:28.709 align:start position:0%
does update some of the parameters uh in
there

02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
so um uh because uh based on
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
guidance that that mark i think
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think you gave me the guidance
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday that we'd probably be used
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the department would be using 2019
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
um equalized valuation data from the dra
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
so so obviously 2019 it's they're higher
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
valuations than than in 2018 so
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
so we updated um some of these
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
parameters from
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
from the low of 350 000 updated that to
 
02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.230 align:start position:0%
from the low of 350 000 updated that to
420

02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
420
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
and updated the high end from a million
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to a million
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
fifty and um um and
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
it it comes in right around the same the
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
same price
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
tag i mean it's a little bit more but
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
um uh but obviously this is this is just
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
modeling these aren't final numbers
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh but uh but just to just just to
 
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:24.469 align:start position:0%
uh uh but uh but just to just just to
show

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
show
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
what what it would mean for for towns
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and school districts across the state
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
so the way to read these is that those
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
red columns
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they're getting this year
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
if the two amendments aren't uh aren't
 
02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:40.549 align:start position:0%
if the two amendments aren't uh aren't
passed

02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
then they would get zero
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
for fy22 and fy23 so
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
in some cases in some cases they might
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
based on changes in valuation or free
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
and reduced price
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
launch in some cases they might get a
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
little bit less
 
02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
so it's not a perfect um
 
02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:02.950 align:start position:0%
so it's not a perfect um
[Music]

02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's not identical to what it was in fy
 
02:18:05.359 --> 02:18:06.389 align:start position:0%
it's not identical to what it was in fy
21

02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
21
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
but it's it's formula driven it's very
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
close and if we don't do something like
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
it the answer is zero
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
so so you know um and
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know rick's heard me say it a
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
million times
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
i hope we all agree that that when
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
looking at town by towns
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
you need to use some discipline and not
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
just go to your town
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
first but to see what's happening in
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
manchester see what's happening in
 
02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
manchester see what's happening in
berlin

02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
berlin
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
see what's happening in pittsfield uh
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
how about
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know newport um which is 10 miles up
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
the road from 15 miles up the road from
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
where i'm sitting right now
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh in claremont and um and and see what
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
it means for
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
um for those those most you know
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
districts that have some of the highest
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
challenges across the state whether
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's in um
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
property valuation or or poverty or both
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
and um um you know and do that first and
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
then turn to your own
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
um you know home district uh too because
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
i you know i understand that's important
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
um anyway finally what
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
what um what i want to uh mention
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
is um is that uh
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
all of this follows on the
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
heavily bipartisan work that
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
done during the last session where where
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative ladd and i worked um
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
worked very closely together
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
in in developing this package of
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
equitable grants the free and reduced
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
price lunch grant
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
as part of amendment 1020
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity equitable
 
02:19:50.319 --> 02:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity equitable
grant

02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
as part of you know what's contained in
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
amendment 1012
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
and um and and uh we we
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
put these things into back then it was
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
called house bill 709
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and um and it passed our
 
02:20:06.399 --> 02:20:07.429 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and um and it passed our
committee

02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
um strong bipartisan vote um ought to
 
02:20:10.479 --> 02:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
um strong bipartisan vote um ought to
pass

02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
on a vote of 17-2 came to the floor of
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
passed 262 to 82 and
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
and um and so you know these are these
 
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
and um and so you know these are these
are

02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is a package that that that i hope
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
can continue to be unifying in terms of
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
our recognition
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
of of the need for the state to support
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
its public schools um in particular
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
schools that have the um
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
the highest amount of need and um
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and then i you know uh
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'll sort of wrap up uh uh
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
things there i know i know people
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
probably have questions well where's the
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the money gonna come from um first of
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
all i think there's a policy decision
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the house education committee
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
um but uh but you know if you're looking
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
about where the money's gonna come from
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um uh house ways and means just up the
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh revenue estimate
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
um uh uh last week
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
increased it by 134 million dollars
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh have not allocated that anyway in
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
fact i think it's all allocated to the
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the rainy day fund there's a
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
estimated surplus in the education trust
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
fund of between 21 and 44 million
 
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:28.630 align:start position:0%
fund of between 21 and 44 million
dollars

02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh come the end of this school year so
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
um i i have confidence that the funds
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
i have confidence that uh property
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to want to
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
want to see this done and i think it's
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of students in our
 
02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of students in our
state

02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative um i
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
just want to check in a few words that
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at these amendments
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at them in terms
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
of policy considerations right now
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look for example at uh
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then at 10 12 that's uh i believe
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
the one that
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
someone will spoke to first dealing with
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the physical capacity disparity
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to see some numbers there
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about influx
 
02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about influx
evaluation

02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
property valuations we we've
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
batted these numbers around over the
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
last several years in fact we even
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
batted around
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
earlier this year in hb 608
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
where this fiscal capacity type formula
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
was within that bill uh we just didn't
 
02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
was within that bill uh we just didn't
have

02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
know the the time to play with numbers
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and try to get it right uh but
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
i i know there are a few differences
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
here when we're looking at
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know where you know i see in 10 12
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's 420 000 or less property valuation
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh we've seen others before which spent
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
600 000
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
or less valuation and going up to
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
another upper level where
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
it cuts off usually it's over a million
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
bucks when
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
1.1 1.14 this one breaks off at
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
a little over one so
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
the policy is that we recognize and
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
understand that there are districts out
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
there that need
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
support that are unable to raise us
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
locally and to remain and eliminate the
 
02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
locally and to remain and eliminate the
disparities

02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
disparities
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
in inequities that was one of the uh
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
rationale or policy decisions we put in
 
02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.469 align:start position:0%
rationale or policy decisions we put in
608

02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
608
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
also hb 242 which went over to
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
the out of this committee and went
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
to a second committee 242
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
mentions physical capacity disparity
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
right within it
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
so we're all recognizing that we need to
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
do something
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
with this so uh i don't know if i
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with all the figures i
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to play with the
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
figures yet
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
but i that the policy here is accurate
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's for it's and i've sat down and
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
talked with mark earlier this year
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
regarding this type of formula and and
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh so we've done that earlier um
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
and in regard to the
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
one-time money that we're talking about
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
there with the free and reduced and the
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh the uh device property valuation
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh that comes up to write a little a
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
little over 59
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
59.2 call it you know whatever 60
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
that is uh money which has
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
allowed some of the districts to do what
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
they need to do
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
but it also is created to eliminate
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
those disparities and we do know there's
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
a relationship
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
between you know achievement and and
 
02:24:52.479 --> 02:24:53.670 align:start position:0%
between you know achievement and and
poverty

02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
the question i have for you rexella luno
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
is that we also recognize that there's
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
inequities and disparities even amongst
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
some communities that have the
 
02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.349 align:start position:0%
some communities that have the
wherewithal

02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
wherewithal
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
so how do we account for those like we
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
tried to do in 242 and i don't know if
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
all the answers in it but we tried to
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
identify how to support a school
 
02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
identify how to support a school
district

02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
that might even be a a district which
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
keeps us swept
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
or or but they also we know have pockets
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
of 30 percent of the kids are
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
not functioning at a level do they get a
 
02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
not functioning at a level do they get a
support

02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
to in those disparities within those
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
districts is oftentimes between
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
subgroups within the district um
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
which uh that's where we need to really
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
improve within this entire state
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that question's for you dave yeah no
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take that thanks very
 
02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take that thanks very
much

02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
um rick for for laying that out um
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
but and and and that's that's actually
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
what the um what the
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
the house bill i'm sorry the amendment
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
um 10
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
20 h uh contemplate so this is the the
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh free and reduced price lunch um
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
equitable grant
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if you go to the page six of that
 
02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:14.630 align:start position:0%
and if you go to the page six of that
spreadsheet

02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the luno spreadsheet um you'll
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see and i'm just going to pick on
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
one of our beautiful lakes region
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh towns wolfeboro and um and
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know there's an excess swept town uh
 
02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
you know there's an excess swept town uh
they're

02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're not obviously receiving
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
any fiscal capacity disparity grant
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
but you can see that at least based on
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
the the model
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
um that that i ran on this
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
because of their uh almost 29
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch student
 
02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:47.429 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch student
population

02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the 700 students they would
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
receive an additional 42
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
000 um in um in an equitable grant
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what we did in
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 709
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it's consistent with um with what uh
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions now from
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
the committee representatives
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um i went and i was looking at
 
02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you um i went and i was looking at
berlin

02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
berlin
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
because we had been talking about berlin
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm noticing that they actually have
 
02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:27.270 align:start position:0%
and i'm noticing that they actually have
an

02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
increase in students but they lose about
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
two million dollars and i'm wondering
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm looking at
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
um both
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
sets according to yours they increase in
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
students and according to the
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
estimated um one from the state they're
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
losing about two million dollars
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if i'm wondering how
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
much of that
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
is um law their loss of their estimate
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
of free and reduced
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
students and how much of that is because
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
additional one-time aid
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
um that you that is included in that
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
great great thank you for the for the
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
question uh representative lucas
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
so um so looking at at the
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
the lba um spreadsheet you can see
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
as you've pointed out berlin loses
 
02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
as you've pointed out berlin loses
approximately

02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in in-state aid
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then if you go back to the luno
 
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
and then if you go back to the luno
spreadsheet

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
and look and look at berlin you can see
 
02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
and look and look at berlin you can see
that

02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
that 1.6 million dollars
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
of that of that 2 million is from the
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh the equitable fiscal capacity um
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
grant and another 210
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
000 is from the free and the enhanced
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh equitable free and reduced price
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
lunch grant so of that two million
 
02:28:58.160 --> 02:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
lunch grant so of that two million
dollars

02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
about 1.85 million of that
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
is due to the grants that um that these
 
02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
is due to the grants that um that these
two

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
amendments would restore thank you
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
further questions it's a discussion
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay i know it kind of diverts away from
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
our hearing process
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
but we had nobody else there for the
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
hearings and
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think that folks needed to have this
 
02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:28.309 align:start position:0%
i think that folks needed to have this
explanation

02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh we've been battling this particular
 
02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
uh we've been battling this particular
issue

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
for years
 
02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:35.110 align:start position:0%
for years

[Music]
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and uh we are because the pandemic
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's really hastening the need to
 
02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
it's really hastening the need to
recognize

02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that it's got to be fixed somehow here
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
rick thanks um i i think it might be i
 
02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:52.309 align:start position:0%
rick thanks um i i think it might be i
mean

02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
we are sort of blending hearing with
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
work session
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
right now and i really appreciate that
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
um uh given the importance of
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
and the timeliness of this but i was
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could talk a little bit
 
02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:04.790 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could talk a little bit
about

02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
how a um multiple amendments
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
um can be considered by a committee
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
and what that results in and if maybe we
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
could even get
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
get uh mark to weigh in on the
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh compatibility of these three
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
amendments with each other
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
just going to close this hearing
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then from that we'll go into a
 
02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
and then from that we'll go into a
discussion

02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh on on on what we have in front of us
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
on sb 135 and
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to take any action
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
because i i think there's a lot of
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions folks need to be considering
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and looking at here
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm at this point in time i am not
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
seeing any other folks to testify i'm
 
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
closing down the hearing for 135
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
and opening up right now what was
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
the account there you have that uh
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative shop for the
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
number of people have signed in and
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
support our post
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
that we could mention that for reps and
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh so there were rep shaw
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just double check my
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
figures we had 389 in support
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah six opposed
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and we had originally
 
02:31:31.359 --> 02:31:32.150 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and we had originally
scheduled

02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
seven to testify but we had
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
if you include the two from the school
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the department of education
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
and dr corrine
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
we give
 
02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:14.830 align:start position:0%
we give
[Music]

02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
i've talked with him just you know prior
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
to this and he's going to be requesting
 
02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:21.429 align:start position:0%
to this and he's going to be requesting
that

02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
right off here um so
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh i think that yeah if we're going to
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
do something we're going to have to kind
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so so thanks rick i you know i
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
think that was
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think what what what what ralph's
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
asking was sort of
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
um along the lines of what um what what
 
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
i was sort of putting up
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
um a little while ago which is
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
the the steps forward for the committee
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
for for for a committee when it's facing
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
and what what um because i think you can
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i know we're not going to exact today
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
but but at after after
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
a committee has has approved multiple
 
02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:09.750 align:start position:0%
a committee has has approved multiple
amendments

02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't that then create a committee
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
amendment one
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
one merged amendment yes that's what i
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
understand we do have the clerk
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
online here with us right now is paul
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
smith there
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh i believe that the clerk that you
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
see in our meeting is actually
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
rep shaw's workstation
 
02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.830 align:start position:0%
rep shaw's workstation
[Music]

02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:49.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]

02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.230 --> 02:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
16 and 16a
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's on three different amendments and
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
they all say a different thing
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
they all say something different before
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay um on the first one
 
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
on 10 12 it says
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
down to line 26 paragraph
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
1 of section 236 of this actually
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2021 and then
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
line 27 says uh
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
paragraphs two and three of this section
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh this actually i'll take it back to 30
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
20 23. and if you look at
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
10 13 and then you look at 10 20
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
they all say something different for
 
02:36:47.439 --> 02:36:48.309 align:start position:0%
they all say something different for
that

02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
so barbara what you've picked up on is
 
02:36:58.240 --> 02:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
so barbara what you've picked up on is
the

02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the most complicated part of of these
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
because they refer to statutes that are
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
in current law
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
have repeals repeal dates
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
of of of 6 30 20 2021
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
and each of the two amendments has to be
 
02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
able to stand on their own
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
so so um so
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal capacity disparity
 
02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:29.590 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal capacity disparity
amendment

02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
so 1012 h
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
allows the repeal to stand
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
on the free and reduced price lunch part
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
but extends the repeal date on the
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal capacity disparity piece
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
to 630 2023
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand amendment 1020h
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
does exactly the the opposite it allows
 
02:37:55.359 --> 02:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
does exactly the the opposite it allows
the

02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
provision in current law to sunset
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
on 6 30 2021 but extends the free and
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
statute through 630 2023
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so the repeal language is a little
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
funky um
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh in getting that right we i spent a
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
lot of time with ols
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh and mary ellen working
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
working on
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
on this to make sure we got it right uh
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
the the most important part though is
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
if the committee were to uh
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
approve uh these two amendments all
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
three amendments
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
let's say then then the
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
then th that the amendments are
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
basically the amendment 10 10 12 h
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
would would would extend the
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity grant
 
02:38:57.920 --> 02:38:58.710 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity grant
language

02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
through 630 2023 amendment 1020h
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
would extend the free and reduced price
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
lunch grant
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
through um through 6 30 20
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
23 and the committee amendment would
 
02:39:13.439 --> 02:39:14.070 align:start position:0%
23 and the committee amendment would
reflect

02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
both of those um um you know merged
 
02:39:17.439 --> 02:39:22.150 align:start position:0%
both of those um um you know merged
elements

02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
barbara also referred to 1013h which i
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
sent over last night
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i sent it over with it with a with a
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
note saying that
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
that it still had an error in the in the
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
repeal language
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
1020h corrects that
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
so the the two amendments in play here
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
that i've brought forward
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
are 10 12 10 20 and then you've got 10
 
02:39:57.040 --> 02:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
are 10 12 10 20 and then you've got 10
10.

02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
10.
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be another decision 13
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
is gone
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
13 is gone
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
several people here didn't have that i
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so um i guess the next step for us
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
there is some necessity regardless how
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
do we do this thing
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we try to get to finance as quickly
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
however obviously there is gonna have to
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
be some
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
working with ols here and with
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh dale v8 um
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
so uh and i planned on not having any
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
sessions or anything
 
02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
next week i was just gonna have folks
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
have you know a week
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
off which would be kind of pleasant and
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
then the following week of course we're
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
into uh three days of session
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
down in bedford so the
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
the next time we can really get to and
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
address this thing would be most likely
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know almost like two weeks two full
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that's looking at a time frame there
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
um and i think we do need to work on
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
these right here before we can go any
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
so any comments from the community out
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
there remember
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the hole i'm glad luis andrews has had
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have one question
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
which i
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer and maybe we'll
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
have to look into
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
i understand the state of new hampshire
 
02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
is going to receive
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 350 million dollars
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
for school districts and i'm wondering
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
if any of that
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
can be applied to this that we're
 
02:41:54.399 --> 02:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
can be applied to this that we're
looking

02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
to get from the taxpayers thank you
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's a question we've asked on so many
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
other types of top topics too
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
in regards to you know ear handling
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
devices etc
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
in schools i don't know if we have
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
clear well we do have we did get from
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
caitlin some definition of how the
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
s or moneys can be used um
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
they they it was specific it happened
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
about a page and a half
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
of options you can use it for it's
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
pretty wide open
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
however i i don't have an answer for you
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
on it right now
 
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
um whether someone is going to be used
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
to supplement parts of our formula i
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
of course that's i don't think so
 
02:42:38.399 --> 02:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
of course that's i don't think so
personally

02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that we've got to be very
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
careful when we do that too
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the issue from a policy perspective
 
02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:47.030 align:start position:0%
and the issue from a policy perspective
not

02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
speaking as a principle of a school
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
that funding schools on a one-time basis
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to plan in terms of
 
02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.110 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to plan in terms of
your

02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
labor your your your teachers your paris
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
teacher aides whatever you want to call
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
them it's just almost
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to plan year to year and have
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
a long-range plan
 
02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
and effect so it's wise not to use
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
one-time monies
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
in your basic formula that you have here
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy is one thing we're talking
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
items right here
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
which are apart from adequacy their uh
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal class maternity leave etc was
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
apart from in addition to it comes out
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of a formula but it's not part of
 
02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
part of a formula but it's not part of
atticus

02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
atticus
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't have an answer for you
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
representing ambrose on that
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good question um i doubt very
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
seriously that we're going to be
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
we should consider those monies as part
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
of our what we're doing in supporting of
 
02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
of our what we're doing in supporting of
schools

02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
i think that's a supplemental amount of
 
02:43:49.439 --> 02:43:52.950 align:start position:0%
i think that's a supplemental amount of
money

02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have a hand raised from uh there you
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
have your hand on mark
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
thanks uh thanks for the question um
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
the the 350 million going out that's
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
directly to the schools under a federal
 
02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.429 align:start position:0%
directly to the schools under a federal
formula

02:44:07.429 --> 02:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
formula
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
so it's already the federal the federal
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
government will decide the allocation
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
um the state will do the allocation but
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
um the fed will
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
determine what that allocation
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
methodology is going to be essentially
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
so that money's already going to the
 
02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.469 align:start position:0%
so that money's already going to the
schools

02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that's especially
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned to us earlier yes
 
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
your neighborhood listen remember the
 
02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
ladder thank you
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
listen to you talk about the uh date
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps next week often the following
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
week uh
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
invested just for a modification
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
what is the drop dead date that this
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
these amendments and this document has
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
completed so it could be acted on in
 
02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
completed so it could be acted on in
this

02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
next budget well there there's
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
for the house bills to drop that date
 
02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:00.550 align:start position:0%
for the house bills to drop that date
almost

02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
but for for the senate bills which are
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
just arriving which we don't even have
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
yet it's much later uh however
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
then there's another date too is the
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
date for
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
finance to have the bills out on the
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
and hb one and two if we miss that
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
we'll end up having to use a bill that
 
02:45:21.439 --> 02:45:22.070 align:start position:0%
we'll end up having to use a bill that
morris

02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
morris
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know like that's been done
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
previously uh with a three or four hp
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
and and uh i don't think we want to go
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
down that route
 
02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think we need to try to rectify this
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
on the outside as soon as possible
 
02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
finance i believe is acting
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
next i don't have a date right now does
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
anybody out there have that date
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
monday monday and tuesday i think
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
i i thought it was yeah a little later
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah tuesday i think
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
but but that's right on us and
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so this is why when we talk about
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
things like the merger of the university
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
system and that they're looking for
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendments there
 
02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
and there's uh that's unresolved uh
 
02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
so they're very very busy putting this
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
hd2 together
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
this would be um
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
this has policy but it also has you know
 
02:46:17.439 --> 02:46:18.070 align:start position:0%
this has policy but it also has you know
a

02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know it has some figures in there
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
right now and those of course the page
 
02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:25.429 align:start position:0%
right now and those of course the page
figures

02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
figures
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
so but we're at the deadline we're there
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and sixth is
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
the last
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
sentence okay
 
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
i was just told the sixth is the last
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
day to report
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
seth bill is going through a second
 
02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:44.630 align:start position:0%
seth bill is going through a second
committee

02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
may 6th may 76 may right
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we have time
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
thanks again yes
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
yeah my battery went out and um
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
represent uh leon isn't here to plug
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
into his extension cord
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
anyway looking at
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
the two amendments um 10
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
and 12 i do not have a problem with
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
except for
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know line 26 27 i haven't looked at
 
02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:24.790 align:start position:0%
you know line 26 27 i haven't looked at
that

02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
because i mean our town like a lot of
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
towns have just been finished in the
 
02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.150 align:start position:0%
towns have just been finished in the
evaluation

02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
so our valuation is increased
 
02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that helps i i've been trying to find
 
02:47:38.950 --> 02:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
out what it is right now
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
and with our population to see how we
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
fall into that
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh but i do i mean other than
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
the 1020h is
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
again looking at paragraph two and
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and three and whatnot
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't looked at that but i've no
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
problem with the
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
increasing the equal evaluation for
 
02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:03.429 align:start position:0%
increasing the equal evaluation for
people

02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay did you hear that rexella
 
02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
you you you had a concern with 10 28
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
no other than yeah other than the no
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and other than i mean i
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the language on
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
comparison with you know all those
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendments on
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph one of 236 and paragraph two
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
and three or 236
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
on how they interplay and so that's the
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
only concern i have
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know again yeah that that that was
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
that that was the complex part in these
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
in these amendments and i had to go back
 
02:48:51.269 --> 02:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
we had to go back to hb4
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
from 2019 um uh
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
and um and paragraph 236 which was
 
02:48:57.439 --> 02:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
and um and paragraph 236 which was
repeal

02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
language uh from this and and like i
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
said it got sort of
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
it got sort of funky but um but
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
but we we got it um uh uh
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we got it right through uh through ols
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
late yesterday and i'd be happy to um
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
to work with you offline ralph i can
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
send you the the pieces from hb4
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
and you can see how um i can look it up
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay and just look one does one thing
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
one does the opposite
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah but that why i mentioned
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
before why we need to
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
maybe combine is because depend on how
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
we take the amendments up
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
and what the result will be you know
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
if we do the one before the other then
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the the the intention is for for
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
all these amendments to be compatible
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
with each other so they can stand alone
 
02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay there's there's several options
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
which we have here of course
 
02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
we can't take action today uh i think
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
we'd be wrong in doing it but uh
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
we need to find out when uh this
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
information that we have would be best
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh the best serve the finance
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
in finance if they need to have this
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
right off
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
we could always have amendment meet
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
and do an amendment quickly sometime
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
next week i hate to do that
 
02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
um but we could do that
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
and then uh uh we would uh
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
shoot it to them um it would probably go
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
up to the house floor and then uh you
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
know we have that discussion go to the
 
02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.110 align:start position:0%
know we have that discussion go to the
second

02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion on this
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
anybody really objecting that we have to
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
