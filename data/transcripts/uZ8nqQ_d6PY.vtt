00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas as she leads
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:38.530 align:start position:0%
 
congratulations

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.390 align:start position:0%
for all
oh

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
so this morning
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
four Bills starting at nine o'clock with
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 we'll break for lunch
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
we'll come back after lunch and at one
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
o'clock we'll have a
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
an executive session on several bills
 
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
and then at 2 30 we will resume
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
with two more public hearings
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll be done with the day
 
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
now as members of the House who have
 
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
been reading the calendar are well aware
 
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
the speaker has called a session for
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
February 14th
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day
 
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
so our committee cannot meet on Tuesday
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
we have two options we can meet on
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
Thursday or we can meet on Friday I'm
 
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.090 align:start position:0%
Thursday or we can meet on Friday I'm
currently

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
in negotiation with representative hunt
 
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
the chair of
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee who shares this
 
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
room with us to find out which of those
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
two days this room is available
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
I should know by the end of uh this
 
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 align:start position:0%
morning's session
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
whether we will be scheduling
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
hearings and executive sessions for next
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
Thursday or next Friday but I asked the
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
members to reserve both days just in
 
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
members to reserve both days just in
case

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
and that concludes uh
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
our announcements on committee business
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
so we can get down to committee business
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
so I would like to open a public hearing
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 281 relative to lease cost
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans of utilities
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
and call on the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Fred Platt
 
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
who was the chair of this the clerk of
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
this committee last session
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
and have him introduce this bill and say
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
welcome back Fred it's great to see you
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair it's great
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
to see a lot of familiar faces and I see
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
some new ones out there hope you enjoy
 
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
your stint in science technology and
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
energy I spent two terms second term is
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
Clerk and my life's been in the
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
utilities industry through Public
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
Service New Hampshire several other
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
places wound up with mass attorney
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
general and Rick office of ratepayer
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
advocacy similar to the job Don creese
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
is doing it's a consumer Advocate this
 
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
build is simple I've sat here the last
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
two terms and said why in the law is
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
still an integrated resource planning
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
requirement why does it still exist
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
because the utilities have all spun off
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
generation ever Source here in New
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being the last holdout but
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
that was several years ago so they have
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
no generation
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a free market essentially I
 
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say free but a market
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
regulated by ISO New England and uh
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
transmission is at a federal level
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
uh this planning transmission planning
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
at ASO New England and uh everything
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
goes to Federal Energy Regulatory
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
Commission for approval so what's left
 
00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:01.099 align:start position:0%
is distribution and in my mind and uh
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh I'll get some disagreement from the
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate which is fine uh the
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
in my mind distribution was quotidian
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
mundane boring uh it's it's just putting
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
a system together to meet the load and
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it isn't touched until enough
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
load is created or generation behind at
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
the end of the distribution so so things
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
have to be expanded
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and I ran this by the department of
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
energy they'll probably speak for
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
themselves but they were pleased with it
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear any pushback from uh
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
utilities but I expect that uh they're
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
concerned about consumer Advocates we'll
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
let the consumer Advocate Don creese
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
Express his concerns and I have offered
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the consumer Advocate that I am open
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
to compromise if something needs to get
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
back in there to have the dis
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
distribution to this file the
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
distribution plans fine uh but he's yet
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
to come up with some language and I'd be
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
happy to work with them and with that
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'll stop and ask if that if there's any
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions of me
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Platt for
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 281 and questions
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Munds has a question
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
coming in thank you I am one of those
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
new members
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
um what is a lease cost integrated
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
resource plan back when utilities had
 
00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:27.769 align:start position:0%
resource plan back when utilities had
generation

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
they could place the generation
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
strategically to avoid transmission
 
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.170 align:start position:0%
strategically to avoid transmission
investment

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:37.820 align:start position:0%
and did that all the time and by
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
by careful planning minimize costs to
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
because they get they have to pass a
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
Prudence test when they invest so they
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
want to be prudent with the money to try
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
to do at least cost uh and that's least
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
cost for rate payers and we used to do
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue requirements analyzes all the
 
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.130 align:start position:0%
Revenue requirements analyzes all the
time

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
and now that they don't own generation
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
they can't have that control of
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
transmission if a generator leaves and
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
there's a gap there they have to build
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
the transmission to cover that Gap with
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
voltage support and so on and so there's
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
no choice
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
and so there's some cost associated with
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
deregulation occurred by that we have
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
more transmission than I otherwise would
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
the distribution has always been
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
let's say you do what you need to do and
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
nothing more so that really wasn't a
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
part of the picture recently this uh
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
there's micro grids and stuff like that
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
at a distribution level and in that case
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
the commission can and should have a
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on on the microgrid and whether
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
it'll pay for itself and so on so that
 
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
information should still be subject
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the puc regardless
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
of this legislation if I hope we answer
 
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.590 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
plett

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Bose and members
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
of sdne for those who don't know me I'm
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
Tom Frantz I'm the director of the
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory Support Division at the New
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
I appear here today to state that the
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
supports HB 281 and we appreciate the
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity this morning to elaborate on
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
why we support HB 281
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a long history of
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
least cost planning going back to the
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
late 1980s I'm going to spend a little
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
bit of time on history and bring us up
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
to today I think that might be useful
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
for some of you
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
its history is tied to generation in
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
particular to the
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
nascent qualifying facilities industry
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
at the time qf says they are known
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
in the qf industry itself was
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
inextricably tied to the zebrook power
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
plant through the forecast of needs and
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
the development of avoided costs
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
and the understanding that that was
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
going to be a very expensive
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
power plant and perhaps there were
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
better options
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
Commission stated in an important order
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
back in the uh
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
early days of lease cost planning it
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
said the objective of the integrated
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
lease cost resource plan is to satisfy
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
future Demand with optimal combination
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
of supply-side resources and demand side
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
programs thus the plan must provide a
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and detailed assessment of
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
all reasonably available demand side and
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
supply side utility investment options
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
to satisfy ratepayers
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
Energy Service needs at the lowest
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
overall costs consistent with the
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
reliable supply of electricity
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
the puc then went on to describe seven
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
areas that would require analysis and
 
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.949 align:start position:0%
areas that would require analysis and
reports

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
in order to meet those lease costs
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning objectives
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
and of course those seven were the
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
forecasts of future demand assessment of
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
supply side options assessment of demand
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
side options
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
assessment of transmission integration
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
of demand and supply side options a
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
two-year implementation plan and of
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
course a calculation of devoided costs
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
and its forecast
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
the overarching theme then and for the
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
next decade was supply-side assessment
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
and treating demand side options on an
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
equivalent basis
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
that rationale change when generation
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
purchase power contracts were divested
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
as part of electric restructuring in the
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
late 1990s
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
for PSNH eversource that was completed
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
in 2002 and 18 and 17 in that period
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
with the sale of the fossil Hydro assets
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
and with that finals step of electric
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
restructuring one of the basic and
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
strongest reasons for least cost
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning also ended
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
so where do we stand now
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
transmission planning is
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
as Mr Platt said
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the ferc and
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
ISO New England is authorized by ferc to
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
operate the New England power grid
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
administer the markets and conduct power
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
system planning
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
customers can shop for their supply from
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
registered competitive electric power
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
suppliers today and many do and for
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
those that don't
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
our electric utilities go out and
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
solicit six months competitive bids for
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
in short though the least cost
 
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
in short though the least cost
integrated

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
planning statute has evolved over time
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
it is costly resource intensive and no
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
longer necessary
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
besides Supply assessment which I've
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
just discussed
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
there are programs and proceedings for
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
other aspects that are in the statute
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
for distributed energy resources for
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
load management and of course Energy
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
Efficiency there are dockets at the puc
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
there are lots of volumes of materials
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
the utilities file Capital budgets
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
forecasts those are all reviewed
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
so the importance of a more reliable
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
resilient grid which cannot be
 
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.449 align:start position:0%
resilient grid which cannot be
overstated

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
overstated
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
but it is currently being addressed
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
through numerous other proceedings
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
before the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
and perhaps most importantly through
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
distribution rate cases where the
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
commission is tasked with looking at and
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
certainly Department energy plays a
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
strong role in this looking at the
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
utilities decisions their costs their
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
Alternatives what they evaluated how
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
they evaluated them and then
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
making a decision on what should go into
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
customers rates
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I've just discussed
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
the department of energy supports
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 281
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
should you decide however to keep the
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
lease costs integrated resource planning
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
statutes but modify the current
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
structure and and language we will
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
gladly offer our assistance if needed
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Franz members from the
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
commit questions for members of the
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington is
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
question uh just so I'm not we're not
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
confused here when you to differentiate
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
least cost planning as it had been
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
required to be done in the past and how
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
the utilities now go about setting
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
default service so people understand the
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
difference could you just briefly
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
explain that sure default Services set
 
00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
every six months the utilities issue
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
rfps they go out and they solicit power
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
in wholesale markets they give estimates
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
of what the load will be
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market a competitive
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
market although we wish it were more
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
competitive to be honest
 
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:25.610 align:start position:0%
competitive to be honest
um

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
response to those solicitations with
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
bids for 24 7 load following service
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
those competitive suppliers uh send in
 
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.620 align:start position:0%
their bids the utilities evaluate them
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
they choose what they believe is the
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
lowest uh cost option and they file them
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
with the Public Utilities Commission the
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
commission holds a hearing a quick
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
turnaround and approves those rates for
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the following six months
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
actually I just noticed you're a
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill so you're not
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask questions about as long
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
as I didn't speak on the bill I could
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
ask questions as a co-sponsor is that
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
the role I think that's the rule yeah
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay it's not the role as you remember
 
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.970 align:start position:0%
okay it's not the role as you remember
it's

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
all right I'll make it quick one way or
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
the other okay okay so the getting rid
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
of this law will not change the method
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
of uh uh coming up with default Service
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
rates then no it will not not change
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
default Service rates
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
um current uh least cost plans under the
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
puc look at the environmental impacts if
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
we did away with these plans what would
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
replace Environmental Protections
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
well there are numerous Environmental
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
Protections already out there from the
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
on especially on uh generation from the
 
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
on especially on uh generation from the
clean

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
clean
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
Air Act of 1992 and its amendments and
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
those are uh
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
followed by all the generators that are
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
out there and over seen by the EPA as
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
well as the Department of Environmental
 
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.010 align:start position:0%
well as the Department of Environmental
Services

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
um but nothing would be required you're
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
saying that there these protections are
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
out there but nothing would be required
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that what's required now
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
would still be required what we look at
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
in the least cost integrated resource
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
plans now we do look at environmental
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
effects of different choices we would
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
look at that as part of a utility rate
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
case for the decisions they make and why
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
they made perhaps a capital investment
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
why they put in a new substation instead
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
of perhaps using demand response or
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resource those those
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
things are when they actually move those
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
into rates we would look at that and
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
have looked at that as part of a rate
 
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.970 align:start position:0%
have looked at that as part of a rate
case

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman has a
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr friends so
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
I want to follow up on on representative
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas's question so let's imagine
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
that that we did still require an
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
integrated at least so uh least cost
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
resource plan but that it was really
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
just focusing on distribution because
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
that's really all that's left
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
would there be any call to have a
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
section on environmental impacts are
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
there environmental impacts that would
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
be relevant there are always
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts that are I believe
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
are relevant any decision made has an
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
environmental economic social impact
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know but but I'll
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you know as you as
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
you heard me say I'm one of the new
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
members of this committee so I'm trying
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
to learn when I'm what I'm gathering is
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
that you know the integrated resource
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
plans are really trying to balance the
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
supply and demand issues and make sure
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
that there is a a mechanism or there was
 
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:52.460 align:start position:0%
a mechanism in place to that that that
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
service could be guaranteed to people
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
given the fact that
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
um you know things are are now kind of
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
dis disjointed I mean you've got as I
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned transmission is
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
handled by ferc and Supply is handled by
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
consumers generation is separate
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
who in the state is looking at that the
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
the overall picture to make sure that
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
overall there's an assurance that
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
um consumers will be able to get access
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
to energy when they need it uh
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
Department of energy has a group that
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
participates thoroughly
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
in the iso New England planning process
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we have members of group of other
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
committees that work on wholesale issues
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
so we also are the agency that's
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
issues the New Hampshire 10-year energy
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
strategy so I would say from that
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
perspective we're the main agency there
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
are other ones
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
but we're probably the main Agency for
 
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.190 align:start position:0%
but we're probably the main Agency for
the

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
overview of
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
generation in the region as well as in
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and distribution now
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
obviously the Public Utilities
 
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
obviously the Public Utilities
Commission

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
is tasked with determining what goes
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
into customers rates after a
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
but we are as others behind me are uh
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
including the consumer Advocate very ad
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
for other questions representative
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
closure has a question uh thank you
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
cherith thank you Mr Francis for taking
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.590 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
the department of Entry is new this
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
might be a POC question but from
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.930 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
what

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:55.940 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.770 align:start position:0%
what
this

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
statute was doing with the plans
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures it was a
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
workload took staff took caught it was
 
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.510 align:start position:0%
workload took staff took caught it was
cost

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy again
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
what could you say on the savings
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
when this no longer has to be done by
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
the PCC thank you well any proceeding
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity cost uh
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
the least cost integrated resource
 
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.029 align:start position:0%
the least cost integrated resource
planning

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
those filings come in they're about this
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
high and they end up being about
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
twice that high for those that are
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
recording this that's anywhere from a
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
four to six inch pile of paper that goes
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
up maybe up to 12 inches by the time the
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings over they require a lot of
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
data and Analysis there's a lot of uh
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
testimony filed on them there's a lot of
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
commitment of resources from a lot of
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
different people including from my group
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
and the dockets
 
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.110 align:start position:0%
and the dockets
last

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
much too long in my opinion we have
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
dockets that are uh I believe the puc is
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
still looking at a 2020 lease cost
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plan of PSNH
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
eversource 2021 from Unitil
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the Liberty one was
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
or the Intel one was just filed
 
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
Liberties is still open so
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
it requires a lot of resources a lot of
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
time a lot of energy and there are a lot
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
of costs and
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity costs are real costs
 
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you chick um
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
so if this is repealed
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
and we have piles
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
of paperwork and submissions
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
if it's repealed those will disappear
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
but what about the reasons a lot of that
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
information we can get and do get uh
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
through other means either it was part
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
of a rate case when you totally comes to
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
change its rates part of the we require
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
and the puc requires that this rules the
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
number of filings that utilities make
 
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
concerning their Capital budgets
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
forecasts things of that nature uh I
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
don't there's a lot of valuable
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
information in the least cost integrated
 
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:17.900 align:start position:0%
resource plan I do not deny that however
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of that anyway and could
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
still get it
 
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.710 align:start position:0%
still get it
foreign

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
okay before we move on to the next
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
question or I just want to confirm to
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
the members that representative
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington is correct that as long as
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
you don't testify on a bill that you're
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of you can ask questions so
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
I apologize to representative Reynolds
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
yesterday I told you you couldn't ask
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions I'd forgotten we changed that
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
rule so I apologize to you for that and
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
I ask you to now ask your question of of
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Franz
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for that um do we
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
have a lot of witnesses for this bill a
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
lot of pink cars we have four more uh
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
Pink cards to go through all right I
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
just want to I'll make it a quick
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
question then uh I don't think I heard
 
00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:08.570 align:start position:0%
question then uh I don't think I heard
you

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
um use the word or your predecessor
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
maybe but
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
um is it fair to describe integrated
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
resource planning as a relic of the old
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated highly regulated
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
centrally planned public utility system
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
that existed prior to what we now call
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
deregulation and things like the forward
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
capacity market and all that and that
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
this is long overdue
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
I mean would you just I I think it's
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
overdue I think it's a the statute has
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
evolved I think to try to uh
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
keep Pace with the changing environment
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
and the changing industry
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
um what happened back in the late 80s
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
90s leading up to restructuring I think
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
the statue made a lot of sense and I
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
think it lost a lot of its
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
rationale for existence with
 
00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
rationale for existence with
restructuring

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman has a
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
question another question thank you Mr
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to follow up on
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative plugger's question about
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
the actual uh cost to doe of of
 
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.070 align:start position:0%
the actual uh cost to doe of of
complying

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
complying
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
so you stated that we're looking at four
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
to six inches of paper maybe even up to
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
12 inches of paper would that still be
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
true if the report was covering only
 
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.450 align:start position:0%
true if the report was covering only
distribution

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
well it mostly covers distribution even
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
now uh it's
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's really not just the paper I mean I
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
I don't wanna I'm just saying but the
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
filing's like but it's it's also the
 
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:36.980 align:start position:0%
resources it's the time the uh and
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
resources that go into the analysis
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's filed uh these the
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
many many many months and even years
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the dockets go on
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
and we address a lot of the issues
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
in other proceedings reliabilities
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
addressed in rape cases reliability and
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
resiliencies addressed through uh
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
vegetation management tree trimming
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
dockets like that
 
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:07.940 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of aspects
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we do any way that are also
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in the least cost
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
and historically even if they may put in
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
and utilities have done this put it in
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
capital that really ended up in a rate
 
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
case that wasn't even in there these
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
cost integrated resource plan
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
and and to use the term the rate cases
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
where the rubber really meets the road
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for Mr Franz we
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here I know you
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
have to get off to another meeting so uh
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you we'll move on
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on our consumer Advocate
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Don creese and before Mr crease
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
begins I will point out to people who
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
are here for the public hearing on House
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 298 which was scheduled for 9 30.
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'll make you all aware that we are we
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
still have four pink cards to go for
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that we're currently
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
on so it's likely that public hearing
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
won't start until 10 o'clock or so
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
so if you have something else that you
 
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:19.820 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
just be aware of that
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll now turn the
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
microphone over to the consumer Advocate
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr crease good morning
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos thank you for the
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify uh as has been
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
previously advertised my perspective on
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is somewhat different than the
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
previous couple of speakers I do thank
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
representative plett for introducing
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
this bill because I share his opinion
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
that our lease costs planning statute is
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
broken but I favor reform rather than
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
repeal and I would like to explain why
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
the premise of requiring utilities to
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
conduct lease cost planning remain sound
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
even in the era of restructuring
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
considered in isolation it is difficult
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
to argue with whatever the next capital
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
investment a utility intends to put into
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
rates is whether it's big or small but
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
without an eye on the big picture there
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
is a very real danger that the utility
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
were over will over build and service
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
will be more expensive than it needs to
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
be utilities I hope this isn't shocking
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
to anybody have every incentive to gold
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
plate their systems given the Paradigm
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
we use to set rates rate payers deserve
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
better than that someone keeping a
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
Vigilant eye on what total strategy the
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
utility is deploying in both the near
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
and the long term to assure safe and
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
reliable service at the lowest possible
 
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.370 align:start position:0%
reliable service at the lowest possible
cost

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
without an integrated resource planning
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
requirement the only real regulatory
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
oversight as Mr Frantz just testified
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
occurs after the fact after the utility
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
has made Capital Investments that will
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
automatically go into rates at the next
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
ensuing rate case if not sooner by then
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
the scrutiny just comes too late while
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's true that an investment can be
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
disallowed for purposes of rate recovery
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
after the fact in Practical terms that
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
never happens
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
for example beginning about a decade ago
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
a certain large utility I won't mention
 
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:30.500 align:start position:0%
its name but its initials are e
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
deliberately opted to avoid investing in
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
advanced metering infrastructure Ami by
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
opting instead for Less Advanced AMR
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
technology that had the effect of
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
pushing grid modernization farther into
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
the future than rate payers deserve and
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
by the way all of that exists within the
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
realm of a distribution service so the
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
idea that distribution service and what
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
utilities invest and don't invest in
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
their distribution infrastructure is
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
quotation that's a really great word and
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'm really glad that representative
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
Platt used it because usually I'm the
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
guy that gets accused of using the five
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
dollar words I just don't agree with
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing quotation about
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
what investments utilities are making in
 
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:15.380 align:start position:0%
their distribution system integrated
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
resource planning when done correctly
 
00:32:20.289 --> 00:32:20.299 align:start position:0%
and when subject to correct oversight
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
prevents that sort of thing from
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
happening unfortunately at least since I
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
became consumer Advocate almost exactly
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
seven years ago the puc has not been
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing the least cost planning
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
statute the old puc by which I mean
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
prior to the appointment of the current
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners treated the least
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
cost planning statute as if it were an
 
00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:44.419 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review each utilities
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
planning process as opposed to reviewing
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
the actual outcomes of the planning
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
process more recently
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
the puc has incorrectly in my view opted
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
to focus only on Capital Investments
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
instead of scrutinizing all available
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
options include though including those
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
that don't involve buying new toys and
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
the puc has treated integrated resource
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
planning as if its purpose is simply to
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
make Service as inexpensive as possible
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
instead of what the law actually says it
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
is and this goes to representative
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas's question make it as inexpensive
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
as possible while still advancing the
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
policy goals in the statute as stated in
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
RSA 378 37 two in particular that the
 
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:33.380 align:start position:0%
puc apparently doesn't like are
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
maximizing the use of cost-effective
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
and protecting health and safety of
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
people as well as the physical
 
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.009 align:start position:0%
people as well as the physical
environment

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
so when I spoke with representative
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
plett about the bill and this is
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
consistent with the testimony he just
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
gave you he asked me this question what
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
information about each utility will be
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach to you as consumer Advocate
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
if the IRP statute is repealed and the
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
answer more or less is nothing
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
but with all respect to my friend
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative plett he's asking the
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
wrong question
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
the IRP statute is not a transparency
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
regime like the right to know law it's a
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
statute that ensures or at least it
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
should ensure that the public has a
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
substantive role to play in planning the
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
future of our electric and natural gas
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
systems as well as our electric and
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
natural gas service and by the way
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
although it has been neglected by the
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
prior Witnesses the least cost planning
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
statute applies not just to our electric
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
distribution companies but to our local
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas Distribution companies
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
what I have in mind is an integrated
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
resource planning regime that offers
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
investor-owned utilities a grand bargain
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
of sorts open up democratize if you like
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
that word the planning process each
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
utility uses in exchange for
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
significantly less risk after the fact
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
of prudence related cost disallowances
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
so just to summarize I don't agree with
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
the idea that's all that's left from the
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning perspective
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
is distribution Investments I think
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of room in New Hampshire
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
law for the utilities to plan
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
holistically and the puc to review their
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
plans holistically
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with the Department of
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
energy that lease cost planning is
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
costly resource intensive and no longer
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and I especially don't agree
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
that the least cost planning
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
plan requirement is just paperwork the
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
idea is that these plans are supposed to
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
be what actually guides these utilities
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
as they decide what to do what
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
investments to make what programs to
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
offer what options to pursue this is the
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
heart of utility regulation in this
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
state it pairs nicely with rate
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
regulation after the fact integrated
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
resource planning before before the fact
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
and doing in the statute would do
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
Grievous harm to the regulatory regime
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we use to assure that the interests
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
of customers and the interests of
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
shareholders are balanced against each
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
other therefore I have a request of the
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
committee give me a bit more time to
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
work with the utilities and other
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to come up with an
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
alternative to an outright repeal of the
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
IRP statute I do think we can get there
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
although I don't fancy being cast as the
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
lone defender of integrated resource
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
planning you folks are the elected
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
officials not me and if it's your
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
pleasure to repeal the statute you can
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
let me know that sooner rather than
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
later and I won't be trying to cut
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
against the grain of the Department of
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
energy and others who favor the bill I
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
think that's all I have to say by way of
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh prepared testimony I would if it's
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's pleasure be happy to
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chris appreciate your
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
perspective I do have a quick question
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
did I hear you correctly that you said
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
that you recommend opening up the
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
planning process to the public wouldn't
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
that add a tremendous amount of
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
additional time and cost to that
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
planning process
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
well somewhat like the way we handle
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency if you involve the
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
public or stakeholders early in the
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
process it avoids the kind of protracted
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
litigation that uh my friend Mr Frantz
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
referred to before so I would say not
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily but your your question is a
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
perceptive one in that it would require
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
the utilities to think carefully uh
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
about how best to involve the public in
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
that process and and by the way I I want
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
to concede that the utilities are
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
they're the ones with the franchises
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're the ones with the service
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
obligations they're the utility I'm not
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
I do not know how to run a utility they
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
do what I do know is what priorities and
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
options I think the utilities ought to
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
pursue in the best interest of
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
residential customers and I think it
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
would be useful if the utilities had the
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
benefit of that perspective and the
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
perspective of other stakeholders as
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
they plan and again these irps are not
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be mere homework assignments
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to be the documents
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
that the utilities actually use to make
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
their resource allocation and strategic
 
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.050 align:start position:0%
their resource allocation and strategic
decisions

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions for Mr
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
Chris representative Bernardi has a
 
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.609 align:start position:0%
Chris representative Bernardi has a
question

00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Chris when
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
you started your testimony you talked
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
about utilities wanting to potentially
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
gold plate Construction Construction of
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
of facilities
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
um yet all your examples of where the
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
plan could be useful seemed to focus on
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
the distribution side including metering
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot so it seems to be a
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
disconnect as I listen to
 
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.130 align:start position:0%
disconnect as I listen to
um

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative plett's uh
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
bill which we're talking about
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminating a process that's
 
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579 align:start position:0%
focused largely and was designed to
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
focus on construction of new power
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
production facilities it also has the
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
distribution component in it but
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
am I missing something did I miss the
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
this disconnect here I I I believe with
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
respect that you are missing a few
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
things I mean one is I'll give you an
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
example from the natural gas World a few
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
years ago one of the state's two Natural
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
Gas Utilities proposed a major plan they
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to build a pipeline down the
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
route 101 Corridor and a huge tank to
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
store liquefied natural gas that would
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
have doubled the size of that company's
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
rate base and whether or not you think
 
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:02.420 align:start position:0%
that project was a good idea
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
it should have been and in fact was
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
covered in that company's least cost
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plan so there are
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
major Investments for both electric and
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas Utilities to be made in in
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
in the distribution realm uh you uh
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
keyed on my reference to meters earlier
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
utilities have tens of millions of
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
dollars uh uh if not hundreds of
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in their rate base
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
to reflect their meter Investments uh
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
and so the idea that there's nothing to
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized even if we're focusing
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
solely on distribution plant or
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
distribution Investments I I guess I
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
just disagree with that and I still
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
think that even in a uh era when the
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
utilities no longer own generation there
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
is still a place to consider the
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
generation implications of the capital
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
deployment decisions that utilities are
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
still making
 
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
I hope that was somewhat responsive
 
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.569 align:start position:0%
I hope that was somewhat responsive
follow-up

00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
so how does the utility plan for
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
distribution for a production facility
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
that they're not creating and they're
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
they're not in they're no they're not
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
the investor in they're not the producer
 
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.569 align:start position:0%
the investor in they're not the producer
uh

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
the owner of well uh just to State a
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
couple of obvious examples uh if
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
utilities made major investments in
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and by the way right
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
now they're not investing one cent in
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency that could have the
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
effect of reducing the cost to Consumers
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
that they pay to the generation
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
companies uh there's a bill that you're
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
hearing later this morning about micro
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
grids you know authorizing utilities I
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
think and other entities to commit to
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
microgrids that if deployed has the
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
effect of it has an effect on how much
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
electricity how much generation the
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
utilities have to purchase so even
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
though we have uh we we have
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
restructured the electric industry in a
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
very very significant way in the last 20
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
years but it's still one system and
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
customers still deserve a system that is
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
least cost from their perspective and if
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
the utility if the distribution utility
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the utility regulator aren't looking
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
at how can we do this in a least cost
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
way than nobody is I guarantee you ferc
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
isn't doing it I absolutely guarantee
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
you ISO New England isn't doing it and
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
so if the puc isn't doing it and our
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
local distribution companies aren't
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
doing it then nobody's doing it
 
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned it Mr crease I'm
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
going to point out to those assembled in
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
the room that house bill 558 which you
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
referred to in your answer to that last
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
question about micro grids and electric
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
grid resiliency that public hearing will
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
be open this morning but immediately
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
recessed at the request of the Bill's
 
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.010 align:start position:0%
recessed at the request of the Bill's
sponsor

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:09.020 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
joining us today
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping he can help me parse this
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
out a little bit because to be frank I
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
am still struggling I think I tend to
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
favor renewal rather than repeal one of
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
the Clauses that would be repealed if I
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
may quote from the chapters chapter 378
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
38 number four
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
an assessment of distribution and
 
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
transmission requirements is necessary
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
including an assessment of the benefits
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and costs of smart grid Technologies and
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
institution or extension of electric
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
utility programs designed to ensure a
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
more reliable and resilient grid to
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
prevent minimum outages
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
now I like all this I like it a lot and
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
I would hate to see that repealed and I
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
don't know who else would be
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
required I know it's a stack of paper
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but I'm hoping that
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
this last stack of paper they address
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
these kind of things because I don't
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
know what else they would address them
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
can you help me out with this well
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
indeed representative partial I I hope
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I think we all have a right to
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
expect that our utilities are taking all
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
of those questions and issues into
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
account regardless so the idea that the
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
IRP statute the integrated resource
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
planning statute forces the utilities to
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
do something they wouldn't otherwise do
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with that premise I mean
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
the utility should be doing those things
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
anyway with the IRP statute does is
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
requires them to account for the extent
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
to which they are doing that publicly
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
and subjects it to puc oversight that in
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
my respectful opinion is a good thing
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Don
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
I've found your your testimony and and
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
your responses here this morning to be
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
very persuasive uh but the question I
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
have for you is you you mentioned that
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
what you want the committee to do rather
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
than repeal is give you time to
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
work with the utilities to talk about
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a grand bargain where you would
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
have reformed to the IRP process in
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
exchange for greater certainty in the
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
rate making about investment recovery
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
but you earlier in your testimony said
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
that disallowance of Investments
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
almost never happens or never happens so
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of certain so do you really
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
have any um any any leverage or uh would
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
you want that leverage to be part of
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
what we might put into
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
the instructions to the I don't know if
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a joint committee or
 
00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:49.630 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a joint committee or
a

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
commission or just the process that you
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
want to engage the utilities in
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
but I guess my premise is that it would
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
be easier to prove that a utility has
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
failed to Faithfully execute its least
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
cost planning responsibilities than it
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
is to come in after the fact and say hey
 
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
utility you invested 40 million dollars
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
in AMR meters when you should have
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
invested 40 million 41 million dollars
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
in Ami meters and let's disallow that as
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
a a you know as imprudent I mean
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just a it's it's a matter
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
of what is practically possible given
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
the realities that we confront I I
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
personally my office has very good
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
relationships with the utilities and so
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of confidence in our
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
ability to collaborate effectively with
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities about their lease cost
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
planning we collaborate with the
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
utilities in a bunch of other Realms
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
already and and so I I part of my
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
advocacy is premised on the idea that
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
whatever we do by way of uh improving
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
the IRP statute would be complied with
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
by the utilities in good faith and I'm
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
confident that they would
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay we have three more people who want
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
to testify including a representative of
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
one of the utilities so we're just going
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
to take one more question here
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
question you had mentioned a couple of
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
things you said that you didn't um you
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
weren't an expert in running a utility
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
the utilities were and then you went on
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
to talk about opening up the planning
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
process so it would seem as if you're
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
talking about having either your office
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
the department of energy or the general
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
public sort of sitting in with the
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
utility working with them to develop the
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
East cost least cost plan which to me is
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't go along with the idea that
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're the utility experts and most
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
people aren't so could you kind of
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
expose on that a little bit I'm a little
 
00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:44.099 align:start position:0%
confused sure thank you for that
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
question representative Harrington I I
 
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:49.460 align:start position:0%
think that there are broad imperatives
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
that I and other stakeholders have
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
opinions about what I don't know about
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
is the engineering and technical details
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
of uh operating a utility and frankly
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
there are vast swaths of it that I don't
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
want to know I mean we're all very
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about cyber security I have no
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
idea and I shouldn't have any idea I
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest guest about how the
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
utilities ward off the very real threats
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
that no good and exposed to the security
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the grid but I do know what general
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
things I would like the utility to
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish and I would like the
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to suggest those things to
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
the utility and then I want to hear them
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
come back at me with well gosh Don those
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
are great ideas but here's why some of
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr crease I think it's
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
now time to get the utilities
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
perspective on this question and I would
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
like to hear from Michael Licata of
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
and welcome good morning uh Mike Licata
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy which if
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
memory serves starts with the letter e
 
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.250 align:start position:0%
memory serves starts with the letter e
um

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
I very much appreciate the opportunity
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
to testify before you today
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and candidly
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent of the Bill's
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
sponsor as it pertains to the lcirp
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
statute and by and large agree with a
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
great deal of what was said by
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh the individuals who have testified in
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation I think in
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
many ways uh you know the lcirp statute
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
is I actually had written Relic
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds uh Reynolds uh
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
so we are in agreement it's sort of a
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Vestige of a bygone era of when
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
utilities were vertically integrated
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
which means we were
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
either owned or responsible for the
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
provision of generation transmission and
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
distribution today the utilities by and
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
large own
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
distribution and that is the the subject
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
of state regulatory proceedings at the
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and so
 
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
because you have this statute that
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
contemplated the consideration and
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
planning around other resources and
 
00:50:27.849 --> 00:50:27.859 align:start position:0%
their integration into one another
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
it can cause a great deal of of
 
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.349 align:start position:0%
it can cause a great deal of of
confusion

00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
and inefficiency to try to Define how
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
the statute applies to the distribution
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
system today and just to give a few
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
examples I think
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know an assessment of Supply options
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh as you've heard me testify and many
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
other people testify including
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr Frantz earlier today director
 
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.770 align:start position:0%
um Mr Frantz earlier today director
France

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
France
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know our supply side options are
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we do six months
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
um load following rfps from the
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
marketplace and that is how we procure
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
default service there is the regional
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative which is
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
enshrined in statute and there is the
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
removable portfolio stat statute that
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
governs basically the the fuel mix the
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
the wrecks that we renewable energy
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
credits that we have to purchase
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
other options for Supply where if we
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
were an owner of generation and say had
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
a coal plant that was at the end of its
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
useful life and we're making a
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
determination of how and where to
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
replace that
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
would be the subject of of that
 
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.589 align:start position:0%
would be the subject of of that
discussion

00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
um similarly compliance with the Clean
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
Air Act of of 1990
 
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.190 align:start position:0%
Air Act of of 1990
um

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
if you own generation that you know
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
becomes much simpler uh evaluation if
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
you own poles and wires and substations
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
certainly there are environmental
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
impacts like every business but
 
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.890 align:start position:0%
impacts like every business but
how

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:08.900 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Clean Air Act can be
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
interpreted in many different ways by
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
many different parties which creates
 
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
confusion adds time and expense to to
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
the project and so
 
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.970 align:start position:0%
the project and so
um

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know those are just a few examples
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
of how the statute uh you know
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
gets applied or
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
inefficiently gets applied today uh to
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
the utility planning process
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
um that said I I do uh
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
support uh what the consumer Advocate
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
testified to he did reach out to us
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
after this legislation was filed and
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
asked if we would be amenable to some
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
conversations around reform to see if
 
00:52:57.609 --> 00:52:57.619 align:start position:0%
there was common ground to try to
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
address some of these issues we have
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
engaged him and other stakeholders in
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
that process I think it's been a healthy
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
exchange of ideas and respectfully asked
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
the committee to provide us and other
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
stakeholders a bit more time to see if
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's a pathway forward to make this
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
statute work a bit better and make sure
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
that there's uh understanding among the
 
00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:26.900 align:start position:0%
parties and entities that
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
participate in these these proceedings
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you know quite frankly folks being on
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
on separate pages with what is intended
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
by the statute uh and with that I'd be
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions the
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate the utility
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
perspective on this uh just proposed
 
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.530 align:start position:0%
perspective on this uh just proposed
legislation

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
I did I have a question for you I did
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
not hear the consumer Advocate suggest
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
in his testimony just what kind of
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
reforms might be proposed
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
other than kind of a broad uh
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation to open up the planning
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
process to the public
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
would the utilities feel comfortable
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
with involving
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
the public in a broad way
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
in planning how they run their business
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think um represent thank you
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the question and and I think also
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question uh
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
got at the heart of this that there's
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's a balance there
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
um that you know there are
 
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:41.780 align:start position:0%
policy decisions in any planning process
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
that are made that are informed by by
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
state policy and Regulation and I do
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
think and we've we have experience here
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire with our
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency planning we have
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
experience in in other jurisdictions
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
with grid modernization planning where
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the development of our in this case
 
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:11.540 align:start position:0%
lease cost integrated plan to uh
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
share our thinking and solicit input
 
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:18.980 align:start position:0%
from a group of stakeholders
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
as the consumer Advocates said could be
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
helpful to facilitate a more efficient
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.210 align:start position:0%
helpful to facilitate a more efficient
proceeding

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
um in the future so you know you're not
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
arguing over what is what is meant by
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
some of the statute statutory
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
requirements that there's you know
 
00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
agreement before you sort of get to to
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
an adjudicative proceeding so I I think
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
that there's a balance there between
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
obviously the utility owning and
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
operating at system but also I do think
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
that there's an opportunity for for
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
well as a follow-up I would ask let's
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more specific do you
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
think the public and stakeholders
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
stakeholders should be involved in the
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
process to plan interconnection for
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
example which is a pretty highly
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
technical aspect of utility operation
 
00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:14.030 align:start position:0%
technical aspect of utility operation
um

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:17.300 align:start position:0%
I think the engineering design of
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
interconnections to either
 
00:56:20.599 --> 00:56:22.150 align:start position:0%
interconnections to either
new

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
developments or or
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh distributed energy resources uh you
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
know that is a technical field that is
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
an operational field so uh I think the
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
evaluation of specific interconnections
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know is the purview of the
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
utility to ensure a safe and reliable
 
00:56:44.339 --> 00:56:47.270 align:start position:0%
utility to ensure a safe and reliable
system

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify you would not be in
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
favor of that part of the process being
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
opened up to stakeholders in the General
 
00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.870 align:start position:0%
opened up to stakeholders in the General
Public

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
Public
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh correct the the review of specific
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
Reinhold has a question
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
well just thank you Mr chairman
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
following up on on the Chairman's
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
question and your response I hear you
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
saying and I agree that
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
public involvement or input into the
 
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.549 align:start position:0%
public involvement or input into the
engineering

00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
specifications and requirements of
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
interconnections probably out of the
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
realm of
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
of public input but
 
00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:29.650 align:start position:0%
of public input but
um

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:29.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
interconnection decisions more broadly
 
00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
interconnection decisions more broadly
construed

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
whether to interconnect where to
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
interconnect what systems to
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
interconnect would you be open to
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
public input
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
um or and and I guess I'll expand that
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know interconnection policies and uh
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
would you be open to public input on
 
00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.349 align:start position:0%
would you be open to public input on
those

00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
well there's uh the legislature has
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
directed the department of energy to
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
open up
 
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
open up
um

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know an investigation into
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection policy I would say
 
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.250 align:start position:0%
interconnection policy I would say
standards

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
um so certainly there there is a process
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing right now to evaluate uh the the
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
process by which the utilities evaluate
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
interconnections and I think the intent
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
of that is to to achieve a level of
 
00:58:22.859 --> 00:58:24.770 align:start position:0%
of that is to to achieve a level of
standardization

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
standardization
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so that developers sort of know the
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the rules of the game regardless of what
 
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:31.700 align:start position:0%
um jurisdiction they're operating under
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh operating in so I I think that
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
there's a you know a lot of the
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
discussion around interconnection ends
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
up being on the cost and who pays for
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
the cost uh of those interconnections
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and what developers can bear so you
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
know those are policy decisions that uh
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
certainly you know the stakeholders the
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
commission uh the department of energy
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
and and the legislature has a a role in
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'll take one more question from
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative poche
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and thank you Mr
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
Lakota uh real quick
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
I got summary this is a relic
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
um others have said this utilities e or
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
chose a different meter
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
that the PCU didn't
 
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.970 align:start position:0%
that the PCU didn't
um

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
have an oversight on so my question is
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
instead of reform
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
this was a question I was going to ask a
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
previous testifier I'll ask you they
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
might come up again and
 
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.930 align:start position:0%
might come up again and
um

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
would repeal and replace be better
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
because this I'm afraid is going to go
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
we're not following it again
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
just start fresh your view thank you
 
01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:03.589 align:start position:0%
just start fresh your view thank you
um

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.849 align:start position:0%
 
I think

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:06.349 align:start position:0%
I think
um

01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
reform uh I I don't know if you want to
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
call it repeal and replace but I think
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
it requires significant changes
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
um whether that's striking and replacing
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
all or or significant amendment to
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
um I think the point of
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
the current system is not working as
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
intended and significant changes uh need
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
to be made is is uh our opinion
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're going to move on here
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh Mr locata I'm going
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
to call on Nick Krakoff from
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation I see you
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
have written testimony which is fine if
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
we could ask you to just summarize it or
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members um
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
my name is Nick Krakow from the
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation here in
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
Concord and I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
to testify um
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
as the chairman said you know I did
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony so I won't
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
summarize that but I will address a few
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised today
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost with the what the
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning statutes do
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
is they provide a big picture
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Public Utilities
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
Commission to review utility planning
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know as Mr Franz said sure there are
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
many dockets where the commission
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
reviews many of the same decisions being
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
made by the by the utilities but this is
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
the only opportunity for the Public
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to take a big
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
picture look and provide that really
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
over oversight over what the utility is
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
doing you know is it simply not possible
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
to provide that same level of oversight
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
over utility planning and across 50 50
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
or so dockets and so
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
it's a much more efficient process to
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
use this uh the integrated resource
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
planning dock is to do this
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know and as part of that I do
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
this holistic review of what a utility
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
is doing so they look at
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
um I urge you to read RSA 378-37
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
that that lays out what goes into um you
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
know what the state policy is and what
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
goes into an integrated resource plan
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if you look at that there's nothing
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
really in there that that you're not
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
going to like you know it requires plans
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be the least cost to highlight diver
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
energy diversity and protection the
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
environment and public health of the
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
state and so
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
you know without these statutes the
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is not going
 
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.870 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is not going
to

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
consider the environmental impacts of
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
utility planning again Mr Fraun said
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
well you know there's a Clean Air Act
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
and there's environmental regulations by
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
Des and whatnot but
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
there's no other opportunity for the
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission itself to
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
review the environmental impacts of
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
utility planning there simply is nothing
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
nothing else under New Hampshire law
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
that that provides the um the Public
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission with that
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity so sure Des has its own
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations but when the
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is reviewing
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that it also look at the
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of these decisions
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know we're taking a very
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
siled view of what what the utilities
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
are planning
 
01:03:22.859 --> 01:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
are planning
um

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
and so I urge you not to repeal this
 
01:03:25.559 --> 01:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
and so I urge you not to repeal this
bill

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I I agree with Mr crease and
 
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
others that there are rooms for
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
improvement and and how the planning
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
process takes place but repeal would be
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
a big mistake for New Hampshire it would
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
not provide the commission with the
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this holistic review
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
of utility planning that takes into
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
account whether a plan is lease costs
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
whether it'll provide energy diversity
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
benefits and especially right now where
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
where a lot of folks um
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know energy bills are very high you
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
know a lot of that has due to a lack of
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
energy diversity in the state and so
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
energy diversity is very important if
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
we're not taking that holistic view Rate
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
rates are rates may go up
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
um and finally you know this is not a
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
relic of the past there's there's still
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of um opportunity to to
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
employ these statutes for the public
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
interest and you know I work a lot on
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
the natural gas side which you know are
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
also subject to the integrated resource
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
planning and as Mr crease said one of
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
the Gas Utilities was was proposing a
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
450 million dollar pipeline
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's imperative that we
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
do this holistic review that the
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
commissioned this holistic review to not
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
only look at the cost but those
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and that something
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
won't take place if these this these
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
statues are repealed so I urge the
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the efforts to repeal the integrated
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
resource planning statutes and I'm happy
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
now further questions for Mr Krakow
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
Sheriff hopes and welcome uh could you
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
tell me more about the uh
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
um energy diversity implications should
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
this bill be repealed should we go ahead
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
with the repeal yeah sure well
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
you know that right now we're over
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
dependent on certain resources for for
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
heating and for power generation
 
01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
particularly natural gas you know you
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
can you can look at ISO New England's
 
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:27.980 align:start position:0%
reports and that that's backed up and so
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
you know if there are options to to
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
avoid Reliance on that you know increase
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
energy storage microgrids increase
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency to avoid increased
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
Reliance on those resources
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know we should be exploring that
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
and without the integrated resource
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
plans there won't be an opportunity to
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.849 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
no

01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions we
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and ask Meredith Hatfield to
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
give us her perspective on this
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos members of the committee
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield for The Nature
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
Conservancy as someone who's had the
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
privilege of practicing before the puc
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
for a couple decades now I just wanted
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
to share my perspective and try not to
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
repeat many of the things that the
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate said because we do
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
agree with many of his points we do
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
support reform not repeal and I would
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
respectfully commend to the committee
 
01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:37.700 align:start position:0%
that you take a careful look at RSA
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
37837 which this bill would repeal
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
and that is the New Hampshire energy
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
policy guidance that is provided to the
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
puc which other speakers have referred
 
01:06:47.819 --> 01:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
puc which other speakers have referred
to

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
but it does say that it is the energy
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
policy of this state to meet the energy
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
needs of the citizens and businesses of
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
the state at the lowest reasonable cost
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
while providing for the reliability and
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy resources it goes on
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
to discuss as Mr crease said Energy
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
Efficiency demand side resources safety
 
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.390 align:start position:0%
Efficiency demand side resources safety
health

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
and the future supplies of our resources
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
and as several other speakers have
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is no other opportunity
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
currently to have that bigger picture
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
conversation so I would be happy to
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
participate in discussions regarding how
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
to improve the statute I certainly think
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
it can be improved one idea I wanted to
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
mention is that some states do a
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
Statewide IRP process so that instead of
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
having to do a separate process with
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
each distribution utility
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
utilities come together and file their
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
own versions of an IRP but stakeholders
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the public are able to review them
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
together which I think might be more
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
efficient these proceedings are already
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
open to the public and I think that
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's a really important aspect of
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
requiring these plans is that anyone who
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
is interested those who represent
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
various consumers and developers and
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
others can participate in and I think
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's a really important part of the
 
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
that's a really important part of the
process

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
and at a time when the state is seeking
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
serious questions uh answers to serious
 
01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:20.179 align:start position:0%
questions around pricing of energy
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
access to new resources access to
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
Advanced metering
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
um how we get customers to be able to
 
01:08:30.849 --> 01:08:30.859 align:start position:0%
take advantage of time varying rates
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
grid modernization which I believe is
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
still languishing in a docket that was
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
started in 2015. we have we do have a
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
lot of important questions before us and
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
these proceedings are the place to do
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
that I do think it definitely could be
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
improved I've been in many of these
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
proceedings and they can be frustrating
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
so certainly there's there's room for
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
improvement but I would respectfully
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
submit that they are not a relic that
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
planning and stepping back from a from
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
only being in dockets where utility is
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
asking for rate recovery is actually a
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
really important tool
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
in the IRP dockets are the place where
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
you can do that
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your perspective on this
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation questions from the
 
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation questions from the
committee

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams I didn't see
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
your hand thank you chair Vos um and
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Hadfield for your testimony
 
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Hadfield for your testimony
today

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I would be interested to hear what
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
you think reform would look like if
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
there is something that you would
 
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.430 align:start position:0%
there is something that you would
recommend

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
um you know I I do think that while the
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
statute as Mr Franz hopefully reviewed
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
has been around for a long time
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
um and you know was originally intended
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
to look at the supply side if you look
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
at the filings today there's I think
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
typically a section where the utility
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
says you know we deal with Supply
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
differently now because we're fully
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
um deregulated so I I do think we could
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
go through the statute perhaps remove
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
the reference to the Clean Air Act
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
because that that doesn't seem to be
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
super relevant today and I think there
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
are other ways that we could
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
modernize the requirements of the
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
utilities the things that they should be
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the data they should be
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
providing so I certainly think and we
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
could possibly look to other states and
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
how they approach it
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it would be an
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging effort bless you
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
um to to go through and make the statute
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
more more useful for everyone thank you
 
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.669 align:start position:0%
more more useful for everyone thank you
okay

01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
one more question representative muns
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
coming in just just a quick follow-up to
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that question
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
what what would the the in your
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
estimation the time frame for being able
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
to do that I mean is that something that
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
could be done over this course of the
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
summer is that something that you know
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
is going to require you know maybe a
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
little longer
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative munz I think
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
what what I heard from those who
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
testified previously is is a very strong
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
willingness to come together right now
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
and bring something back to you so so I
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
would think that we we would be able to
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
do that in the short term
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you we're gonna
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
move on we have three more bills to hear
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
before the lunch break and so I'm going
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on House
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 281.
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
and open a public hearing on House Bill
 
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.689 align:start position:0%
and open a public hearing on House Bill
298.

01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
298.
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call the prime sponsor
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh we'll get the blue sheet information
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill later
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call the prime sponsor of
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation representative
 
01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:01.219 align:start position:0%
Lucius partial to introduce the bill
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
and you owe me a pink card you're right
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you chair and
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
my impression is we will have more than
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
a few people wishing to testify and that
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
most of us on this committee are
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
familiar with what does at stake here
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
either through legislation brought last
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
year or discussions in caucus
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
with few exceptions I think you also
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
have a loose consensus on this matter
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
um so let's do a few quick comments 5G
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
is generally not wanted in our community
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
it depresses property values and raises
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
numerous environmental concerns
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
thanks to the FCC mandates 5c
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
contributes little to Municipal tax
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
rolls presently
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
we have enacted rsas designed to address
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of these challenges and I've
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
alluded them in my written testimony
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
which I did email to the committee
 
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
which I did email to the committee
earlier

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh while there's a a risk and
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
while there is risk or not in the
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
Broadband application of 5G technology
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
and we uh and I doubt will come up with
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
all the answers today
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
however the difference in deploying such
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
things as Wi-Fi my home and flooding my
 
01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
municipality with 5G is obvious one is
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
my personal decision to assume some risk
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
against perceived benefit the other
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
subjects all residents with a
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
municipality to a set of risks willing
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
or no
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
rather in view of the process in which
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
our committee decides to decide that
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
more legislation is better is needed I
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
will defer to those who wish to give
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
testimony for that reason I will end my
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
 
01:13:57.179 --> 01:14:02.270 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
partial

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank you for
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
and call forward the next person who
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this bill with
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Denise ricciardi and Senator
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
richardi we welcome you to sdne nice to
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
see you again nice to see you too good
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair and esteemed colleagues
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your consideration
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 298 for the record I'm
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
Denise rashardi the state senator for
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
District 9 which spans from Bedford up
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
to Hinsdale
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk a little bit about why
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm before you
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
a few years back Governor sununu had
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
appointed me to the 5G study commission
 
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:50.300 align:start position:0%
but what happened is it morphed into
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
more of the RF frequencies and it it
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
just morphed into something else so what
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
the commission quickly discovered is
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
that with the federal Telecommunications
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
Act of 1996 the federal legislature gave
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
the ultimate power over states and their
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities when it comes to citing
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
issues it also
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh the FCC in partnership with the other
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that set acceptable
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
levels of RF radiation that can be
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
emitted from these sites
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
this law and the rules that followed
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
have confused municipalities as they
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
intend to have meaningful say inciting
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
decisions for many decades now
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
communities across New Hampshire are
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
fighting back to regain some control of
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
this process but in a way that does not
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
violate federal law
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to give New
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipalities more say
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
inciting decisions the approach set
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
forth in this bill is based upon the
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what seems to work and not
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
work as Community struggle with this
 
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.070 align:start position:0%
work as Community struggle with this
issue

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
I can tell you a week does not go by
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
that a constituent doesn't call me all
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
over our state asking for help with this
 
01:16:15.719 --> 01:16:17.810 align:start position:0%
over our state asking for help with this
situation

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.010 align:start position:0%
situation
um

01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the state the people in the state of New
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have a right to know that all
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
safety codes are followed when it comes
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
to cell towers and transmitting small
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
cell antennas especially in light of the
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
over 800 000 such Wireless facilities
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
the FCC is estimating will be needed for
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
new technologies so I want to stop a
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
minute and say this is not any intent or
 
01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
intention to stop technology we're just
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
trying to give municipality some rights
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
on placement and we want safe
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
sustainable technology
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does three important things it
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
supports local authorities New
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's cities and towns in ensuring
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
that telecommunication networks meet
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
applicable codes
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
are appropriately located and most
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
importantly does not result in our
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
authorities being liable for damages
 
01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:19.460 align:start position:0%
this is about safety responsibility
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
citing and liability
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire should
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
be afforded as much Authority as
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
possible regarding Wireless facilities
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill is a very modest and
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
thoughtful step pending the energy
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
Department's development of a model
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the associated rulemaking
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
they are already charged to do that that
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
to do so for those of you who don't know
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the energy department is
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
to develop a model ordinance has
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
recently come to my attention
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
12-k 8 deployment of personal wireless
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
service facilities and under model
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances and guidance States the
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of energy
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
shall develop a set model Municipal
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
ordinances relative to the deployment of
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
personal Wireless communication
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
facilities prior to development the
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
director shall hold one or more public
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearings and solicit comments from
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
interested parties the department of
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
energy shall provide a copy of the set
 
01:18:28.209 --> 01:18:28.219 align:start position:0%
of model ordinances to any New Hampshire
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
municipality that requests it
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
I imagine most people think that um
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
over the course of the Tower and
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
wireless facility applicants must show
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
proof of meeting national state and
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
local safety codes including fire codes
 
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
but they do not
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
k-112 B says it does not prevent local
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
authorities from enforcing building code
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 298 requires that the
 
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
Wireless company demonstrate compliance
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the application from a licensed
 
01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.250 align:start position:0%
in the application from a licensed
engineer

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
that way if there is no upfront proof
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
the local Authority can give notice of
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
deficiency and stop the shot clock so
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
this bill supplements and facilitates
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
local Authority on these codes
 
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
as we learned last session for those of
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
you who were here in hearings on the
 
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
you who were here in hearings on the
proposed

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
1640 foot setback for wireless
 
01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.689 align:start position:0%
1640 foot setback for wireless
facilities

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
well some major why wildfires out west
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
were started by Wireless and electrical
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
equipment on poles for example in Malibu
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
California a poll loaded with antennas
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
of three Wireless carriers snapped
 
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
ignited the grass resulting in the
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
Malibu cannon fire which burned over six
 
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
square miles
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
the Nasi hardening requirements provide
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate site conditions and
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
characteristics for wireless sites to
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
withstand things like severe storm
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
earthquakes tornadoes and other
 
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.689 align:start position:0%
earthquakes tornadoes and other
disasters

01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
second house bill 298 this bill ensures
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
that a wireless facility will not
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
significantly affect historical or
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive areas and this
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
is fully within localities authority to
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
consider appropriate location Wireless
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
installations should be responsibly
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
the sites need to withstand the
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
onslaught of natural man-made conditions
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
and consider the distinct requirements
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
for different Geographic locations
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
including the likelihood to be subject
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
by severe storms or earthquakes HB 298
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
concerns the liability issue so that the
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
low low calories are not stuck holding
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
the bag taxpayers should not be stuck
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
this bill allows planning boards to hold

Wireless facilities
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
the planning board can also require if
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
it chooses that the Apple can carry
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
adequate liability coverage including
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%

01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
our communities the reason pollution
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
Insurance could be needed is that the
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation emitted from
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
cell towers and small cell wireless
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
network antennas is generally defined as
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
pollution even by the Wireless company
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
insurance policies for cell phones
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
themselves so for example at T Mobile
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
insurance and Verizon total mobile
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
protection on ATT it's on page four for
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
them and on Verizon page 10 state that
 
01:21:59.290 --> 01:21:59.300 align:start position:0%
coverage is excluded for pollutants
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
pollutants is defined as any solid
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
liquid gases or thermal irritant or
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
contaminant including smoke Vapor soot
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
fumes acid chemicals artificially
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
produced electric Fields magnetic field
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic field sound waste
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
microwaves and all artificially produced
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
ionizing or non-ionizing radiation and
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
waste many general liability insurance
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
plans have very clear electromagnetic
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
field exclusions for health or other
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
damages from long-term exposure to radio
 
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
damages from long-term exposure to radio

01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
I served on the New Hampshire Commission
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
on 5G health and environment and our
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
final report issued 15 recommendations
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
after more than a year of Investigation
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
into these issues
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
and I again want to reiterate that I am
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
contacted regularly by people who want
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
tougher laws related to this issue
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
they're concerned and they want safety
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
and they want enforcement they want a
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
calendar accountability and they want
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire to come
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
first this is a very modest bill it's
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
important and critical step in this
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
direction there is a lot of work we can
 
01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
do in the state in regards to this issue
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
so in short the bill provides the New
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipalities with the tools
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
to work with the Telecommunications
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
industry in a collaborative manner to
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of the communities in
 
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
our Granite State
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you represent uh Senator rather
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
all the same almost forgot for your
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill representative
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question for you thank you
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you senator for taking
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
um so uh just to be clear does this bill
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
give municipalities
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
more information to look at if if
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to decide to allow a tower
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
to build in there in in their area or
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
does it uh give them more Authority uh
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
such like the puc might have for
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
sighting in the in the particular area
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not well versed in that aspect of
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
it which which one of those two does
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
this give thank you for the question
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
what it does is it gives Clarity to the
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are confused because
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
often the industry
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
tells them that that they have no say
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
and they really do what it also does is
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
offer protections that they currently
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh in other words it it
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
gives them
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
more regulations if you will that they
 
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
can go back on if they decided either
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
for or against having them put the tower
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
there correct it will give them more
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
Authority but again it's always
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
important to remember without violating
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
Senator uh so you mentioned in your
 
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's to be a model
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
ordinance prepared uh yet I I don't see
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
that in the uh in the bill that's in
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
front of us yes can you point it isn't
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
it isn't in the this bill but it was it
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
was in a bill uh it was in before it was
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh let's see the director of the
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy it was 12k8 I
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
believe this was
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
um established after the 5G committee
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
um completed their report that took
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
place after so it's not in this bill
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's already in
 
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
it's already in
um

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:52.100 align:start position:0%
12-k and 12-10
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
K10 and this will afford a wonderful
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Department of energy
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
to proceed with the bill uh it was
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
referenced in in that original bill that
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
it uses the word shall in the
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the Department of
 
01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.129 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the Department of
energy

01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
so it's not in the current bill because
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
it has already been passed
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
did I answer that okay for you okay
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you uh rep Senator
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you as you read
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
this bill as you understand its language
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
line six of the bill
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
talks about adequate proof
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
by a licensed engineer
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
regarding an application to cite one of
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
can you tell me does the does the phrase
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
adequate proof
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
introduce some ambiguity into this
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
process I mean what's adequate for you
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
may not be adequate for her
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
is that a possibility and should we
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
consider a amendment to tighten up that
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
language uh thank you for the question
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
what it we could do that but to explain
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
a little bit more right now
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to fire code they don't
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
have to use this engineer so this bill
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
is trying to say that we need an
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
engineer but I'm uh the sponsor of the
 
01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.450 align:start position:0%
engineer but I'm uh the sponsor of the
bill

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
um may want to consider tightening up
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
if it is helpful to you
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you representative
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.570 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
chair

01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
um on lines uh 22 and 23 where it says
 
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
the facilities and their operation will
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
not significantly affect historical or
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive areas that
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
sounds rather broad to me um can you
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
tell me how that would be measured and
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
what criteria would be used to determine
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
impact thank you
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I'm going to defer to
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
a different expert on that is that okay
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas keep that
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
question close by so that you can ask it
 
01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
to someone else uh representative
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
Summers has a question
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh first I must
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
state to the committee that I'm uh into
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
the record that I'm a founder and CEO of
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
a network engineering company secondly
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
that company is also a member of Bia
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
and my question is is uh for this
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
testimony I actually uh turned on my hot
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
spot and I have my Bluetooth running so
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
right now I'm facilitating 2.4 gigahertz
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
of self-service to everybody in the room
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm also facilitating five gigahertz to
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room and representative
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
if I could just uh interrupt you
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
remember you want your questions to be
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
about the subject the language of the
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
whatever your question is Target it at
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill please I sure
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
will since right now I am a personal
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
wireless service facilitator
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't it wasn't my cell phone was
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
not operated by a licensed engineer and
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
there I don't have insurance as well
 
01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
would that make me in violation of this
 
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.090 align:start position:0%
would that make me in violation of this
bill

01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
I would have to say that this is about
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
the sighting of so if
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill would like to
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
speak to that or to clear clear that
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
language up but this is not about your
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
usage of your phone or anything of that
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
nature this is about the site the
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
application and the citing of when the
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
tower would be implemented or projected
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
to be implemented
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
um can you point out where it says Tower
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
could you point in the bill I don't see
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
anywhere where it says siding or Tower
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna make a comment and then defer
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor on that I really really
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear uh given your
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
position and what you stated about the
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bia is that this is not to
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
stop change take away any technology
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is just about giving the
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities the opportunity to have
 
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
some Protections in place and have some
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
authority over their sighting
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
um but I will let the sponsor of the
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill follow up with you if that's okay
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you senator
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
um I I you know when I read when I read
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
the bill it looks like what this is
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
addressing is two things one is the
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
structural Integrity of the actual Tower
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
which is what Clause one gets to
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
section two gets at the environmental
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
impact and I just want to make sure that
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
I understand when when you when the when
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
when we're referring to environmental
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
impact that typically has to do with you
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
know impact on Wetlands uh that that
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
um you know what is the debt what is
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
your definition of environmental impact
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
is it that is it that type of thing or
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
are we somehow getting into the area of
 
01:31:26.169 --> 01:31:26.179 align:start position:0%
microwave emissions
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna let the sponsor speak to his
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
bill on that I think that's more
 
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.850 align:start position:0%
bill on that I think that's more
appropriate

01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay further questions from uh
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are other people who want
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
to testify that might be able to address
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
so Senator I know you are an extremely
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
busy lady so we'll let you get back to
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
your regular duties and we thank you for
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
testifying thank you very much and I
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate your consideration in
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
passing HB 298 thank you and have a
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful day thank you you too

next up let's hear from
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%

Mr Fabrizio welcome to sdne thank you
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
and good morning everyone uh Mr chairman
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%

nonpartisan business advocate
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
Bia opposes House Bill 298 because of
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
its potential to block new transmitters
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this is at odds
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
with what state residents want and may
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
run a file the federal
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%

a Harris poll of New Hampshire

registered voters commissioned by ctia
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
found 78 percent of Voters support
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
Mobile Wireless upgrades in their
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%

installation of small cell antennas
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
which are essential for 5G deployment
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislation passed last year and New
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ramps up the state's historic
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
investment in broadband and cell
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
coverage expansion to eliminate gaps to
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
benefit individuals
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
communities and the New Hampshire
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
economy HB 298 ignores that
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
additional local environmental and
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
historic preservation reviews are
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
redundant to State and FCC mandated
 
01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.330 align:start position:0%
redundant to State and FCC mandated
reviews

01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
reviews
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
the Bill's standard for local
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
environmental review is boundless and
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
there'd be little basis to challenge a
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
site modification denial given its
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited scope
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will lead to
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
requirements that vary by town city town
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
city making compliance more expensive
 
01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
with those additional costs borne by
 
01:33:52.739 --> 01:33:53.930 align:start position:0%
with those additional costs borne by
consumers

01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
even worse it could stop the expansion
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
of Wireless services in the state
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
local control is certainly to be an
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
issue considered with this bill but
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
consider that the New Hampshire office
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
of strategic initiatives States local
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
boards do have a great deal of influence
 
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
over proposed Wireless facilities but
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
they must be proactive and they must
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
remain within Federal Telecommunications
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
Act guidelines
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
section 704 of the ACT preserves local
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
zoning authority over the placement
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
construction and modification of
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
personal wireless service facilities
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
with limitations particularly stating
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
they shall not prohibit
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh or have the effect of prohibiting the
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
provision of Wireless uh personal
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
Wireless services
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
on the APCO point
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
the Bill's requirement to comply with
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
Association of Public Safety
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
Communications official standards
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
standards is inappropriate for cell
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
transmitters especially small cell sites
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
the APCO standard provides guidelines
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
for large Public Safety networks to be
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
built to withstore withstand storms and
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and doesn't generally
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
apply to commercial wireless networks
 
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
and even APCO establishes limits stating
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
the high cost associated with meeting
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
these requirements may not be feasible
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
at all sites in HB 298 ignores this
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the end HB 298 appears designed to
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
have the effect of prohibiting their
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
provision of personal Wireless Services
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
even as New Hampshire invests in a
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunication system needed for
 
01:35:44.209 --> 01:35:44.219 align:start position:0%
safety and economic success HP 298 is
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary its language is unreasonable
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
and counterproductive and it should be
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
defeated I'll be happy to take any
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Fabrizio representative
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Fabrizio for
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you stated that 78

percent of Voters support Mobile

Wireless upgrades uh
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
do they also support structural

Integrity standards do they also support
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
um making sure that historical and
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts are taken into
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
account you would there would have to be
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
a con Paul conducted specific to that
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
issue the poll speaks to and I don't
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a surprise to anyone that
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
residences State largely would like to
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
see improved telecommune and improved
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunications system and whether
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
you do the poll or you simply understand
 
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
that when you leave a heavily populated
 
01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.390 align:start position:0%
that when you leave a heavily populated
area

01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
your cell service is soon in question
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
and in this day and age with uh remote
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
work with Telehealth Services the
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
broadening of how we communicate New
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
 
01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
verizio

01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
verizio
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh I asked this the senator
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
about the model ordinance and so I'm
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to ask you the the same thing uh
 
01:37:18.729 --> 01:37:18.739 align:start position:0%
or a related
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh issue real relatively concerned so if
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
these standards are embedded into a
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
model ordinance so that throughout the
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
state you have a a uniform application
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
of them would that would that not
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
ameliorate some of your concerns
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
at the surface level yes however it
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
depends on which standards that are
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and how they're
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
Incorporated I go back to the APCO
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
standards that are designed for a very
 
01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:51.179 align:start position:0%
specific type of you know a public
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
safety and e911 type of system they're
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
not applicable to small cell uh
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
transmitters it's to harden them against
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
storms and natural disasters it's it's
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
not the same scale so whether or not
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
that goes in
 
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's most important in the in the FCC
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
section of it it it does state that
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
there is local control in this but I'll
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
go to the notes on that that
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
um according to the FCC communities are
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
best served by having an ongoing
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
planning process led by a local Regional
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunications committee a municipal
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
master plan should include a
 
01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.179 align:start position:0%
telecommunications section and the
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
community could identify locations where
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
facilities should or should not be using
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the help of an engineer or industry
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative it's most important for
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
the communities to be proactive so
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
potentially having the effect of
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
stopping the deployment of personal
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
wireless service facilities because that
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
would run a file of the
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act
 
01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:58.430 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act
follow-up

01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the appsco APCO
 
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.649 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the appsco APCO
standard

01:39:02.649 --> 01:39:02.659 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
if it's not in their own regulations if
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a applicable it's hard to
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
understand how it's going to be embedded
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
in a model ordinance
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that do you have the same it was news
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
to me today about the development of
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
this model ordinance
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
should that be the case one would have
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
to pause to consider whether this
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
legislation should Advance before that
 
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh work is done
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
because we at this point we don't really
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
know what the model ordinance would be
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
and we certainly haven't had an
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have public comment on it
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
um going to the um the lines there four
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
five six and seven when it talks about
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
these reviews being done by a licensed
 
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
engineer do you have any idea what the
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
time and cost would be involved to go
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
through all those codes and certify that
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
this particular application uh met all
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
the requirements no I I do not
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I do know that our our members vested
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
in this issue are concerned about
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
um with the duplicative reviews with
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
additional points of review that
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
compliance is going to be more expensive
 
01:40:25.129 --> 01:40:25.139 align:start position:0%
and more burdensome it's going to cause
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
delays all of which is going to increase
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
cost for installation and all of those
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
costs are going to be passed on to
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
Consumers follow-up follow-up moving
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
down to line 19 I read this a number of
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
times maybe you're not the right person
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
to ask but since you're here I'm going
 
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:41.540 align:start position:0%
to ask you
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
inform itself of the environmental
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
impact of any proposed personal Wireless
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
services and goes on with this uh you
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
know except for radio frequency emission
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
inform who is itself in this case
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
I would ask the Bill's sponsor on that
 
01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:00.179 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
Fabrizio nice to see you again after so
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
many years who who knew we would see
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
each other again in this uh setting
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
there was always a chance
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
um it when I when I read your when I
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
read your testimony the third the
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph the third paragraph from the
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
bottom uh where you you you talk about
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
the environmental review is boundless I
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
mean you you seem to have a a similar
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
concern to what I had expressed earlier
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
about you know the what is the
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
definition of environmental impact right
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
can you can you talk and I'm
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
specifically interested in
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier I mean are we talking
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
about you know environmental impact in
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
the traditional sense of impact on
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
Wetlands or are we talking about
 
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
something that is that includes other
 
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:54.500 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.149 align:start position:0%
things like
microwaves

01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
microwaves
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative munz and I know each
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
other from my previous career as a
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
journalist uh on the Seacoast which I
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
had done for 24 years and really had
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
covered local developmental issues I
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
could say on that point of what
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
qualifies as environmental or what
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
qualifies this historic preservation is
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
virtually Limitless for those who want
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
to cite a particular issue yes Wetlands
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's an obvious one uh site
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
degradation is another one uh beyond
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
that when you you could get into animal
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
species it's it's literally in this case
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
boundless as to what someone could raise
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
as an environmental or even a historic
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
preservation concern and I would remind
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
again that both of those cell providers
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
anyone looking to put in a personal
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
wireless service facility is already
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
subject to those reviews uh through the
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
FCC and those reviews are specifically
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
the National Environmental Policy Act
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the National Historic preservation
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
Act all of them have to go through those
 
01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
Act all of them have to go through those

01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has another
 
01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:07.129 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has another
question

01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's uh Doug Thomas
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
my question so uh given the statement
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the federal government
 
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:16.970 align:start position:0%
that the federal government
um

01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
I guess regulation says that a
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
municipality Can't Stop
 
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
the placement of Wireless features per
 
01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:26.109 align:start position:0%
the placement of Wireless features per
se

01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
se
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
where where in this bill does it
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
give the authority to the municipalities
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
that would prevent that instead of just
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps suggesting it should be placed
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
in a different direction or a different
 
01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.209 align:start position:0%
in a different direction or a different
place

01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
well to uh be specific the language from
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
the FCC is to say shall not prohibit or
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
have the effect of prohibiting it means
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
overall it doesn't mean that communities
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to say that's the
 
01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:00.860 align:start position:0%
wrong site it's that you cannot develop
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
rules regulations ordinances that simply
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
ban the location or co-location of these
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
personal wireless service facilities as
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
far as the language and the Bill of
 
01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:15.860 align:start position:0%
where it allows the primary concern is
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
the language May in fact allow
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
communities to reach that point where
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're prohibiting the installation
 
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
across the board and not site-specific
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
again because the vagaries related to
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
both the environmental and historic
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
preservation reviews
 
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
therefore it seems like perhaps a
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
softening of the words or some Amendment
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
might alleviate some of your concerns
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think that if the amendment was
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps more driven by what is spelled
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
out by the FCC and the New Hampshire uh
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
office for strategic initiatives Again
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
by being proactive by having it be part
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the master plan of being able to say
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
where they can be located where they
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
cannot be located would remove some of
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
the subjectivity of this bill that is
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
the primary concern of the members who
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
for clarification I would point out that
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives no
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
longer exists and its duties have been
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
split up between the department of
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
energy and the business and
 
01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.250 align:start position:0%
energy and the business and
economic

01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs Department
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
might not have gotten the title
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
department exactly that the previous
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
positions of the office are informing
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
the department of Energy's model
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
ordinance approach
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to move on we now have
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
five uh thank you everyone people who
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this
 
01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:56.750 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this
legislation

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
before we do that I'm going to open a
 
01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:02.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
558 FN relative to electric microgrids
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
and electric grid resiliency
 
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
and recess that public hearing until
 
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
next week at a dime at a time to be
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll now move on to the
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
next presenter on House Bill 298 and
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
that is Cecilia Doucette of Ashland New
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
M.A for safe technology
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
I think I got that right and Ms Doucette
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
I would remind you that we're not
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing a rehash of the
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
findings of the commission on 5G
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're not interested particularly in
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
hearing about the health effects we're
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing about how this
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
specific legislation will affect
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire and the
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%

report
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the commission to study the
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
environmental and health effects of
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
evolving 5G Technologies I encourage all
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
of you to get familiar with at least the
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
first 17 pages of the summary and
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations they spent a year
 
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:05.390 align:start position:0%
recommendations they spent a year
investigating

01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
today House Bill 298 addresses the
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
commission's recommendation number seven
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
to safeguard New Hampshire communities
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
with responsibly placed cell towers
 
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
antennas and 5G small cell equipment
 
01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
while the industry has told many
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities that they do not have a
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
say in where cell towers go that simply
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
is not true but our towns don't know it
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are many Provisions towns can
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
legally codify under current federal law
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
to protect their communities and HB 298
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
incorporates many of them one important
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
point from last session is that the FCC
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
has been sued for ignoring 11 000 pages
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
of scientific evidence of harm and the
 
01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:53.750 align:start position:0%
of scientific evidence of harm and the
attorney

01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
who gave the oral arguments in that case
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
wrote the bylaw or the bill that's
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
before you today so he knows exactly
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
what you can and cannot do under federal
 
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.910 align:start position:0%
what you can and cannot do under federal
law

01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
there are resources readily available to
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire succeed the
 
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
non-profit Americans for responsible
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%

01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
Nationwide to adopt protective zoning
 
01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:22.940 align:start position:0%

Encinitas California and Ithaca New York
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
and others
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
they have also developed this checklist
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
they have a smart planning provision for
 
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.490 align:start position:0%
they have a smart planning provision for
municipalities

01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
a sample code that your department of
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
energy could start with
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
every town is welcome to use these now
 
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
while the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
energy fulfills its mandate under Title
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
1 chapter 12 dash k
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
to develop a set of model ordinances as
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
Senator richardi indicated and in your
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
paperwork there today I've actually
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
given you a copy of what the current
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
statue is so that you can look at it and
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
you can read where the department of
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
energy under sections eight and nine
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
are mandated to provide sample
 
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'll give you a moment to look at
 
01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:32.149 align:start position:0%
okay I'll give you a moment to look at
that

01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
and that does actually ask that the
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:41.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
there are many other resources the
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
department of energy can tap into and as
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
we saw through the commission process
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
there are World leading Engineers
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
Telecom experts scientists and doctors
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
at the ready to help New Hampshire give
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
the power back to their local
 
01:50:58.619 --> 01:51:00.229 align:start position:0%
the power back to their local
municipalities

01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
and for for those of you and I know some
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
of you this comes way out of left field
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
on this topic today we are partnering
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire for safe technology
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
to provide two free public educational
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
webinars every month we have people all
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
over the U.S all over the granite state
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
and even from Europe and Canada joining
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
us to learn what are the facts on this
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
issue and what can we do to ensure if we
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
choose to we use our personal property
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
safely but also to make sure our
 
01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
communities are protected and please get
 
01:51:39.609 --> 01:51:39.619 align:start position:0%
back to the bill itself thank you yeah
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
so lastly the international nonprofit
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
Wireless education has built a simple
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
course to train municipalities and
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
workforces on wireless risks and safer
 
01:51:52.129 --> 01:51:52.139 align:start position:0%
Technology Solutions in about a half an
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
hour online so we are at the ready to
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire the education
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
component was one additional piece that
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
your commit he voted 15-3 last session
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
that they would like to see moving
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
forward so I would be happy to answer
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you very much
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'll just ask the
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked before in
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
line 19 of the bill it starts out inform
 
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
itself of the environmental impact
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
learning proposed personal wireless
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
service who is itself in this case the
 
01:52:28.679 --> 01:52:31.070 align:start position:0%
service who is itself in this case the
municipality

01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow up so the town is supposed to
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
do some kind of research and come to a
 
01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.729 align:start position:0%
do some kind of research and come to a
conclusion

01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
to itself that there is outside of radio
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
frequency emissions that's that's under
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
the fcc's controlled that the facilities
 
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
and operation will not significantly
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
affect historical or environmentally
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas and I guess I would
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
repeat the kind of the previous question
 
01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
that seems so wide open that you know
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
someone could say a tel a cell tower
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
across from a cemetery is a historic
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
Cemetery so we we don't want to have to
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
look at it when we bury people or
 
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it doesn't do you think that
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
needs a little more tightening up or
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
those con those conversations should
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps happen within the community so
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
that the community determines the most
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate placement of any
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment and by the
 
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
way when you look at that commission
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
report they recognize that wireless is
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
no longer advanced technology
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
future-proof technology is fiber optics
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
to and through the premises not more
 
01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
Wireless build out so it is imperative
 
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:41.699 align:start position:0%
that our communities be taught that they
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
have legal recourse when the industry
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
comes in and says we're putting in a
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
cell tower in section 704 of the Telecom
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
Max says you can't say anything about it
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
because there's so much more that
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
Congress intended to empower our
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities than what the industry
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and just uh to go
 
01:54:07.129 --> 01:54:07.139 align:start position:0%
back to clarify basically what I was
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
asking them can I ask you kind of the
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
same thing is that in this bill it
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually State the word tower or
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
5G so if for example Topsfield Fair in
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you're probably Familiar
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
of they have wireless access points all
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
over their entire entire area and
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting on polls all over
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
there broadcasting wireless access would
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
they fall under this statute if they
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
this was in place
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
I would defer that you look to the title
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
one law here and it has the definitions
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's correct the
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation before us amends
 
01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.629 align:start position:0%
legislation before us amends
section

01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
12 RSA 12K section 10 but there are
 
01:54:59.689 --> 01:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
other sections
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
of that legislation which you very
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully passed out to us that show
 
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully passed out to us that show
that

01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
essentially this entire section is about
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
governing deployment of personal wild
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
Wireless services so thank you for that
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
clarification representative munz has a
 
01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.550 align:start position:0%
clarification representative munz has a
question

01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
for being here this uh this morning I
 
01:55:24.649 --> 01:55:24.659 align:start position:0%
have been struggling with the wording in
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
lines 20 through 22 in the bill where it
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
talks about other than with regard to
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
environmental effects or radio frequency
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
emissions that are consistent with FCC
 
01:55:36.649 --> 01:55:36.659 align:start position:0%
regards yeah
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and I'll ask you and and if you can't
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
answer that's fine
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
my reading of that is that what it is
 
01:55:46.209 --> 01:55:46.219 align:start position:0%
saying what this Bill is saying is that
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
essentially that the local Authority
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
um any the local entity does not have
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
any authority over anything regarding
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
radio frequency Transmissions is that
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
correct that would be easy to see how
 
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
you would think that however there are
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
many many Provisions that legally you
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
can do in your towns the FCC when they
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
allowed the industry to heavily
 
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
influence the writing of the Telecom Act
 
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
of 1996 they did put in section 704 that
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
clause about
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um basically if you have any concerns
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
about the environment you're out of luck
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
because you can't sue us
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
but there are many other Provisions that
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
Congress did allow that can be used
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
today by your towns to protect and the
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
reason why you really want to do this
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
now is that 5G means putting close range
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
cell towers people in Keene testified
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
last time they are literally putting
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
them in their front yards
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
and if you don't get your fire codes
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
right if you don't get the other codes
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
right and have an engineer certify that
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
when the industry submits that
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
application that it was done right you
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
could wind up with a cell tower in your
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
front yard and if you have a fire and
 
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
that comes down with radio frequency
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
radiation you can't just call
 
01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
and get a fire truck and start hosing
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
that thing down they have to communicate
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
with the electrical authorities get the
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
power cut or the person holding the hose
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
is going to get electrocuted and we had
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
an expert with Susan Foster testify last
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
session on that so that fire code
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
Edition and the other additions that are
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
in that bill are critically important
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wendy Thomas has a
question

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair as you testified if
 
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
the towns can do this now but they don't
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
know about it is this bill necessary or
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
is this an education issue
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
I would say this bill is necessary
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
because our towns simply don't know and
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
they've only been given disinformation
 
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
by the industry and a lot of people are
 
01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
getting sick from the radio frequency
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
radiation so we need to do something
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful now the commission Bill law
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
HB 522 was passed in 2019 and here we
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
are in 2023 and we have not done one
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
thing to educate or protect the children
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
the adults and the environment
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to thank you for being
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
available to testify to us
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
is there any an additional question
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington thank you
 
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and and
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
don't get the wrong way but I'm just
 
01:58:40.609 --> 01:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the the thought
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
behind this bill we've been dealing with
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
this issue now for a few years and the
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
big issue has always been the radio
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
frequency of missions and we had people
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking about headaches and getting sick
 
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:53.219 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on and because I
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
guess of the Federal Regulations this
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
bill's explicitly comes out and says
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
other than the effects of radio
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
frequency emissions so is it kind of
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
like saying we know that's the big issue
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
but since we can't deal with it we're
 
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
going to try to create blocks another
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
it would be so much better if we had
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
been able to pass the Bill last session
 
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
that would have put a 500 meter 1 640
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
foot setback we wouldn't be having this
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
bill today but because the committee
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
didn't have a comfort level yet with the
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
facts around radio frequency radiation
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
emissions it was suggested that perhaps
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
we start with where we are in New
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
see what got put in there to strip local
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
control and reverse that and that's what
 
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
HB 298 does thank you
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'd remind members that we have five
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
more people who want to testify
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative muns you have another
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to thank you Miss Doucette
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
for being here and testifying on this
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd like to call next on Deb
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
Hodgman who lives in Stratham New
 
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is representing herself
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
Miss Hodgman Hodgdon
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
good morning welcome and thank you for
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
caring nice to see you Tony my name is
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
Deb Hodgson and I'm a long time res
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
resident of stratum I personally am
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
aware of the importance of understanding
 
02:00:19.729 --> 02:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
the potential dangers from our current
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
technology I was fortunate in 2018 when
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
my State Rep Patrick abrami and state
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
senator Dr Tom Sherman both listened to
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
me and co-sponsored New Hampshire 522 in
 
02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.850 align:start position:0%
me and co-sponsored New Hampshire 522 in
2019.

02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
this bill was bipartisan establishing a
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
commission to study the potential
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
effects of Wireless technology and New
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the very first in the
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
nation to do so in November 2020 the
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
commission submitted its report and the
 
02:00:46.209 --> 02:00:46.219 align:start position:0%
majority report had 15 recommendations
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
one of those relates to this exact Bill
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 293 in 2023 I mean 298 and
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
2023 after its investigation the
 
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
commission understood the difficult
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
situation towns and cities could find
 
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
themselves in while trying to navigate
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
following federal law this bill
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
is the state supporting its
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
municipalities in maintaining some
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
control in this area in which they are
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
since 2020 the Commission in its report
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
has been used worldwide as a guide to
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
others as we all grapple with how to
 
02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
best ensure the safety of the community
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
while providing the technology we all
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
depend upon it's fitting and reasonable
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should support its
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
own commission and continue to do what
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does best regardless of
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
political party and support local
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
control thank you
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
Miss Hodgdon
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for your
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and call next on
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
Christine Matthews of Stratford New
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing herself
 
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
welcome Ms Matthews
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
remember we are looking for testimony on
 
02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
not uh extraneous issues thank you
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.589 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
Committees

02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
Committees
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
most of my testimony is on the health
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
effects that have happened to me so
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
I will um
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
just keep that for
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
um for you guys to read
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
I support HB 298 because I believe
 
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
telecommunications should not have the
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
say and placement of salt Towers or
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
antennas in our towns I believe our town
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
should be educated well on the dangers
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
of radiation coming from the towers so
 
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
the towns can have safe zoning codes
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
that are safeguarded legally
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
in 2012 I first became injured by RF
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then I have all my health effects
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
and how
 
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
I actually became injured one and a half
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
years ago I moved from Pennsylvania to
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
um to a tan with no cell phone towers to
 
02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.669 align:start position:0%
um to a tan with no cell phone towers to
heal

02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.679 --> 02:03:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
zoning Zoning for four cell towers was
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
approved for my town now which currently
 
02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:14.300 align:start position:0%
now has no cell phone towers
 
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
I chose this town so I could heal
 
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
um if all four cell towers are
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
constructed according to the map of
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
zoning four zonings have already been
 
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
approved by the town of Stratford if all
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
four cell phone towers are constructed
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
the my home would receive overlapping RF
 
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
radiation from two of those cell phone
 
02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:36.109 align:start position:0%
radiation from two of those cell phone
towers

02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
towers
 
02:03:38.770 --> 02:03:38.780 align:start position:0%
I would also have to
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
quit working and just to
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
talk about here um I've been I was out
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
of work for three years because I was
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
near death
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:03:54.609 --> 02:03:54.619 align:start position:0%
I had to stop working to heal
 
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
since being here in New Hampshire a lot
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
of my test results have been able to
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
improve because I have kept my distance
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
from cell phone towers
 
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
and so seven months ago I was able to
 
02:04:11.649 --> 02:04:11.659 align:start position:0%
get back into working
 
02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
something that I didn't think would
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
happen so quickly but due to my tail not
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
having any cell phone towers I took just
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
a little job as waitressing two days a
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
week and
 
02:04:26.219 --> 02:04:26.930 align:start position:0%
week and
um

02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
one of those four cell phone towers that
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
has been approved for zoning would go up
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
right near the only restaurant that is
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the town and I would have to stop
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
working again and I was denied social
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
social security disability
 
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.209 align:start position:0%
social security disability
um

02:04:44.209 --> 02:04:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
I gave a testimony around this time last
 
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
year for HB 1644 and I talked about how
 
02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
I was around a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
in medical debt because insurance would
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
not cover
 
02:04:58.619 --> 02:04:59.390 align:start position:0%
not cover
um

02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
any of my bills I believe education is
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
key if I knew about the dangers of cell
 
02:05:08.089 --> 02:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
phone towers in 2012 then I would have
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
never taken the job I am a research
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%
scientist of almost 20 years I'm a
 
02:05:14.219 --> 02:05:15.250 align:start position:0%
scientist of almost 20 years I'm a
histologist

02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:15.260 align:start position:0%
histologist
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
certified in that where I test human
 
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
tissue for cancer and disease
 
02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
tissue for cancer and disease
um

02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:25.129 --> 02:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
so when I finally found doctors that
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
were able to help me which took many
 
02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:29.209 align:start position:0%
were able to help me which took many
years

02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
I was given some of the the worst news
 
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
about what has happened to my body but
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
being um in the field of science
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
um I understood a lot of it which
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of maybe was not so good because I
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
knew exactly what was happening to my
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
body and I knew that I was at very high
 
02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:55.089 align:start position:0%
body and I knew that I was at very high
risk

02:05:55.089 --> 02:05:55.099 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
for developing
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
cancer as well as diseases well we
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
sympathize with your your struggles
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
but we need to get back to the subject
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the pill and while your personal
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
history would be enjoyable for some
 
02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
people to to discuss with you maybe we
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
could do that offline okay okay I do ask
 
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
for support
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
um from the House of Representatives
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
especially of Stratford
 
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
to um please help me
 
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
to um please help me
um

02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
with uh stopping the construction of
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
four cell phone towers in my town
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you very much for
 
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.129 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you very much for
testifying

02:06:37.129 --> 02:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions I'll move on to the
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
next person on our list who is
 
02:06:45.129 --> 02:06:45.139 align:start position:0%
Jeremy crumdel
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Mr Vice chair uh
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Fabrizio uh shared most of my
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
testimony and I know you guys are uh
 
02:06:59.810 --> 02:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
short on time so I'm just going to share
 
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
a few key points but that's okay with
 
02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
um yes my name is Jeremy Crandall I'm
 
02:07:06.649 --> 02:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
here to testify on behalf of ctia the
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
wireless industry trade Association and
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 298. CTI and
 
02:07:14.209 --> 02:07:14.219 align:start position:0%
its members are strongly committed to
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
improving connectivity in this state
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
considering that on average residents
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
have nearly seven wireless devices in
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
their home
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
um responding to this exploding growth
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
ultimately very much is dependent on
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory certainty our members plot
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
out their budgets 18 to 24 months in
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
advance I mean I do just want to share
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
one stat related to how this helps
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
deliver both reliability and economic
 
02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:39.179 align:start position:0%
growth for the state in New Hampshire
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry contributes over
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
one billion dollars to the state's
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
annual GDP and employs over 12 000
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
residents and so unfortunately there are
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
multiple elements of House Bill 298 that
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
would create this regulatory confusion
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
and those are the two two or three key
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
points that I'm going to share that Echo
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
a little bit what Mr Fabrizio said I
 
02:07:59.810 --> 02:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
want to talk first of all about first of
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
all about the aspie appco standards this
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
has taken specific sorry let me start
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
with the that standard is not a health
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
and safety code instead it provides
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines as he shared related to
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
Public Safety networks to be able to
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
withstand the most extreme types of
 
02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
weather events earthquakes tornadoes
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
severe storms but I want to quote two
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
items from their report that I'd be
 
02:08:25.729 --> 02:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
happy to share with the committee quote
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
it is intended to assist Public Safety
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
Communications Network Builders with the
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
guidelines necessary to build hardened
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
Public Safety grade networks and that is
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
vastly different than a commercial uh
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
wireless network and here's one other
 
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
piece of this because I know that there
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
was a question related to cost also from
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
the report quote the high cost
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
associated with meeting these
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
requirements may not be feasible at all
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
sites and again this is talking about
 
02:08:52.729 --> 02:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
Public Safety grade Communications
 
02:08:54.589 --> 02:08:54.599 align:start position:0%
networks rather than commercial wireless
 
02:08:54.599 --> 02:08:56.330 align:start position:0%
networks rather than commercial wireless
networks

02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
networks
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
I do also want to touch on because
 
02:08:59.089 --> 02:08:59.099 align:start position:0%
there's been an important conversation
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
about the environmental impacts as well
 
02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
as historical and cultural sites if you
 
02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
are deploying infrastructure in any
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
state in any locality our our members
 
02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
must first comply with a bevy of Federal
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
Communications Commission FCC
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations there must be
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
pre-construction review by qualified
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
experts as it relates to compliance with
 
02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
the National Environmental Protection
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
act NEPA as Mr Fabrizio shared the
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
National Historic preservation act The
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act as well there
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
even if the the site is over 200 feet
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
tall there are also fafaa considerations
 
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
as well and the last piece that I'll
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
share is this I you know there's been a
 
02:09:44.689 --> 02:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
really important conversation about the
 
02:09:46.970 --> 02:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
role important role of local governments
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is from an FCC 2020 order says
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
localities could adopt quote generally
 
02:09:55.070 --> 02:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
applicable building structural
 
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
electrical and and safety codes and
 
02:09:59.810 --> 02:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
other laws codifying objective standards
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
reasonably related to health and safety
 
02:10:03.410 --> 02:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to share that because
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
that role is very important and nothing
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know from our standpoint of opposing
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not about taking the
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
tools away from what localities and the
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
state and the federal government already
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
do as it relates to regulating a
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
wireless infrastructure so I will pause
 
02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
there I'm happy to take any questions
 
02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
but we do oppose House Bill 298 for
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
these reasons
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your testimony
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for mispronouncing your
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
name that's okay make out your
 
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
handwriting there
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
so sorry about that so I serve on a
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
planning board in my town
 
02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
and your written testimony talks about
 
02:10:41.699 --> 02:10:43.370 align:start position:0%
and your written testimony talks about
how

02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
this bill requires local zoning
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
authorities to conduct environmental
 
02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.609 align:start position:0%
authorities to conduct environmental
reviews

02:10:49.609 --> 02:10:49.619 align:start position:0%
reviews
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
with a a process that is vague and
 
02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
boundless can you
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
elaborate on what you mean by that yes
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to Sir so if you look at
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
the bill and I've got it in here I
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's been some dialogue about how you
 
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
define quote invite I'm looking at line
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
19 environmental impact how would that
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
be defined how does this interplay with
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
already exist the already existing roles
 
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
of various state agencies here in New
 
02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does that uh interplay
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
with what the federal government already
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
does would just Echo what is already
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
well along the lines of the question
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
that you've already heard that we do
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
believe the way that that that section
 
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
A2 is written it is very vague and
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
boundless in terms of how those
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
standards would be applied in at the at
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
the locality level
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
so you Echo the question that
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative munz asked earlier about
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the vagueness of the environmental yes
 
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
sir Alexander would share that so my
 
02:11:52.129 --> 02:11:52.139 align:start position:0%
follow-up question would be
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
that your written testimony also states
 
02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:56.750 align:start position:0%
that your written testimony also states
that

02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
violate existing federal law
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
specifically the eligible facilities
 
02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
specifically the eligible facilities
requests

02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
requests
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
under section 6409a of the spectrum Act
 
02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:13.619 align:start position:0%
of 2012. I believe res Senator ricciardi
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
testified that that has been tested in
 
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
court and found not to be the case can
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
you elaborate on why you believe this
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of federal law so
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I did hear Senator rashardi
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh say that I will have to get back to
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
you speaking to that specific case I'm
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
not I'm not entirely sure which case she
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
was referring to but I'd be happy to
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
follow up a follow-up with the committee
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
but I will point back to in my testimony
 
02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
that quote about
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
um hold on I want to make sure I get it
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
right about what localities can adopt
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
related to generally applicable building
 
02:12:50.649 --> 02:12:50.659 align:start position:0%
standards and and
 
02:12:53.209 --> 02:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with that is that the
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
APCO ANSI hardening requirements are
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
incongruent with that FCC order and so
 
02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
we do ultimately uh have the perspective
 
02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
that including that standard in this
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
would run afoul of federal law because
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
of that order
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
okay but I'd be happy to get back to you
 
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
on the on the court case sir great thank
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
you representative munz has a question
 
02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
um I I I think I heard something and I
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I heard it
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
correctly that the FCC is part of the of
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
the process you have to go through with
 
02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
the FCC that they have some pretty
 
02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
significant environmental tests or rules
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
that you have to follow uh already
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
um is that that I hear that correctly
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
that is exactly right sir and I will
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
just say last night I I pulled those
 
02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
those standards up again I'd be happy to
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
send them to you it lays out a quite
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
extensive set of specifically
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
environmental standards related to NEPA
 
02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:53.099 align:start position:0%
the National Environmental Protection
 
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
act related to I know there's a question
 
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
about historical preservation as well
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
um there was a piece in there about that
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
our members have to consult qualified
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
experts in advance to ensure compliance
 
02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
with those and then the FCC has its own
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
well what I'm describing or what is
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
built into those FCC specifically
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations but yes
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
there's a significant set of them
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
so is there anything in the regulations
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
now that
 
02:14:20.159 --> 02:14:22.609 align:start position:0%
now that
um requires

02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
um requires
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
a carrier submit those findings to a
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
local Authority for their review
 
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
so and and and just because I only get
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
02:14:37.129 --> 02:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and if not is that something that you
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
know that maybe could be something that
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
we add to the bill that makes it a
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more amenable to you so I
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
will so I would have to speak with our
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
members about the second part of your
 
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
question what I want to do is speak to
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first part of your question in terms
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
of the actual exchange of paperwork you
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
know when when the FCC does that review
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
and how our members share that
 
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
information with the locality I cannot
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
speak to but I will happily look into
 
02:15:05.689 --> 02:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
what I can share is that there are a
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
range of items that local governments
 
02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
right now regardless of the passage of
 
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
this bill a range of items that local
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
governments um in terms of their ability
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
to weigh in as you ask Mr Vice chair on
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
the placement the the code of the code
 
02:15:23.689 --> 02:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
of abeyance obeyance of various building
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
codes and structural codes that already
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
exist in state law all of those
 
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
Provisions already exist in terms of the
 
02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
actual transference of the paperwork I
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
would have to get back to you on that
 
02:15:34.129 --> 02:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
part but I do very much want to
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
emphasize that localities have that
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
power right now and there's nothing that
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill nothing if this bill were not
 
02:15:43.129 --> 02:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
to pass nothing would change about that
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
that Dynamic but I'd happily give back
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
to you about that actual exchange of
 
02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
information sir representative
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank you Mr
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
question as you're probably aware we've
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
been debating this issue here now for a
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
bunch of years we've heard a lot of
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
different people come in and testify to
 
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
health problems and different issues
 
02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned about with this
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
given that and given that I think the
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill probably is going to be fixed up a
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
little bit in some areas we've talked
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
about would you be willing to work with
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
other people to come up with something
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's maybe a compromised piece of
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or is this looks like you
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't even consider this
 
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative in its current it the
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill as as drafted we have significant
 
02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
concerns with it um really just to
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
emphasize again that regulatory
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
certainty that we are of the belief that
 
02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
the the mission of what this bill is you
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
know and I won't speak for the sponsor
 
02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
that obviously is their message to
 
02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:39.410 align:start position:0%
that obviously is their message to
convey

02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
convey
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
um all of those protections already
 
02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
um all of those protections already
exist

02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
um in terms of structural integrity and
 
02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:45.290 align:start position:0%
um in terms of structural integrity and
otherwise

02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:47.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you've talked about regulations for
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
environmental standards that already
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
exist our health impacts considered and
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
if they are are there standards on
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
health impacts thank you uh
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas do you mean as it
 
02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
pertains to environmental standards or
 
02:17:08.929 --> 02:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
separately where Health standards
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
separately okay
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
um so what I can speak to is and and I
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to I mean you
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
could go to it right now but there's a
 
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
website that we have
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
wirelesshealthfacts.org that speaks to
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
both the scientific consensus related to
 
02:17:30.169 --> 02:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
5G and and health impacts but also
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
speaks to the role that our regulator
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission
 
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:35.330 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission
plays

02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
plays
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
um in terms of deployment of Wireless
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
facilities every piece of infrastructure
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know from a from a cell tower to a
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
cell phone ultimately has to be approved
 
02:17:46.610 --> 02:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
by our federal regulator the Federal
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
Communications Commission in a Range if
 
02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of a range of
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative cloje has a question uh
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
02:17:59.519 --> 02:18:00.770 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:02.110 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
going back to representative
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
Harrington's about
 
02:18:11.089 --> 02:18:11.099 align:start position:0%
I have issues also the AP the Apple
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't in there if the
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
environment pack wasn't in there as a
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
um if someone gave me
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
an application
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
from another agency Federal I would like
 
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
to have to ask an engineering report on
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
it because I don't think they would be
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
referenced I have never seen that and
 
02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I would like to ask you
 
02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.139 align:start position:0%
that type of rewrite or working with
 
02:18:48.530 --> 02:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
others if you could get back
 
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
to we represent and ask them those catch
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
things but the rest of the addition to
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
um without those two I would would like
 
02:19:05.209 --> 02:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
a feedback on that yeah excuse me sorry
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
I could ask the chair if he could ask
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
you for feedback on that for the
 
02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
you for feedback on that for the
commission

02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.169 --> 02:19:14.179 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry I was looking up
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
wirelesshealthimpacts.org and I didn't
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
hear what your question is
 
02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
representative closure do you need
 
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:22.380 align:start position:0%

individual
 
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
who is Deborah Chandler of South Hadley
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I'd remind Miss
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
Chandler that we're not here to hear
 
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
about the health impacts of Wireless
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
technology we're only interested in
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
hearing about
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
the specifics of this legislation
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I'm going to do my
 
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
best to
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
not upset the committee and to not
 
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
provide extraneous information but I had
 
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
pre-written this and yes it pertains to
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
in part to my health so feel free to cut
 
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
off my mic at any point
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um good morning esteemed committee
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
members my name is Deborah Chandler and
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
I currently live in South Hadley Mass
 
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
and God willing I will be living up here
 
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
in the great state of New Hampshire in
 
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
the coming months
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
I am what is called a canary in the coal
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
mine I am part of the early warning
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
system with regards to the health
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
injuries caused by Wireless
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
I joined the 20 of the population that
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
has developed significant EMF
 
02:20:57.530 --> 02:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
sensitivity and this number is growing
 
02:20:59.929 --> 02:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
I can no longer safely participate in a
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
society that is saturated with wireless
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
tech without getting sick and needing
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
recovery time
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm moving into the solutions part
 
02:21:09.889 --> 02:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
um I can no longer work in my profession
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm low income as a result I'm
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for low-income 55 plus housing
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
but I cannot live in those places as
 
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
they are all saturated with Wi-Fi
 
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there are no low-income
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
EMF safe housing communities anywhere in
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
New England
 
02:21:26.809 --> 02:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
there are a few and far away States and
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
in other countries
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
so I've come up with a solution I'm
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
creating an EMF safe tiny house
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
community in a rural in rural New
 
02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where there are no cell towers
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
within a few mile radius and as I embark
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
on this project I have at least 40
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
people showing strong interest
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
and shall I add need
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
we are all looking forward to finally
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
having a safe place to call home and as
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
a side note I'm working closely with the
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Tiny House Legislative
 
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.610 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Tiny House Legislative
folks

02:21:55.610 --> 02:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
but as we move forward on this project
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
our looming concern is still this how
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
can we be sure that our home sweet home
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
stays EMF safe
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
every day cell towers are going up in
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
locations where folks nearby were not
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
consulted not warned and great harm has
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
been done
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
so dear committee members in my heart of
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
hearts I hope and pray that you will
 
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
please make sure that H.R 298 is passed
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
into law
 
02:22:23.929 --> 02:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
and I am aware that this bill is not
 
02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
specifically about health and disability
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
per se but it is about giving power back
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
to the people to the state and the local
 
02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:33.530 align:start position:0%
to the people to the state and the local
governments

02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
governments
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
I have been very heartened that these
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've been very heartened these
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
last few years as New Hampshire has been
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
the first state in the nation to create
 
02:22:44.809 --> 02:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
a special commission to study Wireless
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
harms and now let's put all that
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
research and knowledge into action as we
 
02:22:51.469 --> 02:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
Empower and protect the people of the
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
great state of New Hampshire thank you
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
for focusing on solutions to this
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
important challenge
 
02:22:59.150 --> 02:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for expressing your support
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
for this legislation we appreciate it
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to call on the final person
 
02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
who wants to testify here today and
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's a person named Jalen I'm not sure
 
02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
if that's a first name or a last name
 
02:23:19.130 --> 02:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
could you state your full name for the
 
02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
record hi it's Galen Beach

Campton New Hampshire thank you thank
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
you very much for having this committee
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
and representative partial and and
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
visuality for
 
02:23:35.929 --> 02:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
um advancing this bill I would like to
 
02:23:38.809 --> 02:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
express my support for this bill
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily as it stands but
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
simply for the reason that um I don't
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
see any other Avenue at the moment for
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um trying to address what I find to be
 
02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
or what is a kind of a difficult
 
02:23:53.939 --> 02:23:55.550 align:start position:0%
or what is a kind of a difficult
situation

02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.330 align:start position:0%
situation
um

02:23:56.330 --> 02:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:59.650 --> 02:23:59.660 align:start position:0%
just to I'm a licensed certified
 
02:24:02.349 --> 02:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
reflexologist a healthcare practitioner
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
apart from that
 
02:24:07.849 --> 02:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to let you know that
 
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh several weeks ago I was in Concord on
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
Main Street and I went shopping and it's
 
02:24:17.929 --> 02:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
it was fine but I started to feel very
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
unwell I noticed that people in the
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
store were very you know kind of
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
agitated and things I took my
 
02:24:26.929 --> 02:24:26.939 align:start position:0%
acoustimeter which is a a radio
 
02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
frequency measuring device it's
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
calibrated it's you know it works I um
 
02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
turned it on in my car outside and it
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
registered uh extreme levels of you know
 
02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
that's the indication is get out of
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
there as quickly as possible it's
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
flashing red the static is shrieking
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is like North Main Street and
 
02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um it's right down the street from the
 
02:24:58.610 --> 02:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
fire station and as I driven in I
 
02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
noticed that there was this new short
 
02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:01.250 align:start position:0%
noticed that there was this new short
fat

02:25:01.250 --> 02:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
fat
 
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
cell tower I had never noticed it before
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's full of 5G you know additions and
 
02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.030 align:start position:0%
it's full of 5G you know additions and
things

02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
um it's right over the fire station I
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
went in and I talked to these guys and I
 
02:25:14.809 --> 02:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
said uh is this new because
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm having a heart attack right now
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
and uh you guys are working in this
 
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.510 align:start position:0%
and uh you guys are working in this
extreme

02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
frequencies 5G the problem or the issue
 
02:25:29.410 --> 02:25:29.420 align:start position:0%
I think with 5G is not
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
5G which is a marketing term but
 
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
excessive radio frequencies and
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
excessive microwave frequencies
 
02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
emanating from our devices and our cell
 
02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
phones and the arguments so far have
 
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
been something like well
 
02:25:48.889 --> 02:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
mwmur radio station puts out you know
 
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand act at that every day
 
02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
all day so what's the problem with just
 
02:25:58.969 --> 02:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
adding more you know 5G is going to incr
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
has already increased four and five G's
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
has already increased the extreme levels
 
02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
of of radio frequencies and microwaves
 
02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
in our environment in this room when I
 
02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
come in here I feel really crappy after
 
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
a few minutes but I come because I think
 
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's urgent anyways um when you talk
 
02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
about environmental harm we're talking
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
about potentially this is
 
02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:24.969 align:start position:0%
about potentially this is
um

02:26:24.969 --> 02:26:24.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotal to a degree but ever since
 
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
like 2018 there was a substantial
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
increase I believe in the output from
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
existing cell towers
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
um operated probably by Verizon at that
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
same particular time and especially at
 
02:26:45.050 --> 02:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
the beginning in 2019 of the pandemic
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
there was a very solid increase in the
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh cyanobacteria blooms and algal blooms
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
in most of the fresh water bodies in
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
including some of the lakes in The Lakes
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
region of New Hampshire and that trend
 
02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
has continued to increase so there's
 
02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
some environmental problems potentially
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:27:12.410 --> 02:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
this beach I'll start to interrupt sorry
 
02:27:15.050 --> 02:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony but can you
 
02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
apply it to this particular bill please
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes the ctia ETC talks about improving
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
connectivity I'm wondering how much is
 
02:27:28.969 --> 02:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
um necessary and what is actually
 
02:27:31.969 --> 02:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
required for connectivity I mean if I'm
 
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
in Concord right now and I'm trying to
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know get on on Wi-Fi or make a phone
 
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
call that would be easy to do
 
02:27:43.250 --> 02:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
um but uh I don't want to be microwaved
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
and made ill because I want to go
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
shopping or come to Concord I'm just
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's absolutely no
 
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
regulation and no concern or
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
consideration about regulating what are
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
harmful biological uh problems so the
 
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
um at least localities they may have the
 
02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
power to do stuff but they don't know
 
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
know anything about 4 and 5G and the
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
effects of it they have not been
 
02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
educated they've not been fully
 
02:28:15.899 --> 02:28:18.349 align:start position:0%
educated they've not been fully
explained

02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
explained
 
02:28:18.359 --> 02:28:19.809 align:start position:0%
explained
so

02:28:19.809 --> 02:28:19.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
this bill at least May provide some
 
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this uh issue this
 
02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
question this to find Solutions and to
 
02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
be Advanced and to be considered
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
um okay well we thank you for expressing
 
02:28:40.849 --> 02:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
your support to create a non-wifi Zone
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's there's lots of concern about
 
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
people having Wi-Fi connectivity what if
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
you cannot be within those frequencies
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some kind of effort
 
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
made to provide areas that do not have
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi and if this bill or any other one
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
has the potential for enabling or to to
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
address that in any further way than I
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
support the bill sorry thank you for
 
02:29:12.170 --> 02:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
your patience
 
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for expressing your support
 
02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
for this legislation
 
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the final pink card that I
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
have on this legislation is there
 
02:29:25.969 --> 02:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has not spoken who
 
02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
would like to speak very briefly
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing on
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
and I will open a public hearing on
 
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 605 relative to solar
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
generation under the renewable portfolio
 
02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:49.130 align:start position:0%
generation under the renewable portfolio
standard

02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
however we are going to take a break for
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
lunch before we get into that bill
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
and we will resume our public hearing on
 
02:29:59.929 --> 02:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 605
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
after the lunch break and after an
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
executive session that occurs at one
 
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
o'clock so we anticipate uh hearing this
 
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
bill probably sometime around two
 
02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:12.770 align:start position:0%
bill probably sometime around two
o'clock

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
so this committee is in on official
 
02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
lunch break from now until one o'clock
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you all for being here this
 
02:30:20.460 --> 04:04:51.110 align:start position:0%
thank you all for being here this
morning

04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%

everyone

04:04:53.450 --> 04:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:04:55.969 --> 04:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
it's now time to resume
 
04:04:58.910 --> 04:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
stne activity for the day and our
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
schedule calls for exec sessions at one
 
04:05:03.710 --> 04:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
o'clock this afternoon
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.170 --> 04:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
but before we begin representative Doug
 
04:05:14.090 --> 04:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
Thomas has an announcement he would like
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
to make to the full Committee just

04:05:51.490 --> 04:05:51.500 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.450 --> 04:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
give that information to the clerk you
 
04:06:00.769 --> 04:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
don't have to give it to us here on the
 
04:06:00.779 --> 04:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
don't have to give it to us here on the
committee

04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
all right are we ready
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open an exact session on
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 161 relative relative to
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
customer generators of electricity as
 
04:06:19.490 --> 04:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recess that exact
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
session why because at the public
 
04:06:27.889 --> 04:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
hearing last week
 
04:06:30.530 --> 04:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
Jim Monahan suggested that he wanted to
 
04:06:33.050 --> 04:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
work with representative Harrington on
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment to get clarity as to
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
exactly how that the process of
 
04:06:43.010 --> 04:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
group hosts under net metering
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
and customer generators in group net
 
04:06:48.290 --> 04:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
metering would work
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we're going to give them a week's
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
time to come up with an amendment to
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
clarify that situation and we will
 
04:06:55.199 --> 04:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
clarify that situation and we will
resume

04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
resume
 
04:06:59.689 --> 04:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
this executive session
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
at a date to be noticed in the calendar
 
04:07:11.330 --> 04:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
so since that
 
04:07:15.710 --> 04:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
exact session is recessed I don't need
 
04:07:19.130 --> 04:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
to close it because it hasn't reached
 
04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.110 --> 04:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
did you have a question representative
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
Thomas obviously ah okay
 
04:07:27.720 --> 04:07:29.389 align:start position:0%
Thomas obviously ah okay
so

04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
I will next open an executive session on
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 81 which establishes a study
 
04:07:36.410 --> 04:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee to examine all ancillary
 
04:07:40.250 --> 04:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
charges for propane gas sales
 
04:07:41.929 --> 04:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
and ditto with the previous Bill we're
 
04:07:43.969 --> 04:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
going to recess this exact session
 
04:07:45.969 --> 04:07:45.979 align:start position:0%
because next Wednesday
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas that
 
04:07:51.610 --> 04:07:51.620 align:start position:0%
is has scheduled a
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
04:07:57.050 --> 04:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
to decide exactly how to handle this
 
04:07:57.060 --> 04:07:57.950 align:start position:0%
to decide exactly how to handle this
bill

04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
will we go forward with creating a study
 
04:08:03.769 --> 04:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
committee or might there be some
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
worthy of of consideration for that
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%

head

04:09:22.969 --> 04:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.130 --> 04:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has his notes open

and he'll read that he'll read the
 
04:09:30.650 --> 04:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
members I believe it's a partial Sumner
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
summer uh Bernardi plouge and myself it
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
was what was announced
 
04:09:42.110 --> 04:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
anyone is welcome to attend a
 
04:09:46.010 --> 04:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
04:09:48.650 --> 04:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
I would be there myself except for the
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
fact that it's scheduled at the very
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
same time as a doctor appointment I have
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
all right so that takes care of HB 81
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
that could be a fairly exciting
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting so I'd urge you to
 
04:10:04.920 --> 04:10:07.729 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting so I'd urge you to
attend

04:10:07.729 --> 04:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.490 --> 04:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
so now I'm going to open a executive
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
session on the HB 381 relative to the
 
04:10:16.250 --> 04:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge and I recognize
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for a motion a
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
move to retain the bill
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
I recognize Doug Thomas second
 
04:10:26.210 --> 04:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 381.
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you want to
 
04:10:33.000 --> 04:10:33.769 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you want to
um

04:10:33.769 --> 04:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:36.290 --> 04:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
comment on your just briefly there's
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
some changes that probably could be made
 
04:10:39.530 --> 04:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
to improve the bill and I'd like to have
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
a chance to do that
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on retaining House
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 381 representative Corman thank you
 
04:10:50.330 --> 04:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh representative Harrington
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious can you characterize
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
briefly the nature of the changes you
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
have in mind
 
04:10:58.010 --> 04:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
well there'd be a few but one of the
 
04:10:59.330 --> 04:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
first ones that jumped out because I
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
have to do a little research on this was
 
04:11:03.410 --> 04:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
it said that the prior approval could be
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the passage of the legislature by the
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
general court or authorization by the
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and I think it was Mr
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
crease brought that up that may not be
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
legal I don't I just don't know so
 
04:11:16.370 --> 04:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
without researching further I couldn't
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
say but I obviously don't want to have
 
04:11:24.250 --> 04:11:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:11:29.330 --> 04:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
chair um just an a clarification
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
question in the amendment would it
 
04:11:33.650 --> 04:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
change any of the levels from uh you're
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
still talking about capping it at 2020
 
04:11:35.880 --> 04:11:39.410 align:start position:0%
still talking about capping it at 2020
levels

04:11:39.410 --> 04:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh that's for you representative I would
 
04:11:43.689 --> 04:11:43.699 align:start position:0%
basically leave it the same unless
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's some reason to change it okay
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm open to looking at it let
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%

House Bill 381 is retained by the
 
04:13:08.939 --> 04:13:11.090 align:start position:0%
House Bill 381 is retained by the
committee

committee
 
04:13:13.969 --> 04:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
once that notice is made to the clerk we
 
04:13:15.969 --> 04:13:15.979 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything with that bill until
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.370 --> 04:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll close the exact
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 381
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to open an exact
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
and I will make the motion of ought to
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 385 and offer to the
 
04:13:45.130 --> 04:13:45.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
20230360h and copies of that Amendment
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
will be forthcoming to you and I
 
04:13:52.319 --> 04:13:53.809 align:start position:0%
will be forthcoming to you and I
recognize

04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
I second the motion so it's been moved
 
04:14:04.250 --> 04:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we judge HP 385 as
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
but first we have to take up the
 
04:14:10.610 --> 04:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
amendment itself and that's Amendment
 
04:14:14.450 --> 04:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
zero two zero two three zero three six
 
04:14:15.769 --> 04:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
zero h
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
which each of you should be receiving
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh momentarily
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does I'll explain it
 
04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
as the paperwork is being passed around
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it adds
 
04:14:33.469 --> 04:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
three things to the original bill as
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
outlined during his testimony by The
 
04:14:38.090 --> 04:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
Honorable Clifton below
 
04:14:40.969 --> 04:14:40.979 align:start position:0%
this past
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
I guess that was yesterday wasn't it
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
when we heard this bill
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
so the first change is on page one line
 
04:14:49.199 --> 04:14:50.990 align:start position:0%
so the first change is on page one line
30.

04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
30.
 
04:14:53.210 --> 04:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
the addition of the sentence for
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
non-residential rate payers the
 
04:14:57.650 --> 04:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
department shall dock it and make plug
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
public any received complaint
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's the first change to the bill
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
the second change is on page two
 
04:15:09.410 --> 04:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
starting at line one a new section is
 
04:15:09.420 --> 04:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
starting at line one a new section is
added

04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
added
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
which states that the procedure for
 
04:15:18.130 --> 04:15:18.140 align:start position:0%
complaints is outlined in this section
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
shall apply to complaints filed with the
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on or after the
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act so any
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
complaint filed prior to the effective
 
04:15:31.929 --> 04:15:31.939 align:start position:0%
date of this act would conform to
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
procedures that were in effect at that
 
04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:36.889 align:start position:0%
procedures that were in effect at that
time

04:15:36.889 --> 04:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:15:38.809 --> 04:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
and then the Third change to this bill
 
04:15:42.110 --> 04:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
is the effective date on line four page
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
two this date this out act shall take
 
04:15:47.689 --> 04:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
effect upon its passage rather than 60
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
days after its passage as it was
 
04:15:52.849 --> 04:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
originally written and that was also a
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation of
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
Mr below who felt that
 
04:15:58.140 --> 04:16:00.110 align:start position:0%
Mr below who felt that
if

04:16:00.110 --> 04:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
the ACT took effect took effect upon its
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
passage and might ameliorate the problem
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
described in section c of Section 3
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
rather even though he felt it was
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to add Section 3 as well
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
so that is the amendment and uh
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open the floor to a
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
discussion of the amendment before we
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
vote on it representative Reynolds has a
 
04:16:23.580 --> 04:16:25.070 align:start position:0%
vote on it representative Reynolds has a
question

04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:29.210 --> 04:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes a question I
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment the second item in the
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
amendment I assume that the procedure
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
for complaints pursuant
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
as amended by this act
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
is that essentially the same uh
 
04:16:45.769 --> 04:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
procedure for complaints that used to be
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
in the puc's purview is now the one that
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
that is correct so they
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
until this act
 
04:16:55.610 --> 04:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
becomes effective
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
the procedure that's in place at the
 
04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
04:17:02.090 --> 04:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate these complaints will be
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
the procedure followed
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:17:09.010 --> 04:17:09.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion or questions
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
comment thank you yes we heard from the
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
doe that that passage of this bill would
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
require the hiring of two separate
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
people does this amendment
 
04:17:20.399 --> 04:17:21.050 align:start position:0%
people does this amendment
um

04:17:21.050 --> 04:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
affect that decision at all
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not address that
 
04:17:29.090 --> 04:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
question and it may be relevant
 
04:17:32.050 --> 04:17:32.060 align:start position:0%
but we had
 
04:17:34.130 --> 04:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
contradictory testimony during the
 
04:17:38.330 --> 04:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh some folks suggested
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
that staff would be needy needed
 
04:17:42.670 --> 04:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
additional staff would be needed others
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
testified that it wouldn't so I suggest
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
we go forward with this bill and let the
 
04:17:51.889 --> 04:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
Senate work that out if it becomes it
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me thank you
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
further comment representative munz
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I'm still
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
struggling with the fact that we are
 
04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
um inserting a second agency into the
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
process of reviewing complaints
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I I had mentioned during the
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
um during the hearing that you know the
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
way I read the bill and it appears that
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
the amendment hasn't changed that is
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
that you know a complaint uh and uh if
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with a decision by the
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
puc the complaint goes to the doe so now
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
the now the doe first has to understand
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
what the basis for the for the for the
 
04:18:35.450 --> 04:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
um decision was so they've got to go
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
over to the puc and get all the files so
 
04:18:39.410 --> 04:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
that they understand what they did
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:18:43.729 --> 04:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
um it gets it gets referred
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the puc if there's an issue and if
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm somebody that's filing a
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
um a complaint
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to have any Assurance
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
at all that I'm going to get a hearing
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
if the same agency that I'm complaining
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
about is the one that makes the ultimate
 
04:19:04.319 --> 04:19:05.269 align:start position:0%
about is the one that makes the ultimate
decision

04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
and to me as I suggested in the hearing
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
to me the more fair approach is let the
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
puc do all of the due diligence on the
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
complaint make an initial decision and
 
04:19:19.790 --> 04:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
then if they're still not resolution or
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's still a concern appeal that
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
decision to a a third party that you
 
04:19:29.090 --> 04:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
know doesn't have a vested interest
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment I would like
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
to comment on your comment
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that the addition of
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
section two a section three rather on
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
page two starting at line one seeks to
 
04:19:41.760 --> 04:19:44.210 align:start position:0%
page two starting at line one seeks to
address

04:19:44.210 --> 04:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:44.220 --> 04:19:45.969 align:start position:0%
 
by

04:19:45.969 --> 04:19:45.979 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
codifying that any complaint made before
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
the passage of this legislation
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
is adjudicated under an existing POC
 
04:19:55.080 --> 04:19:57.410 align:start position:0%
is adjudicated under an existing POC
process

04:19:57.410 --> 04:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:20:00.769 --> 04:20:00.779 align:start position:0%
then there will never be a transfer of
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
files from the puc to the DOE
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
it'll continue to be a puc
 
04:20:11.570 --> 04:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
adjudication only new complaints filed
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
after the date of this pass of passage
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
of this legislation would be adjudicated
 
04:20:22.150 --> 04:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
under the dot process described in the
 
04:20:24.650 --> 04:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill
 
04:20:27.410 --> 04:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
so you you sort of misunderstood the
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
point I guess of the amendment well I
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
maybe I did and if I if so I apologize
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
but I mean it it
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly the body of
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
the language in section 2 talks about
 
04:20:42.889 --> 04:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
what the process is going to be going
 
04:20:45.769 --> 04:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
forward correct
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
correct and that process is that if
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
there's a complaint
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
then the doe will investigate it
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
and if the doe is able to resolve the
 
04:20:55.920 --> 04:20:56.990 align:start position:0%
and if the doe is able to resolve the
complaint

04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
they will do so
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
and if they can't resolve the complaint
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
if there's a disagreement between the
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
doe and the complainant over the Doe's
 
04:21:11.210 --> 04:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
resolution of the complaint then the
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
whole process can be taken to the puc
 
04:21:16.849 --> 04:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
for an adjudicative process which is a
 
04:21:16.859 --> 04:21:18.410 align:start position:0%
for an adjudicative process which is a
fact-based

04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
fact-based
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh examination of the question
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
okay I I don't I I don't think I
 
04:21:27.769 --> 04:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
misunderstood then because that's that's
 
04:21:30.769 --> 04:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
my concern that it's going from it's
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
going from the puc to the doe and then
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
back to the puc
 
04:21:37.610 --> 04:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
well maybe if we use an analogy it could
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
help you uh understand let's say someone
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
commits a crime
 
04:21:45.889 --> 04:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
the police investigate the crime and
 
04:21:47.210 --> 04:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
then when they're satisfied they've
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
compiled the the
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
the facts of the case they take it to
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
the district's attorney the district
 
04:21:54.960 --> 04:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
the district's attorney the district
attorney

04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
if he's satisfied that the facts of the
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
case warranted he takes it to the judge
 
04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
and maybe a judge and a jury and they
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
decide whether the facts in the case as
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
presented as investigated
 
04:22:09.479 --> 04:22:12.050 align:start position:0%
presented as investigated
are

04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
warrant a a conviction or an acquittal
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
the situation here would be similar
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
complaint gets filed it's kind of like a
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
crime and the doe is like the police
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
they investigate the crime and maybe
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can resolve it
 
04:22:32.150 --> 04:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
because it's not really a crime it's a
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
it's a complaint maybe they can resolve
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
it but if they can't then
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
they take it to the judge which is the
 
04:22:43.130 --> 04:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
puc but the judge is also the criminal
 
04:22:46.189 --> 04:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
in your in your analogy no because the
 
04:22:48.530 --> 04:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
judge is not the criminal
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
the the complaint is filed by a
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
municipality or a community aggregate
 
04:22:59.809 --> 04:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
aggregator or a utility those are the
 
04:22:59.819 --> 04:23:01.010 align:start position:0%
aggregator or a utility those are the
complainants

04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not the puc who files the
 
04:23:06.590 --> 04:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
complaint it's it's a it's a utility a
 
04:23:09.170 --> 04:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
municipality a community aggregator
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are alleging that
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
some kind of an offense has happened and
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
then the doe investigates and tries to
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
resolve it and if they can't then the
 
04:23:22.490 --> 04:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
POC becomes the ultimate arbitrator but
 
04:23:22.500 --> 04:23:24.410 align:start position:0%
POC becomes the ultimate arbitrator but
the

04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
but the the only reason the complainant
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
is filing a complaint is because they
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
believe that the puc
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
did something wrong a a a crime in your
 
04:23:41.590 --> 04:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
analogy so no no okay they believe that
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh the poc's rules have been violated by
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
another party
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the puc itself
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you had a
 
04:23:56.330 --> 04:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
comment yeah this is not this is sort of
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
like the bigger change we did when we
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
switched from the just the puc and
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
created the department of energy and
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just here this same idea of
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
process where whoever is has a complaint
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
or an issue we take it to the Department
 
04:24:10.610 --> 04:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
of energy they have the staff to perform
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
the investigation and if they can come
 
04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
to resolution with the parties they come
 
04:24:17.689 --> 04:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
to resolution there if one of the
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
parties doesn't feel as though they got
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
a fair shake or don't like what the
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
resolution was they can petition that to
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
go to the puc and as the chairman said
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a formal educative process
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
and then they would make a final ruling
 
04:24:31.490 --> 04:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
and the puc would be based on that on
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
whether they thought the rules were
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
violated or not so it doesn't start with
 
04:24:38.150 --> 04:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
the puc go to the doe then back to the
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
puc it goes directly to doe it's very
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
similar to the fact if if you're just a
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
utility customer and you have a problem
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
with since I'm looking at eversource and
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
um you would call the doe and you would
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
file a complaint and if you couldn't
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
work that issue out eventually it could
 
04:24:55.610 --> 04:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
be brought up to the commission and they
 
04:24:57.170 --> 04:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
would have an educative process and
 
04:24:59.809 --> 04:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
hearings and make a decision on that and
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
as the same with any decision out of the
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
puc there's only one body that you can
 
04:25:05.150 --> 04:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
appeal that to and that's the Supreme
 
04:25:05.160 --> 04:25:06.229 align:start position:0%
appeal that to and that's the Supreme
Court

04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:25:11.090 --> 04:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
but Mr chair go ahead representative um
 
04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
but all of this would have been would be
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
avoided if
 
04:25:17.929 --> 04:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
the staff that was doing this when it
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
was part of the puc was returned to the
 
04:25:20.279 --> 04:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
was part of the puc was returned to the
puc

04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
puc
 
04:25:23.570 --> 04:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
if I may yes but that's not the case
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're not there anymore that was that
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
was the whole purpose for the
 
04:25:28.610 --> 04:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
reorganization one of the purposes in
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
the creation of the Department of energy
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
and I just follow up on that by pointing
 
04:25:34.969 --> 04:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
out that if you listen to the testimony
 
04:25:38.210 --> 04:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
of The Honorable Cliff below he filed a
 
04:25:40.849 --> 04:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
complaint on a similar issue with the
 
04:25:43.250 --> 04:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
puc in 2017 and still hasn't gotten a
 
04:25:43.260 --> 04:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
puc in 2017 and still hasn't gotten a
resolution

04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:25:47.450 --> 04:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason for that is
 
04:25:47.460 --> 04:25:48.590 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason for that is
because

04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:25:51.170 --> 04:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
um when the puc and the doe were
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
separated the Staffing went from the POC
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
to the DOE
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
for doing compliance regulatory
 
04:25:59.279 --> 04:26:02.630 align:start position:0%
for doing compliance regulatory
investigations

04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.610 --> 04:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair um I just
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to remind people that um during
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard that there are on
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
average two to three complaints a year
 
04:26:15.050 --> 04:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
and there was some discussion about
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not this was a solution
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
further comments on this question
 
04:26:27.769 --> 04:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes I could share
 
04:26:29.580 --> 04:26:30.229 align:start position:0%
yes I could share
um

04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm knowing that the DU the doe is
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
already has a Workforce of 65 people and
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
hearing that it's going to be necessary
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
to hire additional Personnel to handle
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
this I know we're sensitive handling to
 
04:26:46.610 --> 04:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
hiring additional Personnel because of
 
04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
our recent Green Bank
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
um Bill we were concerned about having
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
hired another additional Personnel for
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
that my question would be could you
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
explain why that additional Personnel is
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
not already present in the doae if they
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.090 --> 04:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
there are Personnel in the DOA doe in
 
04:27:07.370 --> 04:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
the compliance division that do exactly
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
so the uh follow-up this if I can follow
 
04:27:13.920 --> 04:27:14.809 align:start position:0%
so the uh follow-up this if I can follow
up

04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so the uh speculation that we would
 
04:27:19.370 --> 04:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
need a higher additional Personnel it
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
could be very well unfounded it was yeah
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
this is what the doe testified
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes we heard testimony both ways uh
 
04:27:29.149 --> 04:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
somebody we heard testimony that said
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
they may need new staff and we heard
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that said it's unlikely that
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
they would need new staff okay thank you
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been following
 
04:27:38.809 --> 04:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
following the
 
04:27:42.170 --> 04:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh development of the new house budget
 
04:27:44.929 --> 04:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
will have heard that the department of
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
energy is already asking for some staff
 
04:27:50.809 --> 04:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
increases in the in the uh in its new
 
04:27:54.290 --> 04:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
budget so it's it's
 
04:27:57.170 --> 04:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
at least possible that adequate Staffing
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
will be there for
 
04:28:01.070 --> 04:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
the relatively small number of
 
04:28:01.080 --> 04:28:02.269 align:start position:0%
the relatively small number of
complaints

04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
that are likely to occur now the reason
 
04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
this bill exists one of the reasons this
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill exists is because
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation doesn't actually
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
exist yet in practice it's just a a
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
theory at this point or a a piece of
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and so it's not really known
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
how many complaints may eventually arise
 
04:28:27.490 --> 04:28:27.500 align:start position:0%
but it's not likely that
 
04:28:30.530 --> 04:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
any significant number of complaints
 
04:28:33.530 --> 04:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
will arise in the next year
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the commission felt it
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to have a process
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
in place to deal with that
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:47.330 --> 04:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of the adoption
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%

the public hearing on House Bill 605.
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
and then we took a lunch break
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that means that we can resume this
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing

business side of of clean energy
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
uh actually working for Unitil I worked
 
04:36:05.879 --> 04:36:06.470 align:start position:0%
uh actually working for Unitil I worked
for

04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
a year and a half 18 months for Unitil
 
04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
in fact directly for Cindy Carroll who
 
04:36:13.131 --> 04:36:13.141 align:start position:0%
you may remember presented to this
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee on behalf of Unitil a few
 
04:36:18.051 --> 04:36:18.061 align:start position:0%
weeks ago so anyway that background my
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
uh my bill
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill 605 is is very
 
04:36:21.959 --> 04:36:23.689 align:start position:0%
House Bill 605 is is very
straightforward

04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
it uh seeks to have new state of New
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Take the Long View on the
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
important task
 
04:36:34.010 --> 04:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
of this legislature in ensuring a
 
04:36:36.529 --> 04:36:36.539 align:start position:0%
low-cost and diverse portfolio
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
uh for default service the default
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
service rate payers of New Hampshire
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
by requiring
 
04:36:45.650 --> 04:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
our investor-owned utilities to procure
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
in their default Service Supply
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing amounts of
 
04:36:53.209 --> 04:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.449 --> 04:36:59.459 align:start position:0%
um referring to the one side of the
 
04:36:59.459 --> 04:37:00.709 align:start position:0%
um referring to the one side of the
handout

04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
that I just handed out the one well both
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
of them of course
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
came from
 
04:37:12.410 --> 04:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
the handout we got from ISO New England
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's no secret that among the states all
 
04:37:19.369 --> 04:37:19.379 align:start position:0%
the states in New in New England
 
04:37:21.529 --> 04:37:21.539 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is by far the least
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
ambitious with our renewable portfolio
 
04:37:24.779 --> 04:37:26.330 align:start position:0%
ambitious with our renewable portfolio
standard

04:37:26.330 --> 04:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
and in times past it could reasonably be
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
claimed that New Hampshire did this so
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
as to protect its rate payers from
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
bearing the costs of forcing utilities
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
to buy renewable energy
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
which was often more expensive
 
04:37:40.020 --> 04:37:41.810 align:start position:0%
which was often more expensive
well

04:37:41.810 --> 04:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
the rate shock that all utility
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
customers in New Hampshire indeed in New
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
England are actually the entire world
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
are experiencing now
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the wake of Russia's invasion of
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
Ukraine and other
 
04:38:00.890 --> 04:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
Global developments like inflation
 
04:38:03.170 --> 04:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
and the rapid jump in global fossil fuel
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
prices means that those days are indeed
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
if I could get all the members of this
 
04:38:12.769 --> 04:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
committee to really and truly grasp
 
04:38:16.849 --> 04:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
one thing it would be this
 
04:38:19.609 --> 04:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
all of us all New Hampshire residents
 
04:38:22.490 --> 04:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
and businesses are price takers
 
04:38:24.890 --> 04:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
of those fossil fuels
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
on the global market
 
04:38:30.529 --> 04:38:30.539 align:start position:0%
it is global supply and demand and world
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
events like Wars hurricanes terrorist
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
attacks ships getting stuck sideways in
 
04:38:36.840 --> 04:38:38.810 align:start position:0%
attacks ships getting stuck sideways in
canals

04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
canals
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
whatever that determine
 
04:38:46.010 --> 04:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
the price ups and downs of fossil fuels
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have no control
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has no fossil fuels we are
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
not Texas
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
Wyoming West Virginia or even
 
04:38:56.160 --> 04:38:57.830 align:start position:0%
Wyoming West Virginia or even
Pennsylvania

04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
which is another Northeast State that
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
does participate in Reggie
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
are dependence on natural gas and oil
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
for the vast majority of heating and
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
nearly 60 percent of electricity
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
generation at Peak demand times is an
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
enormous vulnerability
 
04:39:18.410 --> 04:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
and economic weakness for our state
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to utility rates
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
04:39:26.330 --> 04:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
go to the puc every six months
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
and they tell
 
04:39:30.529 --> 04:39:30.539 align:start position:0%
the puc and the public
 
04:39:32.689 --> 04:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
this is what happened to the price of
 
04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
so this is what our rates must be we
 
04:39:42.288 --> 04:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
must pass through the cost of that to
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and the puc really has no
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
chance no other choice than to say
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know okay you're right that's the
 
04:39:51.770 --> 04:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel on the global market
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
everybody knows it no amount of outrage
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
or Bluster or claims that we're going to
 
04:40:01.730 --> 04:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
give them rate relief
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the short term can change that fact
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
this dependence and vulnerability to the
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
global fossil fuel Market are
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
antithetical to New Hampshire's prized
 
04:40:15.650 --> 04:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
values of self-reliance Independence
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
taking care of our own the six billion
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
dollars over six billion dollars
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we spend on fossil fuels every year
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
think about that 500 million dollars
 
04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
every month spent in New Hampshire on
 
04:40:32.208 --> 04:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels that represents over two
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
percent of our state's GDP
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
we send out of state to power our
 
04:40:39.970 --> 04:40:39.980 align:start position:0%
economy that represents lost opportunity
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and export of New
 
04:40:45.050 --> 04:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wealth and resources if we
 
04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
care about price and we care about rates
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
and we all do
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
we all do
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
then we must use every tool we have to
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
achieve increased portfolio diversity
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
which enhances our strength and
 
04:40:59.040 --> 04:41:00.288 align:start position:0%
which enhances our strength and
resilience

04:41:00.288 --> 04:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
resilience
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the face of global fossil fuel
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
markets diversity reduces risk
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
it reduces demand especially at peak
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
times when spot prices on the regional
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
market are highest and thus it lowers
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
rates it
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
exerts downward pressure on rates
 
04:41:21.890 --> 04:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
it is policy Maker's responsibility our
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility our constituents expect
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
us to have foresight and the willingness
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
to understand the emerging energy
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
landscape the capabilities and
 
04:41:33.650 --> 04:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
advantages offered by new technology and
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
make policies that look over the horizon
 
04:41:42.770 --> 04:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
to where we need to be 5 10. 20 30 years
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
from now
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
and begin to turn the massive ship
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
that is our Energy System
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
renewable energy has the singular virtue
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
of having zero fuel costs
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
let me repeat that the fuel cost of
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
04:42:05.570 --> 04:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
is zero and will always be zero
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
many on this committee have expressed
 
04:42:09.650 --> 04:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
deep skepticism about renewable energy
 
04:42:12.050 --> 04:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
the value of renewable energy because
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's not always available that is only
 
04:42:16.970 --> 04:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
when the sun is shining or the wind is
 
04:42:16.980 --> 04:42:18.170 align:start position:0%
when the sun is shining or the wind is
blowing

04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
blowing
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
and of course that statement is correct
 
04:42:23.810 --> 04:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
though it's rapidly being rendered
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
incorrect by the emerging uh by the
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
emergence of energy storage Technologies
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
members of this committee shouldn't
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
concern themselves
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
with that that fact of intermittency in
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
Renewables because as we've heard in
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
testimony everyone
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
we our utilities and the regional grid
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
operator all understand that the fact of
 
04:42:56.330 --> 04:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
intermittency of Renewables it's
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
accounted for by assigning them a low
 
04:43:00.890 --> 04:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
capacity factor in the regional forward
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
capacity market so their value is
 
04:43:03.180 --> 04:43:05.690 align:start position:0%
capacity market so their value is
discounted

04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
discounted
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
but we've also heard repeated testimony
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
that the way the regional power Market
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
operates power is always dispatched
 
04:43:12.000 --> 04:43:13.490 align:start position:0%
operates power is always dispatched
economically

04:43:13.490 --> 04:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
economically
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is from the cheapest to the most
 
04:43:16.080 --> 04:43:17.930 align:start position:0%
that is from the cheapest to the most
expensive

04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:43:20.570 --> 04:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
renewable energy which has zero fuel
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
costs is very cheap when it's available
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
when it's available it should be used
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
and when it's used it reduces demand for
 
04:43:33.530 --> 04:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
electricity from power plants powered by
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
what is by far the largest source of
 
04:43:38.208 --> 04:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
non-renewable fuel currently has very
 
04:43:41.448 --> 04:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
high fuel costs which is natural gas and
 
04:43:43.368 --> 04:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
this would leave that natural gas
 
04:43:46.970 --> 04:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
available to be used another day another
 
04:43:49.010 --> 04:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
cloudy day
 
04:43:51.170 --> 04:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
or another cold night when solar is not
 
04:43:51.180 --> 04:43:52.430 align:start position:0%
or another cold night when solar is not
available

04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:43:52.440 --> 04:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
available
so

04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to refer you to the other
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
side of the handout
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
which again came from ISO New England
 
04:44:05.330 --> 04:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
the current and certainly historical
 
04:44:12.530 --> 04:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
impact of distributed solar
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
behind the meter solar as well as Energy
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency but we're focusing on
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
distributed solar here today
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
it was the regional grid operator the
 
04:44:24.180 --> 04:44:26.390 align:start position:0%
it was the regional grid operator the
non-profit

04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
Regional grid operator the one that's
 
04:44:32.530 --> 04:44:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
forecasting demand ensuring sufficient
 
04:44:36.480 --> 04:44:37.610 align:start position:0%
forecasting demand ensuring sufficient
Supply

04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
they told us that distributed solar
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
has had and is projected to continue to
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
have significant
 
04:44:51.530 --> 04:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
downward effect on
 
04:44:54.890 --> 04:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
Regional demand and that Regional that
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
reduction in growth in Regional demand
 
04:44:59.810 --> 04:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
will lower the cost of wholesale power
 
04:45:01.610 --> 04:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
which will flow through the Retail
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
Energy costs that the utilities present
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
in rate cases
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
and that appears you know on our on our
 
04:45:14.330 --> 04:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
a significant policy that New Hampshire
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
has had on its books for many years
 
04:45:24.650 --> 04:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
is an important Market signal
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
and we should use it to good effect
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
it's an important Market signal that
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
says to the private Developers
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
or private businesses even residential
 
04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
homeowners build more solar
 
04:45:40.970 --> 04:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
do more of this
 
04:45:42.890 --> 04:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
so we should do it so we should
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
strengthen the RPS and that's what my
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
build does
 
04:45:46.440 --> 04:45:47.868 align:start position:0%
build does
it

04:45:47.868 --> 04:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
takes the anemic
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
numbers the
 
04:45:54.890 --> 04:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
worst in the New England and probably
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
worst in the country uh
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
Market signal that the state sends for
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
for solar PV and it increases it
 
04:46:03.060 --> 04:46:05.628 align:start position:0%
for solar PV and it increases it
modestly

04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
modestly
 
04:46:09.410 --> 04:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
modestly over the next
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
25 years to 2050.
 
04:46:14.090 --> 04:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
and we should send that signal to the
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
market for the benefit of our
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
selves and our ratepayers and our great
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and with that
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for introducing this
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill representative Summers has a
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:46:33.650 --> 04:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh quick questions
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
looking over this and I just have a base
 
04:46:37.970 --> 04:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
question for you on
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
a great job of describing the supply of
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
Renewables and I know on our electric
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
bills we have two sections we have the
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
supply and we have the transmission well
 
04:46:50.810 --> 04:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is as the Val the
 
04:46:52.368 --> 04:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
availability of it and the transmission
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
the supply goes up
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but what I don't see and I don't
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand even the cost benefit when
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
you figure in and we know because of
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
testimony the puc stated the utilities
 
04:47:07.128 --> 04:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
rate make their profit off the capital
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
cause the cost capital on the
 
04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
transmission lines the cost of the
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
transmission to be able to provide wind
 
04:47:16.490 --> 04:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
and solar to everybody out here what the
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
cost difference and how much that would
 
04:47:25.570 --> 04:47:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure what you're asking me
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
there my question is would these would
 
04:47:32.810 --> 04:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
these with the is the renewable energy
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
rates as increase as high as you show
 
04:47:37.850 --> 04:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
here with an increase on the bill as you
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
show here will that be actually
 
04:47:41.340 --> 04:47:41.948 align:start position:0%
show here will that be actually
um

04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:44.090 --> 04:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to the amount of cost
 
04:47:46.010 --> 04:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
it would be to the payers when they have
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
to realize the utilize the transmission
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
cost as well
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
well I'll take a stab at that I think
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
the cost of what are what our investor
 
04:48:04.850 --> 04:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
owned utilities whatever Source Liberty
 
04:48:07.490 --> 04:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
um Unitil I'll do the co-op they they
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
now as we know run trans uh Distribution
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
Systems local Distribution Systems and
 
04:48:13.320 --> 04:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
Systems local Distribution Systems and
um

04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:14.160 --> 04:48:16.910 align:start position:0%
um
they

04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
other private owners uh own and operate
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
the regional larger high voltage
 
04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
transmission system and all of them
 
04:48:25.378 --> 04:48:26.510 align:start position:0%
transmission system and all of them
um

04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know those costs are what are
 
04:48:31.010 --> 04:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
submitted to the puc to go into rates
 
04:48:31.020 --> 04:48:32.750 align:start position:0%
submitted to the puc to go into rates
look

04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade the distribution system
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
no matter where the supply is coming
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
from we have to have a distribution
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
system and it has to be maintained and
 
04:48:43.550 --> 04:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
upgraded and made resilient so I don't I
 
04:48:47.090 --> 04:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
do not feel that uh requiring more uh
 
04:48:47.100 --> 04:48:48.190 align:start position:0%
do not feel that uh requiring more uh
solar

04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
solar
 
04:48:51.890 --> 04:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
would add increased transmission or
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
distribution costs in fact there's
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence that adding
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
distributed solar throughout the system
 
04:48:59.160 --> 04:49:01.070 align:start position:0%
distributed solar throughout the system
reduces

04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
reduces
 
04:49:02.810 --> 04:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
the need for expensive transmission
 
04:49:05.448 --> 04:49:05.458 align:start position:0%
upgrades because you're not having to
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
bring large amounts of bulk power from
 
04:49:10.368 --> 04:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
far away rather you are having small
 
04:49:13.490 --> 04:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
amounts of distributed generation put
 
04:49:15.128 --> 04:49:15.138 align:start position:0%
onto the grid
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the grid
 
04:49:21.490 --> 04:49:21.500 align:start position:0%
and where there are upgrades to
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
distribution to local Distribution
 
04:49:26.330 --> 04:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
Systems required
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
for example a project I worked on at
 
04:49:31.128 --> 04:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
revision energy before I left the town
 
04:49:33.610 --> 04:49:33.620 align:start position:0%
of Exeter contemplating a
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
1.8 megawatt
 
04:49:35.940 --> 04:49:37.430 align:start position:0%
1.8 megawatt
um

04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:40.628 --> 04:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
solar array on their landfill
 
04:49:43.010 --> 04:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
one of your most important steps is to
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
submit an interconnection application to
 
04:49:48.610 --> 04:49:48.620 align:start position:0%
eversource and say can the grid handle
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
1.8 megawatts of of input right here and
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
the utility studies that and they come
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
back and they say yes but with these
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
upgrades and they'll give a list of way
 
04:50:04.150 --> 04:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
we need this big giant it's called a
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
recloser it's like a utility grade
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
circuit breaker you'll have to you have
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
to install one of these and you might
 
04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
need to upgrade this and that those
 
04:50:13.970 --> 04:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
costs will actually be put onto the
 
04:50:16.250 --> 04:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
private cost of the of the Solar
 
04:50:18.170 --> 04:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
Development so
 
04:50:19.850 --> 04:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
um additional distributed solar actually
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
results in additional private investment
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the local distribution grid which
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
benefits everyone and so that's why
 
04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's some discussion another topic
 
04:50:29.930 --> 04:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
but at the puc about maybe socializing
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
those costs more because they do benefit
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
04:50:42.770 --> 04:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:50:44.330 --> 04:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds for uh
 
04:50:47.690 --> 04:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
testifying so eloquently on on your bill
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you're talking a lot about the the
 
04:50:52.490 --> 04:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
costs uh relative to distribution and
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
transmission I wonder if you as someone
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
who's worked in the field professionally
 
04:50:58.610 --> 04:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you have any notion of the
 
04:51:01.128 --> 04:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
knock-on knock-on benefits that would
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
come from
 
04:51:04.490 --> 04:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
employment figures say or small
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
businesses uh profits uh due to
 
04:51:10.610 --> 04:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
increased solar penetration on on the
 
04:51:12.170 --> 04:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire grid
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your for the
 
04:51:16.610 --> 04:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
question representative Kaplan I
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
certainly do because that's what my
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's what my role used to be in
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
commercial solar sales uh again given as
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
I said that the
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
um fuel cost of solar is zero
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
the uh all the cost of solar almost all
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
the costs you have to maintain a system
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's a little cost to that but almost
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
all the cost of a solar system is
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
capital up front by the system
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
and when you do that
 
04:51:47.628 --> 04:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
you can calculate
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
the engineering calculus says if you
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
build this solar system it's going to
 
04:51:54.650 --> 04:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
produce this many kilowatt hours of
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
energy per year for the next
 
04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
40 years and so up a a prudent business
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
or a prudent town
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
can say if we make that you know if it's
 
04:52:10.810 --> 04:52:10.820 align:start position:0%
town of Exeter five million dollar
 
04:52:14.690 --> 04:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
investment in this solar array
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
it's going to produce this many kilowatt
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
hours a year further next 40 years the
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
the levelized costs of those kilowatt
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
hours is
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
three and a half cents three and a half
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
cents a kilowatt hour
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah you can say and that's why
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
businesses private businesses from Bell
 
04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
Events Beverage Company and your
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
District representative Thomas have put
 
04:52:39.770 --> 04:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
a one megawatt solar array on their roof
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
of their building because the smart
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
businessman says
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
wow that's a good investment I can
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
protect myself from The Surge and boy
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
isn't he looking smart these days he's
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
getting all those kilowatt hours off his
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
Solar Ray and and not buying at 22 cents
 
04:52:58.850 --> 04:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour from the utility
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
great investment and same thing North
 
04:53:03.170 --> 04:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
Conway water Precinct 2 built a one
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar array boy are they
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking good to their rate payers
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
because they're they're running that
 
04:53:11.208 --> 04:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
plant on
 
04:53:14.570 --> 04:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
levelized costs solar power so much
 
04:53:16.490 --> 04:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
cheaper than
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
what what's on the market today
 
04:53:20.690 --> 04:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for answering that
 
04:53:20.700 --> 04:53:21.770 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for answering that
question

04:53:21.770 --> 04:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
representative regini has a question
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:53:27.050 --> 04:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a two-part
 
04:53:31.368 --> 04:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
question of the four classes which one
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
um has the lowest capacity Factor so my
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill refers to only class two uh
 
04:53:42.288 --> 04:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
solar PV so then my next question would
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
be why only increase Class 2 which is a
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
lower capacity Factor than all the
 
04:53:49.010 --> 04:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
others and not increase one of the other
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
ones that has a higher capacity effect I
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
was only interested in increasing the
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
RPS for solar uh that's my bill
 
04:53:58.368 --> 04:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
um I frankly the other I don't think
 
04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a lot more
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
development of new Hydro so I don't you
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
know it's not reasonable to increase the
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
percentage of hydro because that's hard
 
04:54:08.208 --> 04:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to really build any
 
04:54:09.250 --> 04:54:09.260 align:start position:0%
more of that
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
so my build just focuses on solar
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
because it's very doable
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
and it's uh 100 private investment that
 
04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
does it unless of course it's towns or
 
04:54:22.610 --> 04:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
counties that do it on behalf of of
 
04:54:25.010 --> 04:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so my bill just focuses on
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
question or did you have a follow-up no
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm just interested in lines 20 uh to
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
page two line two
 
04:54:43.490 --> 04:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
how did you come up with those numbers
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
are they
 
04:54:45.240 --> 04:54:45.890 align:start position:0%
are they
um

04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:47.570 --> 04:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
accepted numbers are they from another
 
04:54:47.580 --> 04:54:50.150 align:start position:0%
accepted numbers are they from another
state

04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
um they're just I thought that those
 
04:54:55.850 --> 04:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
levels were reasonable
 
04:54:59.090 --> 04:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're aspirational I took the I
 
04:55:01.730 --> 04:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
definitely took the took the view that
 
04:55:01.740 --> 04:55:03.470 align:start position:0%
definitely took the took the view that
uh

04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:06.368 --> 04:55:06.378 align:start position:0%
what exists must be possible
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at even those numbers you'll
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
see that they're lower than every other
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
state in New England already has
 
04:55:16.490 --> 04:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
and so I certainly didn't want to
 
04:55:18.890 --> 04:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
propose for new heaps or something that
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
was wildly aspirational or that people
 
04:55:25.368 --> 04:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
could say that's hardly achievable you
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
can look left right and and you can look
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
in every direction and see states that
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
have already have solar renewable
 
04:55:36.110 --> 04:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards that are stronger
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
than the numbers that I've proposed for
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire I also uh did
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
this with the with the certainty that of
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
course I'm putting into law numbers that
 
04:55:49.490 --> 04:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
would again it's aspirational set goals
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire through 2050.
 
04:55:56.810 --> 04:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you know if we get to 2030 and
 
04:55:58.850 --> 04:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's kind of looks like we
 
04:56:00.770 --> 04:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
topped out or anything more isn't
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
achievable it certainly would be within
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
the power of another
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to say oh you know maybe
 
04:56:09.890 --> 04:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
maybe that number you have for 20 40 or
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
2050 isn't reasonable we'll roll that
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
back but
 
04:56:14.990 --> 04:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
um in this case I'm trying to as I said
 
04:56:17.330 --> 04:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're trying to turn the giant ship and
 
04:56:19.570 --> 04:56:19.580 align:start position:0%
choose a destination
 
04:56:22.850 --> 04:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
for 30 years from now 28 years from now
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
27 and uh
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so I thought those were very
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable numbers follow up follow up
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
um so what would happen if we don't make
 
04:56:33.890 --> 04:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
the numbers in in each year is there a
 
04:56:35.510 --> 04:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
penalty or anything
 
04:56:37.368 --> 04:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
I mean this this is just changing the
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
numbers in the RPS so the RPS functions
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
that you know the utilities have to
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
acquire renewable energy
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
and when and when they do that they of
 
04:56:48.650 --> 04:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
course get the wrecks the energy came
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
from Renewables so they have the wrecks
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
or they make alternative compliance
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
payments but that's not
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know contemplated here because again
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
these are not super ambitious numbers
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:08.330 --> 04:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how much it would
 
04:57:09.958 --> 04:57:10.970 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how much it would
cost

04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
to jump
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
fairly radically from
 
04:57:17.570 --> 04:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
the current numbers of 0.7 percent to
 
04:57:19.330 --> 04:57:19.340 align:start position:0%
the 3
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
2.53 3.5 percent numbers that you uh
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
aspire to with this legislation I I
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't have that number but I actually
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a huge jump I think as
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the New Hampshire in
 
04:57:35.868 --> 04:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
the state where we're actually exceeding
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
the the anemic .07 number right now so I
 
04:57:42.050 --> 04:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's
 
04:57:42.060 --> 04:57:42.890 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's
um

04:57:42.890 --> 04:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that it we would be able to
 
04:57:45.840 --> 04:57:47.020 align:start position:0%
I I think that it we would be able to
achieve

04:57:47.020 --> 04:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:48.288 align:start position:0%
achieve
[Music]

04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
the three percent and the 3.5 fairly
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
easily and again
 
04:57:53.638 --> 04:57:54.288 align:start position:0%
easily and again
um

04:57:54.288 --> 04:57:54.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
if we didn't actually have all the
 
04:57:57.890 --> 04:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
remote which I'm confident that we do
 
04:58:00.590 --> 04:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
have their own renewable energy
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
um you know people would make
 
04:58:03.770 --> 04:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments and that
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism would function as desired by
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
cycling that money back into
 
04:58:10.610 --> 04:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh supporting the development of more
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy which would bring the
 
04:58:15.470 --> 04:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
price of wrecks down as we heard in
 
04:58:17.090 --> 04:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
testimony here before
 
04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
you think it's reasonable as a follow-up
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
you think it's reasonable to ask us to
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
support legislation that we don't know
 
04:58:26.570 --> 04:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
how much it's going to cost
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to gonna say this uh we I
 
04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
think we do a lot of things that we
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't don't know how much they cost from
 
04:58:42.410 --> 04:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
a totally different uh sphere I'm going
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
to pull the example of the educational
 
04:58:47.330 --> 04:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
Choice Bill last year that was passed
 
04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
they were the projected costs was some
 
04:58:52.010 --> 04:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
low number and it's turned out that it
 
04:58:55.010 --> 04:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
has cost the state way more than than it
 
04:58:57.890 --> 04:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
was projected I mean this is again
 
04:58:59.530 --> 04:58:59.540 align:start position:0%
um aspirational
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
but I believe easily achievable
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
we need
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
we need to Aspire to more basically
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
um you know when when John F Kennedy
 
04:59:12.410 --> 04:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
told told the country we were going to
 
04:59:15.890 --> 04:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
go to the moon in 1960 nobody
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
knew how much it was going to cost
 
04:59:19.250 --> 04:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
nobody people doubted it was even
 
04:59:19.260 --> 04:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
nobody people doubted it was even
possible

04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
but we did it
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
um this is we know how to do this this
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
is easy actually so I I'm not worried
 
04:59:30.170 --> 04:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
about that it's going to be an onerous
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
cost given what I said about the zero
 
04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
fuel costs it's just really all about
 
04:59:36.288 --> 04:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
sparking the investment sending that
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
market signal to get more solar into the
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
market and I actually believe it will be
 
04:59:43.010 --> 04:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
substantial benefit to the ratepayers of
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
so as another follow-up federal policy
 
04:59:49.638 --> 04:59:51.490 align:start position:0%
so as another follow-up federal policy
recently

04:59:51.490 --> 04:59:51.500 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
signed into law by President Biden
 
04:59:58.610 --> 04:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
provides for a permanent 7 500 dollar
 
05:00:02.690 --> 05:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
a tax credit to individuals who purchase
 
05:00:04.730 --> 05:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
rooftop solar
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
it also made permanent investment tax
 
05:00:09.770 --> 05:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
credits for commercial Enterprises that
 
05:00:12.890 --> 05:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
with all that support from the federal
 
05:00:17.330 --> 05:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
government do you still think it's
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
necessary to add additional support at
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
the state level to to stimulate the
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
adoption of renewable energy absolutely
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
and in fact I think that what you those
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
that those facts you just cited all
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
those first of all the the investment
 
05:00:37.368 --> 05:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
tax credit for business investment in
 
05:00:39.530 --> 05:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
solar and residential has existed for a
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
long time uh it was just sort of a
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
political football all the time and it
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
was in danger so it would it would
 
05:00:49.550 --> 05:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
result in in sort of stop start you know
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
on inconsistent Market signal but so
 
05:00:54.650 --> 05:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
you're right they made it permanent in
 
05:00:58.010 --> 05:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
the in the ira but that those two things
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
will dramatically lower the cost of such
 
05:01:05.208 --> 05:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
an aspirational uh goal as as increasing
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
the RPS because businesses and and
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
people that want to do it are going to
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
have that much more financial support
 
05:01:13.850 --> 05:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
for it so more reason to to do it I
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
think we still need the market signal in
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and do it does it really
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
lower the cost or does it just simply
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
transfer the cost to someone else namely
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
the American taxpayer
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
um you know again uh the the more solar
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
on the grid refer back to the iso
 
05:01:36.050 --> 05:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
refer back to the iso graph the more
 
05:01:37.970 --> 05:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
solar on the grid depresses the regional
 
05:01:41.530 --> 05:01:41.540 align:start position:0%
demand depresses Regional price reduces
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
stress on
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
the regional grid reduces need for long
 
05:01:48.490 --> 05:01:48.500 align:start position:0%
distance transmission
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a big benefit and I haven't
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
even said one word yet about the
 
05:01:55.610 --> 05:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits of more solar
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
which are very real and which people who
 
05:02:00.910 --> 05:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
have uh suffer from
 
05:02:03.850 --> 05:02:03.860 align:start position:0%
COPD or asthma
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of of our dependence on fossil
 
05:02:10.128 --> 05:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
fuels for power generation especially at
 
05:02:13.490 --> 05:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
peak times very real costs so I'm not
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
even talking about those costs but they
 
05:02:17.330 --> 05:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
are very significant and very real so I
 
05:02:19.330 --> 05:02:19.340 align:start position:0%
believe that there's significant savings
 
05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you also said that we
 
05:02:25.970 --> 05:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
should not concern ourselves with
 
05:02:25.980 --> 05:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
should not concern ourselves with
intermittency

05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
intermittency
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
but isn't intermittency a huge risk for
 
05:02:30.780 --> 05:02:32.090 align:start position:0%
but isn't intermittency a huge risk for
reliability

05:02:32.090 --> 05:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
I I said that because I said the
 
05:02:36.000 --> 05:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
I I said that because I said the
regional

05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
regional
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
Market structures already account for
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
intermittency I said as policy makers we
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
ought not to write off Renewables
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
because they're intermittent everyone
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
understands that they're intermittent
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the market accounts for that by
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
discounting them in the forward capacity
 
05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
Market that's why the capacity Factor
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
but that's it's already built in we we
 
05:03:03.410 --> 05:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
say that we want to
 
05:03:05.930 --> 05:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
have the market work
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
then let the market work it you know we
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
have Market structures that account for
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
the intermittency
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
and solar is used when it's available
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
if the markets were working
 
05:03:21.770 --> 05:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't people be able be in uh
 
05:03:24.650 --> 05:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
motivated to purchase Solar without
 
05:03:30.850 --> 05:03:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
the service it provides and its price
 
05:03:36.890 --> 05:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
the market the energy Market that we
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
have uh is you know an evolution of
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
something that was invented over a
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
decade over a century ago it's a
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
government sanctioned highly regulated
 
05:03:55.010 --> 05:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
Monopoly uh by necessity and for public
 
05:03:57.250 --> 05:03:57.260 align:start position:0%
good but the structures in that market
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
are still uh tilted toward
 
05:04:01.798 --> 05:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
are still uh tilted toward
um

05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know fossil fuels Supply it's easier
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
to get large fossil fuel supply than it
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:04:10.020 --> 05:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
is to
um

05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
incentivize and get small distributed
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
solar that's why in the renewable
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
portfolio itself and the brexits
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
themselves are Market they were invented
 
05:04:23.090 --> 05:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
to be part of the market and we just
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
need to have consistent policy to let
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
those Market structures work
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
so not increasing the RPS so for years
 
05:04:33.650 --> 05:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
and years you know at every other state
 
05:04:36.530 --> 05:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
has and we are benefiting from it that's
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
what the first ISO graph shows but we're
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
not doing our part so we just need to do
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:04:51.288 --> 05:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
again representative uh just to give us
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a granular view of
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
what it means to do our part
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're going in 2025 uh
 
05:05:00.770 --> 05:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
fourfold increase from point seven to
 
05:05:03.890 --> 05:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
three three percent minimum what uh just
 
05:05:06.288 --> 05:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
to take 2025 as a baseline what are our
 
05:05:08.208 --> 05:05:08.218 align:start position:0%
neighbor States what kind of minimums do
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
they have for solar well I just put them
 
05:05:12.410 --> 05:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
I I meant to you know put them right
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
there for us all to see
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
um there's significantly significantly
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
05:05:23.520 --> 05:05:25.070 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
nope

05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
nope
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's why it took you know
 
05:05:30.050 --> 05:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
because of intermittency don't we need
 
05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
to then build out a reliable source of
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
power in order to ensure we have power
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
when we need it
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
well no respectfully again the
 
05:05:49.250 --> 05:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
intermittency is already accounted for
 
05:05:51.288 --> 05:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
in the market structure of iso New
 
05:05:53.448 --> 05:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
England solar's availability is heavily
 
05:05:53.458 --> 05:05:55.090 align:start position:0%
England solar's availability is heavily
discounted

05:05:55.090 --> 05:05:55.100 align:start position:0%
discounted
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
so when they do the forward capacity
 
05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
Market that's what they're doing what
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
she just said ensure we have reliable
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
backups or you say backup sources of
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
power the thing about the the grid of
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
course and our usage is
 
05:06:11.930 --> 05:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
um usage and demand is highly variable
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
over 24 hour period so solar becomes
 
05:06:16.368 --> 05:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
available obviously during the day
 
05:06:20.330 --> 05:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's when we can dial back the fossil
 
05:06:23.690 --> 05:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
fuel-fired power plants and so nobody's
 
05:06:26.448 --> 05:06:26.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not against natural gas fired power
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
plants we need them both but we need
 
05:06:32.930 --> 05:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
more solar and the bet we have the
 
05:06:34.970 --> 05:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
benefit of more storage as again we
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
heard from another testifier within the
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
last couple of weeks how storage
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
Technologies are coming
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
coming on and now being proposed in
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the Renewables to
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
address the intermittency so now it
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
won't be completely Renewables are
 
05:06:52.430 --> 05:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
completely unavailable you'll generate
 
05:06:54.288 --> 05:06:54.298 align:start position:0%
during the middle of the day store it
 
05:06:57.170 --> 05:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
and address that Peak at five and six
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
o'clock even with Renewables so we have
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
that back up if you will reliability in
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
the market it does that it's designed to
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
do that follow-up with all due respect
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
we do not have the battery storage
 
05:07:14.810 --> 05:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
capacity now and what's been discussed
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
does only last for four hours so my
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
question concerned don't we need to
 
05:07:25.010 --> 05:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
ensure through reliable manuf reliable
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
power sources that we have that
 
05:07:27.240 --> 05:07:29.448 align:start position:0%
power sources that we have that
capability

05:07:29.448 --> 05:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
capability
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
um throughout an entire day
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
we polish we New Hampshire legislators
 
05:07:37.250 --> 05:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
don't need to the New England
 
05:07:39.770 --> 05:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and the power generators
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
Association of New England are
 
05:07:56.090 --> 05:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify you're talking about
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
a gradual incentive working up to
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
certain levels of Solar Usage or were
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
you hoping to implement everything all
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
at once
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
no the um the bill is all about
 
05:08:15.120 --> 05:08:16.670 align:start position:0%
no the um the bill is all about
increasing

05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
05:08:19.250 --> 05:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's renewable portfolio
 
05:08:23.208 --> 05:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
standard very gradually
 
05:08:23.218 --> 05:08:24.550 align:start position:0%
standard very gradually
from

05:08:24.550 --> 05:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:08:27.948 --> 05:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
2024 to 2050
 
05:08:29.930 --> 05:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know as the numbers show so it's
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's gradual increase in solar
 
05:08:36.410 --> 05:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.330 --> 05:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
so there would be a mixture of
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding right using both
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuels that we have already at
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
hand as well as the onboarding of more
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
and more solar energy at the same time
 
05:08:55.490 --> 05:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
kind of a transition from one to the
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
other yes absolutely that's I mean
 
05:08:59.930 --> 05:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's what we have now is a portfolio
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
of sources and the regional grid
 
05:09:05.810 --> 05:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
operator manages that and so it's just
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
about gradually
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of solar I mean
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
thanks to the other State's policies
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's what ISO New England showed us
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
that is expected to happen so like I say
 
05:09:20.930 --> 05:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's just it's just about getting
 
05:09:22.970 --> 05:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to do even
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
close to what the other states are
 
05:09:25.320 --> 05:09:26.208 align:start position:0%
close to what the other states are
already

05:09:26.208 --> 05:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:34.010 --> 05:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
05:09:34.020 --> 05:09:35.270 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
Corman

05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking about
 
05:09:42.890 --> 05:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
um chairman Bose's comments about uh a
 
05:09:44.208 --> 05:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
free market
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
and uh you know clearly this is some
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
intrusion or let's say influence on the
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
market for solar
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of uh government uh
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
influence on the market for fossil fuels
 
05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
and government support for for creating
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
those just I mean in terms of having a
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field well sure I would I
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
would say that that's what that's the
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
default of of our system we have now in
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
my opening remarks I I sort of
 
05:10:15.360 --> 05:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
my opening remarks I I sort of
um

05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:20.208 --> 05:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
colloquially describe the the rate
 
05:10:22.970 --> 05:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
setting process at the puc as every six
 
05:10:26.448 --> 05:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
months the utilities come and they say
 
05:10:29.090 --> 05:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
this is the price of fossil fuels
 
05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
and these are therefore these are the
 
05:10:32.570 --> 05:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
rates we need to charge
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
and because the system is so highly
 
05:10:37.970 --> 05:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
dependent on fossil fuels the puc says
 
05:10:39.770 --> 05:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
ouch that boy in this case that really
 
05:10:41.930 --> 05:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
hurt but open but okay
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
you know they can't say no
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
so that's where we get it's okay forever
 
05:10:49.490 --> 05:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
sources rates to be 22 and a half cents
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour because the fossil fuel
 
05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
which price is set on the global market
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
pass through to us
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we have one more person
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
who wants to testify on this bill so I'm
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
going to thank you for introducing it
 
05:11:06.288 --> 05:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman answering all our
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions and ask Griffin Roberts from
 
05:11:10.610 --> 05:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to give us his
 
05:11:21.490 --> 05:11:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record Griffin
 
05:11:26.810 --> 05:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
Rovers from the New Hampshire Department
 
05:11:28.430 --> 05:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
um depending on the any questions that I
 
05:11:32.570 --> 05:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
might receive I have a hard stop at 2 30
 
05:11:35.330 --> 05:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
as I have to leave
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
um regarding the other two bills this
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon House Bill 616 and 622 uh the
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
department will not be here to testify
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
on that those bills however we have
 
05:11:43.920 --> 05:11:45.430 align:start position:0%
on that those bills however we have
provided

05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
letters of testimony uh to the committee
 
05:11:49.970 --> 05:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
through the online portal if anybody has
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
any questions obviously feel free to
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
reach out anytime
 
05:11:57.410 --> 05:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
um circling back to house bill 605 the
 
05:11:59.330 --> 05:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
department is neutral
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
um as as it is uh introduced here the
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill as has been discussed makes two
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
primary changes to class two under the
 
05:12:09.770 --> 05:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard it makes an
 
05:12:11.570 --> 05:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
immediate increase to class two's
 
05:12:13.610 --> 05:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
obligation for electricity providers
 
05:12:16.010 --> 05:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
from the current point seven zero
 
05:12:19.490 --> 05:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
percent to two point 0.5 percent in 2024
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
and then it gradually increases the
 
05:12:24.170 --> 05:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
class two obligations at the increasing
 
05:12:24.180 --> 05:12:25.730 align:start position:0%
class two obligations at the increasing
increments

05:12:25.730 --> 05:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
increments
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
um up to 25 by 2050 as detailed on page
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
one line 20 uh onto page two line two
 
05:12:35.040 --> 05:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
one line 20 uh onto page two line two
um

05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
electricity providers under this bill
 
05:12:39.410 --> 05:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
will need to purchase an increased
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
amount of class II uh renewable energy
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
credits or wrecks to satisfy the
 
05:12:47.208 --> 05:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
increased class two obligations it is
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
assumed that some of the uh obligation
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
will be met by electricity providers
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
making alternative compliance payments
 
05:12:57.708 --> 05:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
or acps to the renewable energy fund
 
05:13:01.690 --> 05:13:01.700 align:start position:0%
currently the rate for Class 2 acps is
 
05:13:06.770 --> 05:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
59.12 and the ACP is indexed to half of
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Price Index and is adjusted
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
every year given that Rex operate in a
 
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
regional market it's difficult to assume
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
what portion of an electricity
 
05:13:17.330 --> 05:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
provider's obligation will be met by
 
05:13:20.270 --> 05:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
either purchasing wrecks or making acps
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
overall the Inc the increase in class 2
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
requirements will result likely in an
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in RPS
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
compliance costs again either through
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
electricity providers uh purchasing
 
05:13:37.490 --> 05:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
um renewable energy credits wrecks or
 
05:13:39.470 --> 05:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
making alternative compliance payments
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
and again as I think we all know those
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
costs are recovered by electricity
 
05:13:46.448 --> 05:13:46.458 align:start position:0%
providers rate payers as well
 
05:13:50.090 --> 05:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
doe did provide a revised fiscal note
 
05:13:50.100 --> 05:13:51.230 align:start position:0%
doe did provide a revised fiscal note
dated

05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
dated
 
05:13:55.730 --> 05:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
January 12 and we outline in that fiscal
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
note some of the bills maximum impacts
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
to electric rates I would reiterate to
 
05:14:02.330 --> 05:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
the committee that these figures are
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
assumptions and actual bill impacts are
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
hard to predict given the rec Market
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
fluctuations year to year and with that
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to answer any
 
05:14:17.770 --> 05:14:17.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative buns
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:14:25.010 --> 05:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
again for being here thank you um
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
I wanted to follow up on the the the
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and you know the the numbers
 
05:14:31.970 --> 05:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
that are included in there because
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're you know they are very large and
 
05:14:37.970 --> 05:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.448 --> 05:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
sorry one of the things that um
 
05:14:44.208 --> 05:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
that I that that that's missing and I
 
05:14:47.208 --> 05:14:47.218 align:start position:0%
wonder if that data is available is
 
05:14:50.270 --> 05:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
we we we're only showing a little piece
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle when we show that there's
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
potential additional ACP costs of 46
 
05:14:57.650 --> 05:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:14:57.660 --> 05:14:59.208 align:start position:0%
million dollars
because

05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:15:02.510 --> 05:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
um there's also a there isn't there is
 
05:15:04.610 --> 05:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
an impact on rates but there's also
 
05:15:08.448 --> 05:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
hopefully a impact on
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
the a positive or A positive impact on
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
rates as well
 
05:15:15.288 --> 05:15:15.298 align:start position:0%
and we don't we we never get that
 
05:15:18.050 --> 05:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
analysis is that type of analysis
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
available does the department of energy
 
05:15:22.850 --> 05:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
have that there there has to be some
 
05:15:24.910 --> 05:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
correlation between
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
increased expenditures and Renewables
 
05:15:30.050 --> 05:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
and what the impact is we're you know
 
05:15:32.810 --> 05:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
and granted I've only been on this
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
committee for a couple weeks now but we
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
never see that we never see what the
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
impact is sure
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question so
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the figures um in the fiscal
 
05:15:42.360 --> 05:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
regarding the figures um in the fiscal
note

05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
note
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
um it is as I mentioned it is an
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
assumption that um the level of
 
05:15:49.730 --> 05:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
electricity the total sale of
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
electricity from electricity providers
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
remains constant at 2021 levels that
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
inflation uh increases two percent a
 
05:16:00.530 --> 05:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
year and uh it's assumed that the entire
 
05:16:02.890 --> 05:16:02.900 align:start position:0%
increased obligation is met through acps
 
05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
as you know we've discussed acps is the
 
05:16:08.690 --> 05:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
higher cost of maintaining
 
05:16:10.970 --> 05:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
um RPS compliance for electricity
 
05:16:14.690 --> 05:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
providers so the these figures uh
 
05:16:16.250 --> 05:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
represent as we know in the last
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the fiscal note indicate
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
the maximum potential increase to
 
05:16:24.170 --> 05:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
Statewide electricity costs regarding
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
um the positive impact of of RPS
 
05:16:27.958 --> 05:16:29.570 align:start position:0%
um the positive impact of of RPS
Investments

05:16:29.570 --> 05:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
05:16:31.010 --> 05:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
um there certainly is an argument to be
 
05:16:33.170 --> 05:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
made that it redu that these types of
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
Investments reduce
 
05:16:36.770 --> 05:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
um not only Regional transmission costs
 
05:16:38.690 --> 05:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
but a state's allocation of transmission
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
costs I can take a deeper dive within
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
the department to see if we might be
 
05:16:45.890 --> 05:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
able to work up a number for the
 
05:16:47.390 --> 05:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee to have as a reference point
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
but it's not necessarily something that
 
05:16:51.288 --> 05:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
we develop ourselves every year in
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
reporting and that type of thing because
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
rep prices fluctuate so much within the
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
market it's difficult to predict where
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
they might be in the future acps are set
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
in statute so they're relatively static
 
05:17:04.128 --> 05:17:04.138 align:start position:0%
so we can make some assumptions there
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
but circling back to your point as to
 
05:17:09.288 --> 05:17:09.298 align:start position:0%
the the benefits of the RPS is I think
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
you and I have discussed it is difficult
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
to quantify the that
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
holistically for all of the projects
 
05:17:18.170 --> 05:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
because that requires some depth of an
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
economic analysis which we as a
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
department do not necessarily have but I
 
05:17:23.810 --> 05:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
can certainly see what resources we
 
05:17:25.010 --> 05:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
might have
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
um from ISO in terms of maybe reducing
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
transmission costs but I believe tell me
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I believe that
 
05:17:32.448 --> 05:17:32.458 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds might have
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
provided information with his testimony
 
05:17:34.440 --> 05:17:36.590 align:start position:0%
provided information with his testimony
follow-up

05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:17:36.600 --> 05:17:38.090 align:start position:0%
follow-up
oh

05:17:38.090 --> 05:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:17:41.628 --> 05:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I would just caution sharing
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
numbers like this when it only includes
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
a part of the of the story yep and it's
 
05:17:51.170 --> 05:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
misleading no no and um and and you know
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
and if the department doesn't have that
 
05:17:56.448 --> 05:17:56.458 align:start position:0%
kind of analytical capability I would
 
05:17:58.128 --> 05:17:58.138 align:start position:0%
suggest that as part of the budgeting
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
process you look to get that because you
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
know without that it's very difficult to
 
05:18:06.970 --> 05:18:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I would remind the committee
 
05:18:13.128 --> 05:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
uh to please make references to the bill
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
05:18:23.040 --> 05:18:24.170 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:26.810 --> 05:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
I just have one really quick question uh
 
05:18:30.530 --> 05:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
regarding uh this bill here a simple
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
answer is there
 
05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
anything in New Hampshire state
 
05:18:38.570 --> 05:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
regulations that prevent
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
solar from being put on anyone's roof at
 
05:18:43.690 --> 05:18:43.700 align:start position:0%
all any regulation that prevents it now
 
05:18:43.700 --> 05:18:45.310 align:start position:0%
all any regulation that prevents it now
uh

05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
something an outright regulation on that
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
no maybe there might be an indirect one
 
05:18:52.010 --> 05:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
or something like that maybe like an
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
environmental impact but on the whole no
 
05:18:54.298 --> 05:18:55.670 align:start position:0%
environmental impact but on the whole no
oh

05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:18:58.730 --> 05:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
follow up so okay so can I assume then
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
that um that a person can go and
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
purchase a solar panel and put it on his
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
roof now even even without this bill
 
05:19:10.490 --> 05:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.090 --> 05:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
um since I'm the numbers guy I'll ask
 
05:19:18.650 --> 05:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
another numbers question
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
um hopefully simple
 
05:19:22.368 --> 05:19:22.378 align:start position:0%
um the standard
 
05:19:25.788 --> 05:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
um for class two currently
 
05:19:29.570 --> 05:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.7 where
 
05:19:31.850 --> 05:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
are we actually uh thank you for the
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
question 0.7 is where we currently stand
 
05:19:37.070 --> 05:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
and that's that's
 
05:19:40.190 --> 05:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
expected to where it will remain
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
up to 2025 and Beyond follow-up under
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
current statute follow-up I'm I just
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it was clear I
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
mean what the what what is the actual
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
performance not this not not what's
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
wrong oh you're talking about oh I
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
thought you're talking about the
 
05:19:56.208 --> 05:19:56.218 align:start position:0%
obligation I'm sorry
 
05:19:56.218 --> 05:19:57.890 align:start position:0%
obligation I'm sorry
um

05:19:57.890 --> 05:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.170 --> 05:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the the actual performance I'm
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
sorry well there's a standard of points
 
05:20:07.970 --> 05:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
between you know 0.7 yeah where are we
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we've actually where we
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually are in terms of I'm sorry
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
against that standard we measure that
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
each compliance year
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
um which tends to map out each uh tends
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
to follow the state's fiscal year so a
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
lot of that data is reconciled at the
 
05:20:23.930 --> 05:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year to find out how
 
05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers have met their
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
obligation so I couldn't provide that
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
information right now but for a previous
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
compliance here much of that data is in
 
05:20:34.910 --> 05:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
the uh renewable energy fund annual
 
05:20:36.530 --> 05:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
report that I Pro that provided that's
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
the report I was looking for thank you
 
05:20:39.770 --> 05:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
did you need me to provide that to the
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
community okay that's it
 
05:20:44.690 --> 05:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
representative partial you had a
 
05:20:44.700 --> 05:20:47.030 align:start position:0%
representative partial you had a
question

05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.040 --> 05:20:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:20:48.410 --> 05:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions uh
 
05:20:53.330 --> 05:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
for Mr Roberts we'll let him get off
 
05:20:55.730 --> 05:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
on his way to Washington D.C thank you
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and I hope you
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
make it to the airport on time
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
next up we'll invite Jennifer Smith from
 
05:21:04.080 --> 05:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
next up we'll invite Jennifer Smith from
Pembroke

05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
Pembroke
 
05:21:12.890 --> 05:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.610 --> 05:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you chairman Ross
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
I I feel moved to to speak um because I
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
I just begin to feel like we have this
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
argument going on about whether this
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't just be done through free
 
05:21:31.080 --> 05:21:32.868 align:start position:0%
couldn't just be done through free
markets

05:21:32.868 --> 05:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
markets
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
I am not an economist I'm a physician
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
retired physician with a public health
 
05:21:37.378 --> 05:21:38.690 align:start position:0%
retired physician with a public health
degree

05:21:38.690 --> 05:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
degree
 
05:21:43.128 --> 05:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
I also own 20 kilowatts of solar on two
 
05:21:43.138 --> 05:21:44.208 align:start position:0%
I also own 20 kilowatts of solar on two
roofs

05:21:44.208 --> 05:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
roofs
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I didn't do that because I thought
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
that I was going to make a killing doing
 
05:21:48.958 --> 05:21:50.570 align:start position:0%
that I was going to make a killing doing
that

05:21:50.570 --> 05:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
I I did it because of what are known as
 
05:21:53.700 --> 05:21:55.730 align:start position:0%
I I did it because of what are known as
externalities

05:21:55.730 --> 05:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
externalities
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
and externalities are never valued in
 
05:22:01.550 --> 05:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
the free market unless they're forced on
 
05:22:04.368 --> 05:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
people by government
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
and that is in fact why so many places
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
are pushing hard on clean energy and I
 
05:22:14.930 --> 05:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate
 
05:22:17.570 --> 05:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:22:20.270 --> 05:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
my father was an economist unfortunately
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
he died at 65 while working on how do
 
05:22:25.730 --> 05:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
you value externalities for the
 
05:22:25.740 --> 05:22:27.770 align:start position:0%
you value externalities for the
environment

05:22:27.770 --> 05:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:22:30.410 --> 05:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's still a very unresolved question
 
05:22:33.650 --> 05:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
there is in fact a docket that is
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing about
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
valuing the um
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
contributions of
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
the energy in terms of just the standard
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
economic models because it's not a free
 
05:22:51.410 --> 05:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
market we all know that
 
05:22:54.650 --> 05:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's a highly regulated Monopoly
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
so let's be real about that
 
05:23:01.850 --> 05:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
the ACP payments and to representative
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
Munn's point I get twenty dollars
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
or my
 
05:23:11.330 --> 05:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
the ACP payments are I believe still 55.
 
05:23:17.390 --> 05:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're getting a lot from
 
05:23:19.730 --> 05:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
the ACP payments so that's kind of a
 
05:23:21.470 --> 05:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
bogus number to say what were the
 
05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
maximum amounts of acps that would be
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
resulted that our utilities would have
 
05:23:27.708 --> 05:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're paying a whole lot less for the
 
05:23:30.360 --> 05:23:32.270 align:start position:0%
they're paying a whole lot less for the
wrecks

05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
05:23:34.868 --> 05:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
and yeah the wrecks are important
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
although fewer projects get
 
05:23:40.430 --> 05:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
value from that anymore
 
05:23:42.970 --> 05:23:42.980 align:start position:0%
because we had to go to auctions my
 
05:23:47.330 --> 05:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
solar was put up 2015 2018.
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
and so I did manage it but it was
 
05:23:52.730 --> 05:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
difficult and the larger project really
 
05:23:56.690 --> 05:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
depended on USDA Grant to make it work
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
we need to have a lot more clean energy
 
05:24:04.010 --> 05:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
the costs the externalities in terms of
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
the impact on people's health
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
and they are substantial are not born
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
equally and those people living out in
 
05:24:15.368 --> 05:24:15.378 align:start position:0%
nice neighborhoods of New Hampshire
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't understand as far as I'm concerned
 
05:24:21.650 --> 05:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
how much damage fossil fuels are still
 
05:24:24.410 --> 05:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
doing have done and are still doing and
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
we're only beginning to scratch the
 
05:24:26.700 --> 05:24:27.890 align:start position:0%
we're only beginning to scratch the
surface

05:24:27.890 --> 05:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
surface
 
05:24:30.890 --> 05:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
of just how serious that is
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
so I hope
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
that people will stop just arguing free
 
05:24:39.650 --> 05:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
market economics when they look at this
 
05:24:41.570 --> 05:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be happy to take
 
05:24:41.580 --> 05:24:43.368 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be happy to take
questions

05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:24:46.010 --> 05:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:24:48.288 --> 05:24:48.298 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to start the next hearing at
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
2 30 so if you have questions please
 
05:24:53.208 --> 05:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
make them brief representative partial
 
05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
like sure of those
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
um this question I had earlier but maybe
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
you could answer it um
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that in the past our our
 
05:25:03.650 --> 05:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices were at a lower level
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
making solar less competitive to invest
 
05:25:07.320 --> 05:25:08.930 align:start position:0%
making solar less competitive to invest
in

05:25:08.930 --> 05:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:25:08.940 --> 05:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
in
um

05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:11.810 --> 05:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
but if we had done so and joined with
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
our New England neighbors that time do
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
you think that would have an effect on
 
05:25:18.170 --> 05:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
Today's Energy prices yeah I think it
 
05:25:20.448 --> 05:25:20.458 align:start position:0%
probably would because there would be a
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
lot more in our state and therefore the
 
05:25:25.490 --> 05:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
distribution costs would be down because
 
05:25:28.128 --> 05:25:28.138 align:start position:0%
those little places out there are having
 
05:25:30.590 --> 05:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
solar on them reduces distribution costs
 
05:25:32.330 --> 05:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
because my neighbors use the electricity
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm producing between
 
05:25:41.570 --> 05:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
the late afternoon and the early evening
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
I did oh somebody else thanks for that
 
05:25:44.638 --> 05:25:46.330 align:start position:0%
I did oh somebody else thanks for that
answer

05:25:46.330 --> 05:25:46.340 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no more questions
 
05:25:51.840 --> 05:25:53.628 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no more questions
for

05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:25:55.730 --> 05:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
um Ms Smith
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
I thank you for being here and with that
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on House
 
05:25:59.878 --> 05:26:00.830 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on House

administration of the New Hampshire's
 
05:32:07.010 --> 05:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
introduce the sponsor of the bill
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mark McLean from
 
05:32:12.000 --> 05:32:13.208 align:start position:0%

Mr chair
 
05:32:28.128 --> 05:32:28.138 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Science Tech
 
05:32:31.250 --> 05:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
and energy committee my name is
 
05:32:34.190 --> 05:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mark McLean representing
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro district 15 which is
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I kind of view this
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
committee as one of the the Brain Trust
 
05:32:44.208 --> 05:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
the legislature so
 
05:32:46.550 --> 05:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm offering this testimony with
 
05:32:48.890 --> 05:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
great humility and I hope you will
 
05:32:51.288 --> 05:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
accept it in the spirit that it's being
 
05:32:52.970 --> 05:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
offered so
 
05:32:52.980 --> 05:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
offered so
um

05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
HB uh 6 16 basically
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
um is a bill that is looking at the
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard broadly
 
05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
speaking it's uh divided up into two
 
05:33:11.150 --> 05:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
categories the first category is
 
05:33:14.330 --> 05:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
basically looking at the transferability
 
05:33:18.590 --> 05:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
of uh of the wrecks so basically
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
um it allows a wreck that is you know
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
obtained from one class to be used
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
basically fungibly and
 
05:33:30.650 --> 05:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
um the second part of the standards is
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
the creation of of a new class for new
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
nuclear so obviously the members of this
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee would know we're not talking
 
05:33:39.650 --> 05:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
about Seabrook or something like that
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the standard pressurized water reactor
 
05:33:43.930 --> 05:33:43.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking new nuclear going forward
 
05:33:48.170 --> 05:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
so the bill is uh fully supported uh by
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy I've had some
 
05:33:51.410 --> 05:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
conversations today with the folks there
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
and they see the bill as being full
 
05:33:56.448 --> 05:33:56.458 align:start position:0%
fully in sync with their 10-year energy
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
strategy unfortunately when I spoke to
 
05:34:00.170 --> 05:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
them they're not going to be able to
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
come here to testify today but they did
 
05:34:05.690 --> 05:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
send in testimony in support of the bill
 
05:34:07.730 --> 05:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair and it should be
 
05:34:10.010 --> 05:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
available for the clerk
 
05:34:13.010 --> 05:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to go first of all and just
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
look at part one of the bill which is
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
basically you know the renewable energy
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
certificates and basically being able to
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
to transfer them from from one area to
 
05:34:26.690 --> 05:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
the other and so what was the thinking
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
behind that so my thinking was I think
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
if I go back and put myself in the mind
 
05:34:33.890 --> 05:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the creators of the renewable
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard I think what they
 
05:34:38.330 --> 05:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
were trying to do at that point in time
 
05:34:40.850 --> 05:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
was create kind of a New Hampshire
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
primary of Renewables so basically
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're creating many different classes
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
where all the different Renewables can
 
05:34:50.690 --> 05:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
come in they have a swin Lane that kind
 
05:34:52.730 --> 05:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
of protects them a little bit and gives
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
them a chance to to show their stuff you
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
know show everybody in the state you
 
05:34:58.730 --> 05:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
know what their strengths are and kind
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
of make their case and that's that's
 
05:35:03.170 --> 05:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
been the status quo for for a few
 
05:35:07.788 --> 05:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
decades now but I think now having given
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
everybody a chance to to get out there
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
air and show what they're made of it's
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
time to kind of move beyond the primary
 
05:35:17.390 --> 05:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
stage with the removal renewable
 
05:35:19.970 --> 05:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard and get into the
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
general election as it were and to
 
05:35:25.490 --> 05:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
really start to understand what are
 
05:35:28.368 --> 05:35:28.378 align:start position:0%
those Renewables that are the best fit
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that Renewables are
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
ready yet to compete with
 
05:35:37.368 --> 05:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based energy if they were then
 
05:35:39.650 --> 05:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need the renewable portfolio
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
standard so I think as they're getting
 
05:35:44.090 --> 05:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
better and better and better and more
 
05:35:46.010 --> 05:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
cost effective there may be and
 
05:35:48.410 --> 05:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be a time when that comes
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
to be but they're not there yet but I do
 
05:35:54.830 --> 05:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
think we are now at a point in time
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
where the Renewables are ready to
 
05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
compete with each other and so the
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
thinking with this bill is that viable
 
05:36:06.650 --> 05:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
options have to be given the room to
 
05:36:09.288 --> 05:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
grow and even if that means you're going
 
05:36:11.448 --> 05:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
to have to squeeze out some of the less
 
05:36:13.490 --> 05:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
viable options and maybe some of those
 
05:36:15.470 --> 05:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
less viable options are going to have to
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
be sacrificed so that those are a better
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
fit for New Hampshire is they're going
 
05:36:23.448 --> 05:36:23.458 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to grow basically
 
05:36:26.770 --> 05:36:26.780 align:start position:0%
a wreck is a wreck in this legislation
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
so under this bill if one renewable
 
05:36:33.610 --> 05:36:33.620 align:start position:0%
crosses into another swim Lane so be it
 
05:36:37.730 --> 05:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
one thing of note though is that when I
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
was originally looking to put in this
 
05:36:42.650 --> 05:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
bill I was thinking is it time to just
 
05:36:46.190 --> 05:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
go beyond the class system altogether
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
and just just let's just have a
 
05:36:50.690 --> 05:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
classless renewable portfolio standard
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
and so in the iterations that I had with
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
the folks down at OLS they they really
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
counseled against that and I kind of
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
came around to their mode of thinking
 
05:37:03.170 --> 05:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I think really at this point we
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
still want to preserve the definitions
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
that we have within the classes and one
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
of the examples that they brought back
 
05:37:10.850 --> 05:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
to me as well you don't want to go and
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
have somebody burning tires for example
 
05:37:16.550 --> 05:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
and that's biomass so that that is why
 
05:37:19.250 --> 05:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
the bill uses the approach of retaining
 
05:37:21.770 --> 05:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
the classes retaining the definitions
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
but just allowing for that trend
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
transferability between the classes
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
the second part of the legislation
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
basically creates a new class class 5
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
for new nukes to be fourth generation
 
05:37:39.288 --> 05:37:39.298 align:start position:0%
molten salt reactors things of that
 
05:37:43.610 --> 05:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
nature and my thinking behind that is
 
05:37:46.448 --> 05:37:46.458 align:start position:0%
if for example I look at a country like
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
Switzerland Switzerland is a country
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
that really has been on the Forefront of
 
05:37:56.690 --> 05:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
pursuing Renewables in its attempt to go
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
after climate change and
 
05:38:02.448 --> 05:38:02.458 align:start position:0%
as they've expanded their Renewables
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
more and more and more they started to
 
05:38:06.350 --> 05:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
say okay we really want to be
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
incorporating some of these Renewables
 
05:38:10.430 --> 05:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
into the base load as well but the
 
05:38:12.530 --> 05:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
problem they run into obviously at this
 
05:38:15.948 --> 05:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
point is that while the Renewables
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
themselves are renewable be it solar
 
05:38:19.330 --> 05:38:19.340 align:start position:0%
wind whatever
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
the battery storage that is needed to
 
05:38:25.610 --> 05:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
basically store that energy that's not
 
05:38:28.250 --> 05:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
renewable and you're basing that on
 
05:38:30.170 --> 05:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
non-renewable minerals and things like
 
05:38:33.530 --> 05:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
that so because of that the Swiss have
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
adopted a strategy going towards what
 
05:38:39.770 --> 05:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
they call a 2 000 watt Society basically
 
05:38:41.690 --> 05:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
this thing we don't think Renewables are
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to be enough we're going to have
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
to have conservation as well and so the
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
2001 they've kind of structured their
 
05:38:51.310 --> 05:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
society to incentivize
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
that use unfortunately they've been
 
05:38:56.448 --> 05:38:56.458 align:start position:0%
going after this for quite some time and
 
05:38:59.090 --> 05:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
the the energy use is actually flatlined
 
05:39:02.208 --> 05:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
it's still hanging around 6 000 watts
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact Switzerland hasn't been a 2
 
05:39:09.170 --> 05:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
000 watt Society really since the 60s so
 
05:39:11.330 --> 05:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
this has led them on to saying well how
 
05:39:12.890 --> 05:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
what are some of the other ways we could
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
look at storage and they're looking at
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogen synthetic hydrocarbons things
 
05:39:20.690 --> 05:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
of that nature but none of those are as
 
05:39:23.570 --> 05:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
efficient as the the the battery storage
 
05:39:26.890 --> 05:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
so what HB 16
 
05:39:30.890 --> 05:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
616 seems to do is basically take a more
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
alexandrian approach
 
05:39:35.208 --> 05:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
the average person in the United States
 
05:39:40.730 --> 05:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
uses 12 000 Watts not 6 000 Watts so I
 
05:39:42.288 --> 05:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
don't think really that that's a
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
long-term viable approach so another way
 
05:39:47.628 --> 05:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
that you might encourage some growth in
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
the base load is to bring on new nuclear
 
05:39:55.430 --> 05:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I think new nuclear has many
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
um attractive elements when it comes to
 
05:40:01.970 --> 05:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
providing base load power it's clean
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's also sustainable I don't think it's
 
05:40:07.490 --> 05:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
sustainable in the way of wind or
 
05:40:09.470 --> 05:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
something like that but when you compare
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
it to petroleum and other resources
 
05:40:14.570 --> 05:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
there's enough thorium on the planet to
 
05:40:17.570 --> 05:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
basically last for tens if not hundreds
 
05:40:20.208 --> 05:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
of thousands of years for so when you
 
05:40:22.610 --> 05:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
look at it relatively speaking
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it it is as far as our society is
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
concerned a de facto a sustainable
 
05:40:31.010 --> 05:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
source and there's already a commission
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
established to study new Nuclear So this
 
05:40:37.128 --> 05:40:37.138 align:start position:0%
bill might be an arrow that the
 
05:40:39.770 --> 05:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
commission may choose to to keep in its
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
quiver as it goes forward as I mentioned
 
05:40:45.530 --> 05:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
before the bill is supported by the
 
05:40:47.628 --> 05:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
department of energy as a more cost
 
05:40:51.410 --> 05:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
effective way to to promote Renewables
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
um in kind of D segments that sector and
 
05:40:57.650 --> 05:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that you will consider it I
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
think it offers a path forward to the
 
05:41:01.610 --> 05:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
expansion of those Renewables that are
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
most in in sync with New Hampshire's
 
05:41:05.448 --> 05:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
needs and I I hope you'll give it your
 
05:41:07.368 --> 05:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
full consideration and that's my
 
05:41:09.770 --> 05:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chair
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
05:41:14.448 --> 05:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation
 
05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:41:18.010 --> 05:41:18.020 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:41:23.690 --> 05:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
coming in to testify on your bill
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I think nuclear presents a sort of a
 
05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
puzzle because it is a it's a viable
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
Baseline power source for us going
 
05:41:33.240 --> 05:41:34.270 align:start position:0%
Baseline power source for us going
forward

05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:41:37.490 --> 05:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
however I questioned the
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know the placement of it in a
 
05:41:42.350 --> 05:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard because I I
 
05:41:45.050 --> 05:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
don't think it is actually renewable I
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
mean it might be a zero carbon Source
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
but um the fact that it's still
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
producing waste that was going to be
 
05:41:54.170 --> 05:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
around for hundreds thousands of years
 
05:41:57.650 --> 05:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I think invalidates its
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
category it's categorical definition as
 
05:42:01.610 --> 05:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
a renewable source and that that's
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's sort of is there a question there
 
05:42:06.890 --> 05:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sorry it's so my question is
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
how how do you how do you reconcile the
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
production of of the waste with the
 
05:42:15.050 --> 05:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
definition of renewable sources
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
05:42:18.650 --> 05:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
05:42:18.660 --> 05:42:19.550 align:start position:0%
um I think
um

05:42:19.550 --> 05:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:22.190 --> 05:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
I I look at it as renewable for a couple
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
ways um
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:42:26.160 --> 05:42:26.868 align:start position:0%
first of all
um

05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at thorium is I think the
 
05:42:32.690 --> 05:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
39th most
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
um what's the word abundant mineral on
 
05:42:37.610 --> 05:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
the earth so I think there there's lots
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
of thorium and in terms of uh the waste
 
05:42:45.708 --> 05:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
disposal uh I think that there are
 
05:42:50.090 --> 05:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
the the problem with disposal is and I'm
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not a nuclear scientist okay so I I
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
hope you take uh my answer in the spirit
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
that is offered but I think that the
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
challenges with disposal of nuclear are
 
05:43:04.610 --> 05:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
are more political uh that than they are
 
05:43:06.650 --> 05:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
technical I think you know there has
 
05:43:08.570 --> 05:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
been talk in the past of storage with
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
with uh Yucca Mountain you could store
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the waste in kind of a titanium Matrix
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
which would basically preserve it and
 
05:43:20.208 --> 05:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
not allow it to get into water or things
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
like that and ultimately
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
um if you look at uh the half-life
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that's very radioactive also
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
has a very short half-life so I think
 
05:43:34.850 --> 05:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the waste disposal issues
 
05:43:36.530 --> 05:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
are technical
 
05:43:40.250 --> 05:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
um but also if you look at when you're
 
05:43:42.288 --> 05:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
looking at something like for example if
 
05:43:46.368 --> 05:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
I wanted to use a base load uh and I'm
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
using Battery Technology to store it we
 
05:43:51.230 --> 05:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
also I think have
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
um a lot of technical issues with
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
respect to what do we do with the the
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
left over batteries right so those are
 
05:44:03.288 --> 05:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
those are technical uh problems as well
 
05:44:06.530 --> 05:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
which I I think we we could address
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um but I I think from the terms of is it
 
05:44:12.590 --> 05:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
sustainable I think the disposal issues
 
05:44:14.570 --> 05:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
can be addressed I'm just looking at it
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
as as a fuel source is it something that
 
05:44:20.330 --> 05:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
as an end lifers we can see well into
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
the future so that's why that's why I'm
 
05:44:28.490 --> 05:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
05:44:33.410 --> 05:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman thank you
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative for over here coming in
 
05:44:36.480 --> 05:44:40.490 align:start position:0%
representative for over here coming in
um

05:44:40.490 --> 05:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:42.410 --> 05:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know exactly what you're
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
referring to as new nuclear but when I
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
hear people talking about the next
 
05:44:48.650 --> 05:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
generation of nuclear
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
um generation I I I I also hear them
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
talk in terms of like 20 30 40 years
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
from now
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and if that's what you're talking
 
05:45:00.770 --> 05:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
about that's not really going to help us
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.260 --> 05:45:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:45:04.850 --> 05:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think the fact that we have a
 
05:45:11.330 --> 05:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
commission specifically set up to study
 
05:45:14.270 --> 05:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
how to bring new nuclear to the state
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
is an indication of the fact that um
 
05:45:21.048 --> 05:45:21.058 align:start position:0%
we're much closer than 30 or 40 years I
 
05:45:22.970 --> 05:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
think that there are and again I'm not a
 
05:45:24.530 --> 05:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
nuclear engineer and so I want to
 
05:45:27.650 --> 05:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
qualify my answer but I think
 
05:45:27.660 --> 05:45:28.628 align:start position:0%
qualify my answer but I think
um

05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
these are using a more abundant source
 
05:45:35.330 --> 05:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
and again I think the the largest issue
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to these reactors has just
 
05:45:37.680 --> 05:45:38.750 align:start position:0%
with respect to these reactors has just
been

05:45:38.750 --> 05:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:45:40.128 --> 05:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
um the fact that if you're using for
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
example a molten salt a molten salt is
 
05:45:44.570 --> 05:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
going to be highly corrosive and so you
 
05:45:46.670 --> 05:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
have to develop Alloys and things that
 
05:45:48.470 --> 05:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to to protect the
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
reactor vessel itself and I think
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of research that's
 
05:45:54.470 --> 05:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
been done removing oxygen from the
 
05:45:56.930 --> 05:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
reactor working on the Alloys
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and so but again I'm not a nuclear
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
engineer and so I don't know all of the
 
05:46:04.010 --> 05:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
answers to that but I think the fact
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
that we have a commission and they are
 
05:46:09.470 --> 05:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
actively studying this shows that this
 
05:46:11.208 --> 05:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
is something that's not 30 or 40 years
 
05:46:11.218 --> 05:46:12.650 align:start position:0%
is something that's not 30 or 40 years
out

05:46:12.650 --> 05:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:46:14.570 --> 05:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
05:46:18.110 --> 05:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas said his thank you Mr chair
 
05:46:20.090 --> 05:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question so
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh to piggyback on uh representative
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
Muntz question
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
um are when you talk about nuclear are
 
05:46:30.350 --> 05:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
are you referring to what we call
 
05:46:33.170 --> 05:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
small-scale nuclear that is not only
 
05:46:35.690 --> 05:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
five or ten years potentially in the
 
05:46:38.330 --> 05:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
future but we also have some pilot
 
05:46:40.970 --> 05:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
programs going on in this country as it
 
05:46:42.830 --> 05:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
is now is that what you're referring to
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about nuclear class
 
05:46:44.638 --> 05:46:45.590 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about nuclear class
five

05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:46:48.410 --> 05:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
yes the the bill is speaking to Gen 4
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
and later nuclear so obviously it
 
05:46:52.610 --> 05:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a Seabrook it would be just
 
05:46:53.868 --> 05:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about yes that's
 
05:46:53.878 --> 05:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about yes that's
correct

05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:47:01.490 --> 05:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
um if I read this bill correctly on page
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
two you're removing all funds that um
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
are used by the doe to support thermal
 
05:47:13.128 --> 05:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
and electrical so basically
 
05:47:15.530 --> 05:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm using my words carefully here
 
05:47:18.890 --> 05:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
you want to Nuke all Renewables in New
 
05:47:21.288 --> 05:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a pretty drastic
 
05:47:24.110 --> 05:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
proposal so my question to you is I'd
 
05:47:25.850 --> 05:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
like to know with whom did you consult
 
05:47:29.930 --> 05:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:29.940 --> 05:47:30.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:34.610 --> 05:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
I consulted with with OLS primarily but
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
I don't the
 
05:47:36.360 --> 05:47:38.030 align:start position:0%
I don't the
the

05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:47:40.430 --> 05:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
renewable the alternate compliance
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
payments they still go into the um
 
05:47:45.708 --> 05:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
what's it called
 
05:47:49.128 --> 05:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
they still go into the um
 
05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
renewable renewable energy fund which is
 
05:47:53.990 --> 05:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
a non-lapsing fund so I think that money
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:00.530 --> 05:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:48:02.570 --> 05:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
um but yet that part is stricken out on
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.160 --> 05:48:08.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
out because everything is going to a
 
05:48:14.470 --> 05:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
standard uh fee of
 
05:48:17.208 --> 05:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
55 dollars
 
05:48:17.218 --> 05:48:18.190 align:start position:0%
55 dollars
um

05:48:18.190 --> 05:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
55 across the board to be deposited into
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
that fund per each megawatt hour not met
 
05:48:27.650 --> 05:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
by the uh
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
just one more so representative I think
 
05:48:37.610 --> 05:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question correctly
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
you're assuming that this language
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
completely removes
 
05:48:46.970 --> 05:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
renewable energy incentives
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
but that's not the case what this
 
05:48:51.890 --> 05:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
legislation does is it eliminates the
 
05:48:53.570 --> 05:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
different classes
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
puts all Renewables in one class where
 
05:49:00.410 --> 05:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
they compete against each other
 
05:49:03.350 --> 05:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the sale of wrecks including the
 
05:49:05.650 --> 05:49:05.660 align:start position:0%
addition of this new class five
 
05:49:07.970 --> 05:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that that clarifies it yeah the
 
05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
source of your confusion thank you thank
 
05:49:11.458 --> 05:49:12.288 align:start position:0%
source of your confusion thank you thank
you

05:49:12.288 --> 05:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
05:49:15.890 --> 05:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:49:20.208 --> 05:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
um speaking on small-scale nuclear
 
05:49:22.010 --> 05:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
um which is I know being tested
 
05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
currently by the U.S Navy for production
 
05:49:26.868 --> 05:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
of submarines and and future and
 
05:49:29.208 --> 05:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
aircraft carriers is it not true that
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
there is no waste from small-scale
 
05:49:36.350 --> 05:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't
 
05:49:41.330 --> 05:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not a nuclear engineer as I said but
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
I think that there is still some waste I
 
05:49:47.090 --> 05:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
think they're very efficient because of
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
the way the moderator is structured but
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there is no waste I
 
05:49:52.690 --> 05:49:52.700 align:start position:0%
do know
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
that you can use spent fuel depending
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
upon how the reactor is configured you
 
05:50:03.970 --> 05:50:03.980 align:start position:0%
can use spent fuel say from Seabrook as
 
05:50:09.770 --> 05:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:11.628 --> 05:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has another
 
05:50:11.638 --> 05:50:13.490 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has another
question

05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:50:16.010 --> 05:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
yeah it's similar to my first question
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the nuclear fitting into
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
um you know from the way there is a
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
question here so just bear with me but
 
05:50:26.208 --> 05:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
the way I see it the Renewables all have
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh lots of things in common besides
 
05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
they're being renewable that and the
 
05:50:31.610 --> 05:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
fact that they're intermittent the fact
 
05:50:33.070 --> 05:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
that they're distributed
 
05:50:35.330 --> 05:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
this the nuclear even though they're
 
05:50:35.340 --> 05:50:36.288 align:start position:0%
this the nuclear even though they're
small

05:50:36.288 --> 05:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:50:36.298 --> 05:50:36.890 align:start position:0%
small
um

05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
they really fit more on the model of you
 
05:50:41.570 --> 05:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
know the traditional electrical
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
generation power stations centrally
 
05:50:45.410 --> 05:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
located you know
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't the placement of these new
 
05:50:49.200 --> 05:50:50.270 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't the placement of these new
nuclear

05:50:50.270 --> 05:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
um generate generating uh sources
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
distort the renewable portfolio standard
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
and miss and displace to a certain
 
05:50:59.448 --> 05:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
extent that the quote unquote
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.570 --> 05:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:51:09.230 --> 05:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
as you go forward if you want to reduce
 
05:51:12.288 --> 05:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
your carbon emissions then you're going
 
05:51:14.690 --> 05:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
to have to have some kind of
 
05:51:17.770 --> 05:51:17.780 align:start position:0%
base load element
 
05:51:21.948 --> 05:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
and I think that this
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
will work in tandem with those other
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
forms of Renewables and so I actually
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
believe it is well placed
 
05:51:31.788 --> 05:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
on representative kaplan's question
 
05:51:36.890 --> 05:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes of the renewable
 
05:51:39.890 --> 05:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard is to incentivize the
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
development of new generation sources
 
05:51:46.610 --> 05:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
by putting nuclear small-scale nuclear
 
05:51:49.250 --> 05:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
into the RPS
 
05:51:52.930 --> 05:51:52.940 align:start position:0%
you'd be adding an incentive to generate
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
to to create new sources of of
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
electricity so doesn't that make it
 
05:52:02.090 --> 05:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
logical as a place to put
 
05:52:05.770 --> 05:52:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:09.110 --> 05:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
that was that was absolutely my thinking
 
05:52:12.530 --> 05:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't think if I look at the
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
example of the Swiss
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:52:18.650 --> 05:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
rely on conservation to reduce your base
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
load is just this is
 
05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to find a way to
 
05:52:28.610 --> 05:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
incentivize new technologies that
 
05:52:30.530 --> 05:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
provide base load to complement your
 
05:52:33.530 --> 05:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
other Renewables and this is a
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
sustainable clean source that allows you
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
to do that and so the intention is to
 
05:52:42.590 --> 05:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.410 --> 05:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds uh you're the
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill so
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
no no you're not sorry
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Reynolds is
 
05:52:52.320 --> 05:52:53.390 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Reynolds is
recognized

05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:52:55.128 --> 05:52:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:52:57.948 --> 05:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
um I have a good question that's a
 
05:52:59.810 --> 05:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up on actually representative
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
Muntz question but before I ask it I I
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
just want to assure representative
 
05:53:06.170 --> 05:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
Summers and everyone else that I I live
 
05:53:08.030 --> 05:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
across the river from the Portsmouth
 
05:53:09.770 --> 05:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard where of course they
 
05:53:11.448 --> 05:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
bring in nuclear submarines and repair
 
05:53:14.270 --> 05:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
them and I assure you that the
 
05:53:16.610 --> 05:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
reactors on those subs do have nuclear
 
05:53:19.610 --> 05:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
waste which they take off of the subs
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
and remove
 
05:53:22.670 --> 05:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
be a train in the middle of the night
 
05:53:24.410 --> 05:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
and the Navy doesn't like to talk about
 
05:53:26.448 --> 05:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
it and as local politicians we're not
 
05:53:27.890 --> 05:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
supposed to talk about it but there's
 
05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly waste and believe me I'm
 
05:53:33.170 --> 05:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
excited for the day that that technology
 
05:53:35.570 --> 05:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
could be modularized and there could be
 
05:53:39.530 --> 05:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
small nuclear reactors let's get back to
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
the bill please so the question is
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
following up representative munzel's
 
05:53:45.410 --> 05:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
rather general what
 
05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
can you give us sort of a a year that
 
05:53:51.770 --> 05:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
you think uh what is the day the date on
 
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
which a one of these new modular
 
05:53:57.530 --> 05:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
reactors might bid its capacity into the
 
05:54:00.650 --> 05:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market or bid its
 
05:54:04.010 --> 05:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
output to the uh provide the energy to a
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
community power plan what what year are
 
05:54:09.590 --> 05:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
we talking 2030 are we talking 20
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
35 or 2040 based on your
 
05:54:16.610 --> 05:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
whatever you've read or studied
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
what year I mean I'm I'm just going to
 
05:54:22.490 --> 05:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
go I I I think you're looking within the
 
05:54:22.500 --> 05:54:24.230 align:start position:0%
go I I I think you're looking within the
decade

05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
decade
 
05:54:26.690 --> 05:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
we're in 2030.
 
05:54:29.448 --> 05:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
within the decade so you know five ten
 
05:54:31.070 --> 05:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
years I think you're looking within a
 
05:54:34.368 --> 05:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
decade but I'm not a subject expert so I
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
don't think I can get more specific than
 
05:54:35.940 --> 05:54:38.690 align:start position:0%
don't think I can get more specific than
that

05:54:38.690 --> 05:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:41.750 --> 05:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
the NRC has licensed
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh new scale small-scale reactors
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
already so it's just a matter of
 
05:54:51.230 --> 05:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative partial appears to have a
 
05:54:53.520 --> 05:54:55.368 align:start position:0%
representative partial appears to have a
question

05:54:55.368 --> 05:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:54:57.970 --> 05:54:57.980 align:start position:0%
yes uh knowing that there are two
 
05:55:00.490 --> 05:55:00.500 align:start position:0%
experimental uh
 
05:55:02.750 --> 05:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
stations in existence now
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I'd like to see more
 
05:55:06.110 --> 05:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
than see these
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that's a two-part question actually
 
05:55:10.730 --> 05:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
but see these uh incentivized but do you
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
feel that perhaps it may be too soon to
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
have this written in a law when there's
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
not one commercially viable station out
 
05:55:18.000 --> 05:55:22.250 align:start position:0%
not one commercially viable station out
there

05:55:22.250 --> 05:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:26.030 --> 05:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
this is a very promising technology
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
and I think that I would like to see New
 
05:55:33.410 --> 05:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the front end of that
 
05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
technology rather on than on the back
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
end of that technology I would I think
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we could potentially if there's an
 
05:55:41.690 --> 05:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to be a leader in
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
this area why not go for it and I think
 
05:55:46.850 --> 05:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
this would incentivize that
 
05:55:46.860 --> 05:55:48.048 align:start position:0%
this would incentivize that
follow-up

05:55:48.048 --> 05:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
and do you feel that market forces being
 
05:55:52.970 --> 05:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
what they are if this is so is promising
 
05:55:55.610 --> 05:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
as we all hope it actually is do you
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
feel that they need this type of
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
incentive to move it forward or will
 
05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
Market forces a free market
 
05:56:01.320 --> 05:56:02.270 align:start position:0%
Market forces a free market
um

05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
instead of as act as incentive enough to
 
05:56:07.490 --> 05:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
produce these types of plants
 
05:56:10.490 --> 05:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
I think that there's it's a new
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
technology and
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
um as with all nuclear there's going to
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
be Capital costs and
 
05:56:19.730 --> 05:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
um so I think when you're bringing in a
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
new technology uh this is this is a
 
05:56:24.288 --> 05:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
great way to incentivize it it's not
 
05:56:26.810 --> 05:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
like this is something that is an
 
05:56:29.810 --> 05:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
already existing technology where I
 
05:56:32.510 --> 05:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
could just go and you know let the
 
05:56:35.570 --> 05:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
market forces come in the renewable
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard was in fact set up
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that some of these other
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
Technologies needed room to come in and
 
05:56:47.448 --> 05:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
kind of have a run path to build
 
05:56:49.128 --> 05:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
themselves up
 
05:56:50.930 --> 05:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
you know I know what's the third
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
question may I representative munz has a
 
05:56:53.280 --> 05:56:54.590 align:start position:0%
question may I representative munz has a
question

05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:56:56.448 --> 05:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure I'm clear
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
um the the new class of nuclear class
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
five is it that we're talking about
 
05:57:08.890 --> 05:57:08.900 align:start position:0%
um that would be included in the overall
 
05:57:12.708 --> 05:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard right so in
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
2025 the standard would be 25.2 percent
 
05:57:20.208 --> 05:57:20.218 align:start position:0%
that would include nuclear as well yes
 
05:57:21.770 --> 05:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
that that would include that as well
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:28.310 --> 05:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for the
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor I want to thank
 
05:57:31.970 --> 05:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative McLean for introducing
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation we have
 
05:57:35.448 --> 05:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
three more people who would like to
 
05:57:38.810 --> 05:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill between now and 3
 
05:57:38.820 --> 05:57:39.890 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill between now and 3
30.

05:57:39.890 --> 05:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
30.
 
05:57:39.900 --> 05:57:41.628 align:start position:0%
30.
so

05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're actually between now and three
 
05:57:46.368 --> 05:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
o'clock which is three minutes so I'll
 
05:57:48.410 --> 05:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
call on Heidi Kroll from the granite
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.090 --> 05:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
and welcome back to sdne Ms Crowell nice
 
05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee I will be brief recognizing
 
05:58:02.570 --> 05:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:58:04.368 --> 05:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
um my name is Heidi Kroll I work at
 
05:58:06.890 --> 05:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Callahan and gartrell and I'm
 
05:58:08.448 --> 05:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
here today representing the granite
 
05:58:11.770 --> 05:58:11.780 align:start position:0%
state hydropower Association which is a
 
05:58:14.330 --> 05:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
voluntary Association of New Hampshire's
 
05:58:16.368 --> 05:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
very small scale Hydro facilities of
 
05:58:19.788 --> 05:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
five megawatts or less we have about 55
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts in total across the membership
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
in about 35 or so cities and towns
 
05:58:27.770 --> 05:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we are strongly
 
05:58:30.910 --> 05:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill
 
05:58:34.368 --> 05:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
616 and we would encourage this
 
05:58:36.048 --> 05:58:36.058 align:start position:0%
committee to find it in expedient to
 
05:58:36.058 --> 05:58:37.548 align:start position:0%
committee to find it in expedient to
legislate

05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:58:37.558 --> 05:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
legislate
um

05:58:39.190 --> 05:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware there is no other
 
05:58:41.820 --> 05:58:43.310 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware there is no other
RPS

05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
05:58:45.230 --> 05:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
um program certainly in New England
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire is part of the New
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
England Market that um has eliminated
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
all of its classes and added nuclear to
 
05:58:58.490 --> 05:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
the um to the program uh so our feeling
 
05:58:59.810 --> 05:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
is that this would represent a
 
05:59:01.490 --> 05:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
significant departure from the purpose
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire RPS law which is to
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
support diverse locally distributed
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
small-scale existing and new Renewables
 
05:59:10.558 --> 05:59:11.208 align:start position:0%
small-scale existing and new Renewables
um

05:59:11.208 --> 05:59:11.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
and uh if we were to allow nuclear in
 
05:59:16.910 --> 05:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
our concern is among many others is that
 
05:59:19.490 --> 05:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
this would essentially swamp much of the
 
05:59:22.190 --> 05:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
RPS program which would in turn
 
05:59:23.810 --> 05:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
um cause a lot of harm for New
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's in-state small-scale uh
 
05:59:28.970 --> 05:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
existing and potentially new Renewables
 
05:59:30.890 --> 05:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
coming down the road
 
05:59:33.470 --> 05:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
um our current law was carefully
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
designed to ensure that we promote and
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from a diverse portfolio of
 
05:59:39.410 --> 05:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
renewable facilities in terms of their
 
05:59:41.690 --> 05:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
fuel source their technology their age
 
05:59:44.750 --> 05:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
and their size and that's how the four
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
classes came about I was actually around
 
05:59:51.410 --> 05:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
during the years leading up to all the
 
05:59:53.170 --> 05:59:53.180 align:start position:0%
work that went into
 
05:59:55.368 --> 05:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
crafting the RPS there were several
 
05:59:59.330 --> 05:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
years of of very careful study with this
 
06:00:00.948 --> 06:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
committee and its counterpart in the
 
06:00:03.650 --> 06:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
Senate and I did go back and pull the
 
06:00:07.368 --> 06:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
original bill which created the RPS law
 
06:00:08.770 --> 06:00:08.780 align:start position:0%
this was
 
06:00:12.410 --> 06:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
passed in 2007 if I'm remembering
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
correctly and I just wanted to read this
 
06:00:15.708 --> 06:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
piece here
 
06:00:15.718 --> 06:00:16.448 align:start position:0%
piece here
um

06:00:16.448 --> 06:00:16.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:19.368 --> 06:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
uh one principle one guiding principle
 
06:00:21.890 --> 06:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
that was used that was coming out of the
 
06:00:24.770 --> 06:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
state energy policy commission which had
 
06:00:27.530 --> 06:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
been established in 2006
 
06:00:29.868 --> 06:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
um one principle is and this was in the
 
06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the findings that uh
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
led up to they're not you won't find
 
06:00:36.590 --> 06:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
them in the statutes but they're in the
 
06:00:39.110 --> 06:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill it says one principle is to
 
06:00:41.510 --> 06:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
increase the state's fuel diversity by
 
06:00:43.310 --> 06:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
reducing the fossil fuel component of
 
06:00:45.410 --> 06:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
the state's Energy Mix and promoting use
 
06:00:47.930 --> 06:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy resources to buffer
 
06:00:50.810 --> 06:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
against Global instability and I think
 
06:00:50.820 --> 06:00:51.770 align:start position:0%
against Global instability and I think
that's

06:00:51.770 --> 06:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
seems to really still hold true today
 
06:00:56.690 --> 06:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
two other points I'll quickly make
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
before I wrap it up
 
06:00:58.798 --> 06:01:00.650 align:start position:0%
before I wrap it up
uh

06:01:00.650 --> 06:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
investors in renewable small-scale
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
renewable facilities here in New
 
06:01:06.650 --> 06:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire look for stability in terms of
 
06:01:08.948 --> 06:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
policy they're making long-term
 
06:01:11.208 --> 06:01:11.218 align:start position:0%
Investments whether it's reinvestment in
 
06:01:13.490 --> 06:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
existing facilities or its investment in
 
06:01:16.330 --> 06:01:16.340 align:start position:0%
new facilities so the stability of
 
06:01:20.930 --> 06:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
policies expectations is very important
 
06:01:20.940 --> 06:01:22.250 align:start position:0%
policies expectations is very important
um

06:01:22.250 --> 06:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:24.288 --> 06:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
and I guess yeah stability and policy
 
06:01:27.288 --> 06:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
consistency so with that I'm happy to
 
06:01:28.850 --> 06:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
06:01:28.860 --> 06:01:29.628 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
um

06:01:29.628 --> 06:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you nice job two minutes and 45
 
06:01:34.680 --> 06:01:36.830 align:start position:0%
thank you nice job two minutes and 45
seconds

06:01:36.830 --> 06:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Corman has a question
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:01:45.170 --> 06:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you said that
 
06:01:47.810 --> 06:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
you're concerned that allowing nuclear
 
06:01:51.650 --> 06:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
into the RPS standards would swamp much
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the program do you have any estimate
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
for how much of the RPS would be
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
satisfied by a nuclear compared with all
 
06:02:01.970 --> 06:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
the other classes that we currently have
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean listening to the
 
06:02:06.650 --> 06:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like it's it's new
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
small-scale nuclear which is not even
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
kind of commercially available right now
 
06:02:13.070 --> 06:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously if it was something like
 
06:02:14.810 --> 06:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
Seabrook station
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
um that would just you know
 
06:02:22.010 --> 06:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
multiple folds I think um swamp with the
 
06:02:25.070 --> 06:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh amount of kilowatt
 
06:02:26.690 --> 06:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
hours that's required currently under
 
06:02:31.850 --> 06:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:33.890 --> 06:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
06:02:38.510 --> 06:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you mentioned
 
06:02:41.570 --> 06:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
back in 2007 and that was a time period
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
I believe uh where no one even ever
 
06:02:48.048 --> 06:02:48.058 align:start position:0%
considered that they would ever ever be
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear in this state again because of
 
06:02:52.548 --> 06:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and so forth but here we come
 
06:02:56.530 --> 06:02:56.540 align:start position:0%
along with some new technology would
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
what would be your rationale uh on on
 
06:03:03.770 --> 06:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
this bill uh to that that would prevent
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
new technology that would come in that
 
06:03:08.090 --> 06:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
might even be more efficient than what
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have now in the in the interest of
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
progress uh do you think we could all
 
06:03:14.810 --> 06:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
live together with that
 
06:03:17.330 --> 06:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'm all for progress and and certainly
 
06:03:19.368 --> 06:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
if it's clean technology
 
06:03:22.070 --> 06:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
06:03:24.530 --> 06:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
um that makes a lot of sense I'm just
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
um our position simply is that putting
 
06:03:29.330 --> 06:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
it into the RPS statute is probably the
 
06:03:34.250 --> 06:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you Miss
 
06:03:42.170 --> 06:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
Crow for giving us your perspective on
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation proposed legislation
 
06:03:46.490 --> 06:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Now call on
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield from The Nature
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
Conservancy to give us her take on this
 
06:03:51.240 --> 06:03:53.448 align:start position:0%
Conservancy to give us her take on this
bill

06:03:53.448 --> 06:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:03:55.368 --> 06:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss afternoon
 
06:03:58.610 --> 06:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you I um
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield for The Nature
 
06:04:02.690 --> 06:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
Conservancy I agree with everything that
 
06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
miss Kroll said and I think she said it
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
better than I could have so I won't be
 
06:04:09.410 --> 06:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
repetitive but um I also had the
 
06:04:12.048 --> 06:04:12.058 align:start position:0%
privilege of participating in the
 
06:04:14.690 --> 06:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
development of the RPS back in 2006
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
including a very extensive stakeholder
 
06:04:20.330 --> 06:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
process that Des LED that brought all of
 
06:04:22.490 --> 06:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
the interest together to develop our RPS
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
so I would urge the committee to find
 
06:04:27.470 --> 06:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate and
 
06:04:30.170 --> 06:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
instead urge you to consider these
 
06:04:32.410 --> 06:04:32.420 align:start position:0%
issues perhaps in another setting
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps There's an opportunity to study
 
06:04:38.270 --> 06:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
this issue and consider if the state
 
06:04:41.390 --> 06:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
wishes to incentivize Technologies other
 
06:04:43.730 --> 06:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
than Renewables because nuclear energy
 
06:04:46.490 --> 06:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
respect with all due respect is not
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
renewable you could consider looking at
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing in in this
 
06:04:53.330 --> 06:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
Arena creating mechanisms like a clean
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
energy standard and you would decide
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
what qualifies for clean so some states
 
06:05:02.628 --> 06:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
are running the RPS and the CES in
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
parallel and I would also urge caution
 
06:05:09.530 --> 06:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
since last year in House Bill 543 you
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
created the commission to investigate
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
the implementation of Next Generation
 
06:05:16.910 --> 06:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology in New
 
06:05:16.920 --> 06:05:17.890 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology in New
Hampshire

06:05:17.890 --> 06:05:17.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington is the
 
06:05:22.610 --> 06:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
vice chair of that committee so it's too
 
06:05:24.350 --> 06:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
bad he's not here with his background in
 
06:05:28.190 --> 06:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear issues but that body has been
 
06:05:30.288 --> 06:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
meeting and if you look at their
 
06:05:35.090 --> 06:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
December 1st 2022 report they said that
 
06:05:37.250 --> 06:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
they're still in the investigatory
 
06:05:39.650 --> 06:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
phases exploring the issues and that
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
they do intend to make recommendations
 
06:05:45.048 --> 06:05:45.058 align:start position:0%
potentially for legislation but also for
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
other actions that the state could take
 
06:05:48.650 --> 06:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
so that we are ready when this
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.000 --> 06:06:04.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:06:04.270 --> 06:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:06:09.170 --> 06:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
coming back as as someone that was
 
06:06:11.690 --> 06:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
involved in the development of the um
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
the the renewable portfolio standards
 
06:06:15.120 --> 06:06:16.128 align:start position:0%
the the renewable portfolio standards
um

06:06:16.128 --> 06:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
is there a place in those standards for
 
06:06:21.288 --> 06:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
encouraging the development of of
 
06:06:21.298 --> 06:06:22.490 align:start position:0%
encouraging the development of of
storage

06:06:22.490 --> 06:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
storage
 
06:06:25.150 --> 06:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm reading a lot about
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
alternative batteries I mean Iron air
 
06:06:30.530 --> 06:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
batteries for example uh and we've heard
 
06:06:33.770 --> 06:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony today on you know the
 
06:06:35.930 --> 06:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
challenges that lack of battery capacity
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
has and it its impact on encouraging
 
06:06:41.270 --> 06:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
development but is that something that
 
06:06:42.650 --> 06:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:06:44.810 --> 06:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
that where the that could be addressed
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
through the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um and I
 
06:06:51.708 --> 06:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
should say an apologies to the chair
 
06:06:53.090 --> 06:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
because I know this is a little off
 
06:06:53.100 --> 06:06:54.830 align:start position:0%
because I know this is a little off
topic

06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
topic
 
06:06:58.310 --> 06:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
I as has been testified
 
06:07:01.490 --> 06:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
um by many experts before you storage
 
06:07:05.208 --> 06:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
really is going to be a game changer and
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
it it's already being deployed today as
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know but um it really will help make
 
06:07:14.090 --> 06:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
intermittent resources available to us
 
06:07:16.910 --> 06:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
at more times of the day and I would
 
06:07:16.920 --> 06:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
at more times of the day and I would
note

06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
note
 
06:07:20.690 --> 06:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
um that we do have programs in New
 
06:07:22.368 --> 06:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help try to incentivize
 
06:07:23.810 --> 06:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
storage but they are quite small
 
06:07:26.330 --> 06:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
compared with other states and other
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
states are doing pilot programs right
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
now to test the cost effectiveness of
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
storage and it is pretty exciting
 
06:07:34.970 --> 06:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
because even for buildings that don't
 
06:07:37.850 --> 06:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
have their own distributed generation so
 
06:07:40.910 --> 06:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
for example solar some storage programs
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
are showing cost Effectiveness even when
 
06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
you are charging batteries from the grid
 
06:07:49.490 --> 06:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
and they also provide tremendous
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
resilience benefits when the power does
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
go out so they do have a lot of
 
06:07:56.448 --> 06:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
potential applications and and I think
 
06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
that they do make sense when we're
 
06:08:04.970 --> 06:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:06.470 --> 06:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
06:08:08.990 --> 06:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'll thank you for being with us this
 
06:08:10.610 --> 06:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you look forward to
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
seeing you in the future
 
06:08:16.010 --> 06:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
the last pink card I have for today
 
06:08:18.470 --> 06:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
will bring forward Mr John Gage
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
representing himself and Mr Gage has
 
06:08:24.890 --> 06:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
requested three minutes so Mr Gage we
 
06:08:31.990 --> 06:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:35.690 --> 06:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and committee members
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to keep it to one because
 
06:08:38.690 --> 06:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
most of what I wanted to say was just
 
06:08:41.570 --> 06:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
said by the last two people
 
06:08:41.580 --> 06:08:42.770 align:start position:0%
said by the last two people
um

06:08:42.770 --> 06:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
you know one of the major things you can
 
06:08:48.890 --> 06:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
do as a a committee that helps energy in
 
06:08:51.770 --> 06:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
our state is provide stability in the
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
market uh conditions that that energy
 
06:08:57.650 --> 06:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
providers use to make decisions and uh
 
06:09:00.368 --> 06:09:00.378 align:start position:0%
it sounds like adding nuclear to the RPS
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio mix will destabilize a lot of
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
current policy that energy providers are
 
06:09:09.670 --> 06:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
using right now to make plans
 
06:09:12.110 --> 06:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear is not a solution in the short
 
06:09:15.770 --> 06:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
term for climate pollution in the next
 
06:09:18.610 --> 06:09:18.620 align:start position:0%
10 years our country's committed to 50
 
06:09:20.930 --> 06:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
 
06:09:23.810 --> 06:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
and it takes a long time to to roll out
 
06:09:26.810 --> 06:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
a nuclear plant to do that we need
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
solar and wind and storage rolling out
 
06:09:34.368 --> 06:09:34.378 align:start position:0%
is you know rapidly as as we can the
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
reason that would be good for our state
 
06:09:40.250 --> 06:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't change the RPS rules
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
right now we we should be encouraging
 
06:09:45.048 --> 06:09:45.058 align:start position:0%
more of those not destabilizing
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
um those providers carbon pricing is
 
06:09:50.570 --> 06:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
inevitable it's in 68 countries and
 
06:09:52.490 --> 06:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
regions around the world
 
06:09:55.610 --> 06:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
um prices are rising the EU is about to
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
start charging our exporters their
 
06:10:00.170 --> 06:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
carbon price on high energy intensive
 
06:10:02.750 --> 06:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
Goods the writing is on the wall the
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to price
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
carbon soon
 
06:10:07.750 --> 06:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
we should be doing what we can
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
to prepare for that
 
06:10:13.490 --> 06:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
um nuclear is a great option but it's
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
not going to help us in the short term
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
reducing emissions I do agree we need
 
06:10:19.310 --> 06:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
firm power we're going to need 15 or 20
 
06:10:22.128 --> 06:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
percent of nuclear power in the long
 
06:10:24.590 --> 06:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
term so we should look to how to
 
06:10:26.510 --> 06:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
incentivize that but please don't
 
06:10:29.708 --> 06:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
destabilize the short-term renewable
 
06:10:31.788 --> 06:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
policies that we've got in place right
 
06:10:31.798 --> 06:10:32.628 align:start position:0%
policies that we've got in place right
now

06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:10:35.448 --> 06:10:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
well done
 
06:10:40.610 --> 06:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
two minutes four seconds
 
06:10:44.208 --> 06:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh questions for uh Mr
 
06:10:47.090 --> 06:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
Gage representative cornman
 
06:10:49.610 --> 06:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr Gage
 
06:10:52.910 --> 06:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh you said that you you think that we
 
06:10:56.030 --> 06:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
should not be changing the RPS does that
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
mean that you feel like the current
 
06:10:59.448 --> 06:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
percentages that we have for the classes
 
06:11:01.850 --> 06:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
in the RPS should not change no I'm
 
06:11:04.490 --> 06:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
sorry uh as pertains to this bill they
 
06:11:07.490 --> 06:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
should not change I was at a hearing in
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate energy environment where
 
06:11:12.288 --> 06:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
somebody suggested greatly increasing
 
06:11:15.590 --> 06:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements for uh solar generation
 
06:11:17.330 --> 06:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the direction we
 
06:11:18.770 --> 06:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
should be going
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't I didn't want it watered down
 
06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
by adding nuclear which would would
 
06:11:26.030 --> 06:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
basically swamp the the Renewables that
 
06:11:28.610 --> 06:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
are being supported right now
 
06:11:31.610 --> 06:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
we should be doing more
 
06:11:34.610 --> 06:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative pleasure has a question
 
06:11:38.690 --> 06:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh thank you Mr Gage uh
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
 
06:11:43.128 --> 06:11:43.138 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
we should be looking and probably
 
06:11:49.250 --> 06:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
incentivizing the new generation nukes
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
but not
 
06:11:53.330 --> 06:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
06:11:55.368 --> 06:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
yes I think nuclear is an important
 
06:11:57.288 --> 06:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
long-term solution
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
um Seabrook isn't going to last forever
 
06:12:02.208 --> 06:12:02.218 align:start position:0%
we should be looking forward to how
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be replacing that
 
06:12:07.490 --> 06:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the the bow cold plant is going to go
 
06:12:10.010 --> 06:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
away that would be a good place to put a
 
06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh a small modular reactor
 
06:12:14.270 --> 06:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we should be looking at these things
 
06:12:16.490 --> 06:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
but we should not destabilize the
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
deployments of solar and wind that we
 
06:12:19.788 --> 06:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
have going right now we should be
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
increasing those giving the market
 
06:12:24.170 --> 06:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
stability to to ramp those up and doing
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we
 
06:12:32.930 --> 06:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today and
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
giving us your perspective on this
 
06:12:36.470 --> 06:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
06:12:38.570 --> 06:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no more pink cards on this bill
 
06:12:40.910 --> 06:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
06:12:44.330 --> 06:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 616.
 
06:12:46.850 --> 06:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
and thank representative McLean for
 
06:12:50.330 --> 06:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
and now I will open a public hearing on
 
06:12:55.970 --> 06:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
House Bill 622
 
06:12:58.128 --> 06:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
which is an act that
 
06:12:58.138 --> 06:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
which is an act that
repeals

06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
06:13:01.970 --> 06:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency and sustainable
 
06:13:03.288 --> 06:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
energy board
 
06:13:06.048 --> 06:13:06.058 align:start position:0%
and call on the bills Prime sponsor
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative J.D Bernardi to introduce
 
06:13:11.810 --> 06:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
06:13:14.510 --> 06:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
and remind everyone that we need pink
 
06:13:19.270 --> 06:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
cards if you have an an intention to
 
06:13:24.170 --> 06:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:27.350 --> 06:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have a question
 
06:13:28.970 --> 06:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Summers what's your
 
06:13:30.410 --> 06:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
question just to verify from this
 
06:13:32.690 --> 06:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
morning I know I'm a co-sponsor on this
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
so as long as I don't testify I'm
 
06:13:36.410 --> 06:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask questions correct that is
 
06:14:35.930 --> 06:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi it's all yours
 
06:14:42.170 --> 06:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'm
 
06:14:45.170 --> 06:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative JD Bernardi Rockingham 36
 
06:14:47.150 --> 06:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
which is Hampton Falls
 
06:14:49.250 --> 06:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
Kensington Southampton Newton and
 
06:14:49.260 --> 06:14:50.810 align:start position:0%
Kensington Southampton Newton and
Plaistow

06:14:50.810 --> 06:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
Plaistow
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I Rise to present uh
 
06:14:58.368 --> 06:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
this current let this current bill
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and I have provided you which is a
 
06:15:06.010 --> 06:15:06.020 align:start position:0%
bill which would essentially in my view
 
06:15:09.230 --> 06:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
consolidate uh further consolidate
 
06:15:09.240 --> 06:15:11.208 align:start position:0%
consolidate uh further consolidate
functions

06:15:11.208 --> 06:15:11.218 align:start position:0%
functions
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
um in the department of energy as part
 
06:15:16.670 --> 06:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the overall transition that divided
 
06:15:21.708 --> 06:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
the puc from uh from and created a
 
06:15:23.708 --> 06:15:23.718 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
and that is to move the easy board the
 
06:15:30.590 --> 06:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
remaining easy board functions back into
 
06:15:33.170 --> 06:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
so what what I gave you a handout which
 
06:15:41.690 --> 06:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
contains the uh the statute that created
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
the easy board and its functions and you
 
06:15:48.170 --> 06:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.970 --> 06:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
the second page uh is is I find very
 
06:15:56.090 --> 06:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
interesting it's the easy board uh
 
06:15:58.910 --> 06:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
statement of governing principles
 
06:16:01.730 --> 06:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
and and there's there's only two things
 
06:16:04.190 --> 06:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
that they currently still have yet to do
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
because one of the main functions that
 
06:16:12.470 --> 06:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
they had up until last session was to
 
06:16:16.910 --> 06:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
recommend uh changes to
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
um system benefit charge rates but we
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
changed that to be a legislatively
 
06:16:26.868 --> 06:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
mandated uh amount with an escalator on
 
06:16:30.530 --> 06:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
an annualized basis so what remains is
 
06:16:32.330 --> 06:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
promoting and coordinating Energy
 
06:16:34.490 --> 06:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency demand response and
 
06:16:36.530 --> 06:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy programs in the state
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
and to make recommendations regarding
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
that all the rest of the easy boards uh
 
06:16:46.570 --> 06:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
operational functions
 
06:16:49.990 --> 06:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
a through H are
 
06:16:52.970 --> 06:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
essentially administrative who sits on
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the board how the meeting meetings occur
 
06:16:58.610 --> 06:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
how you get the um
 
06:17:01.368 --> 06:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
information to and from the board but
 
06:17:03.770 --> 06:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there just describing
 
06:17:05.390 --> 06:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
06:17:05.400 --> 06:17:07.430 align:start position:0%
the policy
um

06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:11.690 --> 06:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:13.150 --> 06:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
the department of Energy's
 
06:17:16.970 --> 06:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they're
 
06:17:20.628 --> 06:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
key is key among them is making policy
 
06:17:23.990 --> 06:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
making possible increased efficiency and
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
economics from integrated Administration
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that that mission is part of the uh
 
06:17:31.920 --> 06:17:33.048 align:start position:0%
and that that mission is part of the uh
energy

06:17:33.048 --> 06:17:33.058 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:17:36.650 --> 06:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
um is also parroted in the mission
 
06:17:39.530 --> 06:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
statement affordable inevitable reliable
 
06:17:42.410 --> 06:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
and sustainable energy economy and that
 
06:17:44.990 --> 06:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
tasking is given to the division of
 
06:17:48.430 --> 06:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
so as I looked at what's left of the
 
06:17:55.788 --> 06:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
easy boards life it seems to me it's
 
06:17:58.430 --> 06:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
redundant it fits in the department of
 
06:18:01.610 --> 06:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
energy and hence the legislation that
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
I've proposed
 
06:18:08.330 --> 06:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:10.910 --> 06:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi for
 
06:18:10.920 --> 06:18:12.410 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi for
introducing

06:18:12.410 --> 06:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
06:18:15.048 --> 06:18:15.058 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
06:18:17.570 --> 06:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
before I entertain questions for you
 
06:18:19.010 --> 06:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:18:19.020 --> 06:18:19.730 align:start position:0%
from the
um

06:18:19.730 --> 06:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:22.910 --> 06:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'd like to
 
06:18:26.208 --> 06:18:26.218 align:start position:0%
read the a portion of the letter
 
06:18:28.128 --> 06:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
submitted by Jared chicoine the
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
06:18:34.310 --> 06:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
regarding this legislation
 
06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
the department has adopted a neutral
 
06:18:40.610 --> 06:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.910 --> 06:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they say that
 
06:18:46.128 --> 06:18:46.138 align:start position:0%
if the legislature decides to move
 
06:18:47.628 --> 06:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
06:18:52.670 --> 06:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
this re organization of
 
06:18:54.890 --> 06:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
easy board tasks the department of
 
06:18:57.890 --> 06:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
energy will be willing and able to take
 
06:19:00.048 --> 06:19:00.058 align:start position:0%
on their responsibilities transferred in
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 622 with no need for
 
06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.548 --> 06:19:10.558 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted that to be clear thank
 
06:19:12.530 --> 06:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
you uh members
 
06:19:14.570 --> 06:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
have questions for representative
 
06:19:16.850 --> 06:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
Bernardi representative Noel has a
 
06:19:16.860 --> 06:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
Bernardi representative Noel has a
question

06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:19:19.730 --> 06:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:19:22.190 --> 06:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh does the bill
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
disband the easy board and just reassign
 
06:19:28.250 --> 06:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
the duties to the Department of energy
 
06:19:31.670 --> 06:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
or is the board just reconstituted in
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
the department of energy no the the
 
06:19:37.128 --> 06:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
concept is to to disband the board and
 
06:19:38.990 --> 06:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
transfer the responsibilities to the
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
06:19:43.490 --> 06:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and and hence save money one of the
 
06:19:46.010 --> 06:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
taskings we've heard continually through
 
06:19:48.288 --> 06:19:48.298 align:start position:0%
this this year is we have too many
 
06:19:50.868 --> 06:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
commissions too many boards uh we don't
 
06:19:53.690 --> 06:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
even have the people to uh
 
06:19:56.890 --> 06:19:56.900 align:start position:0%
sit on these boards to make to make them
 
06:19:56.900 --> 06:19:58.448 align:start position:0%
sit on these boards to make to make them
functional

06:19:58.448 --> 06:19:58.458 align:start position:0%
functional
 
06:20:01.490 --> 06:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
when I looked at this board and looked
 
06:20:03.288 --> 06:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
at the tasking of the new Department of
 
06:20:05.628 --> 06:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
energy this seemed to fit right within
 
06:20:05.638 --> 06:20:06.670 align:start position:0%
energy this seemed to fit right within
their

06:20:06.670 --> 06:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
basket of tasks and and it was a
 
06:20:13.730 --> 06:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
redundant or parallel board that we
 
06:20:16.250 --> 06:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
already have a state plan on energy
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
these folks work on plans that the
 
06:20:20.280 --> 06:20:22.330 align:start position:0%
these folks work on plans that the
energy

06:20:22.330 --> 06:20:22.340 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:20:24.708 --> 06:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
sustainability Energy Efficiency ought
 
06:20:26.570 --> 06:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
to be a part of that state plan so why
 
06:20:30.730 --> 06:20:30.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.990 --> 06:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
um can you please give me an idea of the
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
time commitment for this board how often
 
06:20:40.128 --> 06:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
they meet
 
06:20:43.310 --> 06:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um how much they're I mean what time is
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
06:20:49.010 --> 06:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
I am going to ask our chairman to answer
 
06:20:51.048 --> 06:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
that question as he is a member of the
 
06:20:52.850 --> 06:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
board and can give a better answer than
 
06:20:52.860 --> 06:20:54.590 align:start position:0%
board and can give a better answer than
I

06:20:54.590 --> 06:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:20:57.288 --> 06:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer that question I
 
06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
do serve on the easy board I've been on
 
06:21:02.090 --> 06:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
two plus years now and the board meets
 
06:21:09.288 --> 06:21:09.298 align:start position:0%
monthly at the department of energy
 
06:21:09.298 --> 06:21:10.970 align:start position:0%
monthly at the department of energy
headquarters

06:21:10.970 --> 06:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
headquarters
 
06:21:13.970 --> 06:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
The Walker building on
 
06:21:17.390 --> 06:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
um what's the name of that street well
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hayes and drive up the street no it's
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
not Hazen drive it's all Pleasant
 
06:21:25.548 --> 06:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
off Pleasant yeah yeah anyway
 
06:21:25.558 --> 06:21:26.270 align:start position:0%
off Pleasant yeah yeah anyway
um

06:21:26.270 --> 06:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
so they meet monthly
 
06:21:31.788 --> 06:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
um the members of the board
 
06:21:33.948 --> 06:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
probably don't have a lot to do
 
06:21:33.958 --> 06:21:36.048 align:start position:0%
probably don't have a lot to do
individually

06:21:36.048 --> 06:21:36.058 align:start position:0%
individually
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
between meetings the board chairman and
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
vice chairman have work to do to set the
 
06:21:46.128 --> 06:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
agenda and organize the meetings and
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
arrange for speakers to come before the
 
06:21:51.650 --> 06:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
board so there is some work to be done
 
06:21:51.660 --> 06:21:53.330 align:start position:0%
board so there is some work to be done
there

06:21:53.330 --> 06:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:21:53.340 --> 06:21:55.250 align:start position:0%
there
um

06:21:55.250 --> 06:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
but beyond that
 
06:22:00.590 --> 06:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
there is no real extensive time
 
06:22:03.770 --> 06:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
commitment for members of the board
 
06:22:05.390 --> 06:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
that answer your question yeah it does
 
06:22:06.830 --> 06:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
06:22:12.650 --> 06:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I my experience
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the easy board is is a little bit
 
06:22:17.230 --> 06:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the past so yours is probably more
 
06:22:20.330 --> 06:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
recent but I know that it's one of its
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
principal functions is to bring
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh non-governmental voices into the
 
06:22:29.390 --> 06:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
06:22:32.170 --> 06:22:32.180 align:start position:0%
you know that what was then
 
06:22:34.610 --> 06:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know predecessors to Department
 
06:22:36.410 --> 06:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
of energy now to the Department of
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
energy so our
 
06:22:43.490 --> 06:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
I I hear I see the letter that the doe
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
says we could take over the
 
06:22:47.690 --> 06:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but are are you at all
 
06:22:52.190 --> 06:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that losing the venue uh of
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
input from people who are not of the
 
06:22:57.530 --> 06:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that that would be
 
06:22:59.330 --> 06:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
a loss to the state
 
06:22:59.340 --> 06:23:01.610 align:start position:0%
a loss to the state
uh

06:23:01.610 --> 06:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:03.530 --> 06:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
I I believe the department of energy
 
06:23:06.708 --> 06:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
when it's addressing its state plan or
 
06:23:09.410 --> 06:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
any of these issues can call whatever
 
06:23:11.570 --> 06:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
members it wants and at whatever
 
06:23:15.288 --> 06:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
resources it wants to investigate and
 
06:23:18.770 --> 06:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
flush out uh issues that it's working on
 
06:23:22.730 --> 06:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
and and to do that they probably will
 
06:23:26.208 --> 06:23:26.218 align:start position:0%
call on external forces or external uh
 
06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
talent to to address those questions so
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not worried about any loss of of uh
 
06:23:35.090 --> 06:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
potential outside information
 
06:23:38.930 --> 06:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:43.250 --> 06:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:45.708 --> 06:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for the
 
06:23:47.208 --> 06:23:47.218 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor I want to thank you for
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation
 
06:23:52.788 --> 06:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
and I only have one pink card left so
 
06:23:55.548 --> 06:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Meredith Hatfield
 
06:23:58.010 --> 06:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
to testify give us and give us her
 
06:23:59.690 --> 06:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
perspective on this
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
legislation welcome back thank you very
 
06:24:04.010 --> 06:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
much good afternoon Meredith Hatfield
 
06:24:06.530 --> 06:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
for The Nature Conservancy
 
06:24:06.540 --> 06:24:07.570 align:start position:0%
for The Nature Conservancy
um

06:24:07.570 --> 06:24:07.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:10.670 --> 06:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
my colleague Bruce Clendening actually
 
06:24:13.190 --> 06:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of chairing the easy
 
06:24:15.890 --> 06:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
board over the last year
 
06:24:18.350 --> 06:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and so I just wanted to acknowledge
 
06:24:21.530 --> 06:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
his service to the to the easy board and
 
06:24:23.090 --> 06:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
I had the privilege of being one of the
 
06:24:24.830 --> 06:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
original members when it was first
 
06:24:24.840 --> 06:24:27.048 align:start position:0%
original members when it was first
created

06:24:27.048 --> 06:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
created
 
06:24:29.690 --> 06:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
I I do think that
 
06:24:32.890 --> 06:24:32.900 align:start position:0%
um the easy board perhaps in a new
 
06:24:37.970 --> 06:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
version could still really provide
 
06:24:40.670 --> 06:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
um benefits to the folks who are trying
 
06:24:42.590 --> 06:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
to learn about these issues and Advance
 
06:24:42.600 --> 06:24:43.910 align:start position:0%
to learn about these issues and Advance
them

06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:24:46.610 --> 06:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
and I I think if the department of
 
06:24:49.250 --> 06:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
energy is willing to take on these tasks
 
06:24:52.250 --> 06:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a wonderful thing I I
 
06:24:54.650 --> 06:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
one thing I I did want to raise for your
 
06:24:54.660 --> 06:24:56.330 align:start position:0%
one thing I I did want to raise for your
consideration

06:24:56.330 --> 06:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:24:59.930 --> 06:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
is the public input aspect of the easy
 
06:25:02.810 --> 06:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
board and and that educational that open
 
06:25:05.150 --> 06:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
sort of free exchange of ideas and
 
06:25:07.670 --> 06:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
information and I just wanted to note
 
06:25:10.128 --> 06:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
the members of the easy board that you
 
06:25:12.470 --> 06:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
set into statute a number of years ago
 
06:25:14.350 --> 06:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
that include
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislators which I think is really
 
06:25:21.170 --> 06:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
valuable for folks in the field and in
 
06:25:23.270 --> 06:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
state government to have places where
 
06:25:25.368 --> 06:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
they can informally interact with
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
legislators and hear about your
 
06:25:28.670 --> 06:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
priorities and your questions and also
 
06:25:31.310 --> 06:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
share their views
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
um having the Bia at the table
 
06:25:36.350 --> 06:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
Des the Department of Business and
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs the municipal
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
Association New Hampshire legal
 
06:25:41.930 --> 06:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
assistance on behalf of their low-income
 
06:25:44.990 --> 06:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
clients the home builders and remodelers
 
06:25:47.510 --> 06:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
Association I think has really brought
 
06:25:48.770 --> 06:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
some really
 
06:25:51.230 --> 06:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
um unique and helpful perspectives to
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
some of these questions
 
06:25:53.878 --> 06:25:54.948 align:start position:0%
some of these questions
um

06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:57.890 --> 06:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
and there are other agencies on on the
 
06:25:59.330 --> 06:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
easy board as well I won't go through
 
06:26:01.910 --> 06:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
each one but you know I I would
 
06:26:04.610 --> 06:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
encourage you to think about how to
 
06:26:07.128 --> 06:26:07.138 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
06:26:10.070 --> 06:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
um there's some type of a venue for the
 
06:26:12.110 --> 06:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to hear from folks
 
06:26:14.090 --> 06:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
in the field and I would note that
 
06:26:16.730 --> 06:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
during the development of the last
 
06:26:20.448 --> 06:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
um State energy strategy I think because
 
06:26:22.730 --> 06:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic there were not public
 
06:26:24.590 --> 06:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
hearings or public meetings held to
 
06:26:27.770 --> 06:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
gather input whereas back in 2014 when
 
06:26:29.448 --> 06:26:29.458 align:start position:0%
we did the first state energy strategy
 
06:26:31.070 --> 06:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
we did field hearings all around the
 
06:26:34.070 --> 06:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
state which was really a helpful way to
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
talk to people you know in different
 
06:26:39.110 --> 06:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
parts different corners of the state so
 
06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
I would urge you that if you go in this
 
06:26:40.860 --> 06:26:42.350 align:start position:0%
I would urge you that if you go in this
direction

06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
direction
 
06:26:46.070 --> 06:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
to to perhaps
 
06:26:48.110 --> 06:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
and monthly meetings probably aren't
 
06:26:50.810 --> 06:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
necessary but to have some ability for
 
06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
the public to interact with the
 
06:26:52.860 --> 06:26:53.708 align:start position:0%
the public to interact with the
Department

06:26:53.708 --> 06:26:53.718 align:start position:0%
Department
 
06:26:56.270 --> 06:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
from you know a variety of perspectives
 
06:26:58.610 --> 06:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
and to be able to share information from
 
06:27:00.770 --> 06:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
the field because some of those folks
 
06:27:02.990 --> 06:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
Implement our programs and like the cap
 
06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
agencies attend the easy board often and
 
06:27:08.510 --> 06:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's really helpful to hear directly
 
06:27:10.910 --> 06:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
from the folks on the ground and just
 
06:27:13.430 --> 06:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
one other example of where I I have
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
found the easy board to be really
 
06:27:16.970 --> 06:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
helpful is there have been a couple of
 
06:27:19.250 --> 06:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
presentations on the federal funding
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
that will be available that is relevant
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
to these types of programs whether it be
 
06:27:26.868 --> 06:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency or distributed energy
 
06:27:30.770 --> 06:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
and that that is just such a resource
 
06:27:33.110 --> 06:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
for people who are trying to serve
 
06:27:35.530 --> 06:27:35.540 align:start position:0%
customers serve clients
 
06:27:38.208 --> 06:27:38.218 align:start position:0%
build businesses in New Hampshire so
 
06:27:40.250 --> 06:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
having that place that you can go and
 
06:27:42.110 --> 06:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
have that free exchange of ideas and
 
06:27:43.750 --> 06:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
share information I think is is is
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
invaluable and as someone who's had the
 
06:27:50.030 --> 06:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
The Good Fortune of serving in state
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
government I can tell you
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
um you know it really enriches
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
um has enriched my ability to to feel
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
like I was
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
um advancing policy issues with an ear
 
06:28:03.170 --> 06:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
toward what what folks in New Hampshire
 
06:28:04.310 --> 06:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
cared about
 
06:28:08.990 --> 06:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:10.430 --> 06:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Hatfield for your
 
06:28:10.440 --> 06:28:12.288 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Hatfield for your
perspective

06:28:12.288 --> 06:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
you raised an interesting point in your
 
06:28:16.490 --> 06:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
testimony you said
 
06:28:18.770 --> 06:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to see
 
06:28:22.490 --> 06:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:25.368 --> 06:28:25.378 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for public input should the
 
06:28:26.810 --> 06:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
department of energy take over this
 
06:28:26.820 --> 06:28:28.970 align:start position:0%
department of energy take over this
function

06:28:28.970 --> 06:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
function
 
06:28:31.070 --> 06:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
would you think that it would be
 
06:28:32.930 --> 06:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
advisable for us to amend this
 
06:28:36.350 --> 06:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislation to create maybe a an
 
06:28:38.270 --> 06:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
06:28:40.430 --> 06:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
with members of the public
 
06:28:43.490 --> 06:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
who could serve in a
 
06:28:46.090 --> 06:28:46.100 align:start position:0%
quarterly or a semi-annual
 
06:28:49.548 --> 06:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
advisory capacity to the Department
 
06:28:51.948 --> 06:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vos
 
06:28:53.270 --> 06:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that that is
 
06:28:56.510 --> 06:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
certainly one one possibility I I would
 
06:28:56.520 --> 06:28:57.708 align:start position:0%
certainly one one possibility I I would
certainly

06:28:57.708 --> 06:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:28:59.330 --> 06:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
um want to have you here directly from
 
06:29:00.948 --> 06:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy about what
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
might work for them and what other
 
06:29:03.890 --> 06:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
structures they might have on different
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
topics that they find useful I would
 
06:29:08.510 --> 06:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
also note that the assistant
 
06:29:10.788 --> 06:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Des is now the new chair
 
06:29:14.030 --> 06:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the easy board and he certainly has
 
06:29:16.250 --> 06:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
vast experience with public processes
 
06:29:18.708 --> 06:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
and I think Des has a number of those
 
06:29:20.930 --> 06:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
types of boards and and advisory
 
06:29:24.890 --> 06:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
committees so I think that um between
 
06:29:27.470 --> 06:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh the leader new leadership of the easy
 
06:29:29.690 --> 06:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
board and Folks at the doe they may have
 
06:29:31.850 --> 06:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
some good thoughts about the best way to
 
06:29:34.730 --> 06:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.788 --> 06:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up can you elaborate a little bit
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
about about the advisory boards within
 
06:29:40.558 --> 06:29:41.810 align:start position:0%
about about the advisory boards within
Des

06:29:41.810 --> 06:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
Des
 
06:29:45.170 --> 06:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
so two that um come to mind are the
 
06:29:48.650 --> 06:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
rivers and lakes advisory committees and
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not getting their names
 
06:29:51.410 --> 06:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
exactly right they're two separate
 
06:29:56.330 --> 06:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
bodies but they work with Des to provide
 
06:29:59.150 --> 06:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know citizen input about rivers and
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and I and I've heard Des testify
 
06:30:04.070 --> 06:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that they find them to be very helpful
 
06:30:06.530 --> 06:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
when there's people on the ground you
 
06:30:08.090 --> 06:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
know watching for lakes and rivers
 
06:30:11.750 --> 06:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
issues that it's really helpful
 
06:30:13.730 --> 06:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
06:30:15.530 --> 06:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
further questions from Miss Hatfield
 
06:30:18.048 --> 06:30:18.058 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr
 
06:30:20.570 --> 06:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for testifying
 
06:30:24.048 --> 06:30:24.058 align:start position:0%
I I share your concern about the lack of
 
06:30:27.288 --> 06:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
or the loss of uh input from some of the
 
06:30:30.230 --> 06:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
constituents constituencies that you you
 
06:30:32.030 --> 06:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
identified and
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
um you you you actually or chairman Voss
 
06:30:36.830 --> 06:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
actually asked my question and you
 
06:30:38.690 --> 06:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
answered it and I guess I would say that
 
06:30:41.448 --> 06:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
you know I would certainly be open to
 
06:30:43.010 --> 06:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
trying to do something to create some
 
06:30:44.750 --> 06:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
kind of an Advisory Board
 
06:30:46.730 --> 06:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
within the department of energy
 
06:30:49.070 --> 06:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and let me say too that it's
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
not just about the department hearing
 
06:30:52.610 --> 06:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
from the public the public I think is
 
06:30:54.170 --> 06:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
hungry to hear from the Department as
 
06:30:56.570 --> 06:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
well so really having that that two-way
 
06:31:01.430 --> 06:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:04.548 --> 06:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
additional questions for Miss Hatfield
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
see none I want to thank you for coming
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%

06:31:11.448 --> 06:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
perspective to this discussion thank you
 
06:31:14.750 --> 06:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
and having no additional pink cards for
 
06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'll call this public
 
06:31:20.030 --> 06:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
hearing closed and ask representative
 
06:31:22.610 --> 06:31:22.620 align:start position:0%

you

06:32:30.048 --> 06:32:30.058 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:32:32.990 --> 06:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much before we conclude
 
06:32:35.090 --> 06:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
our business today although I would like
 
06:32:36.470 --> 06:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
to get everybody out of here a little
 
06:32:38.330 --> 06:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
bit early
 
06:32:40.010 --> 06:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
have a couple of things that I want to
 
06:32:42.230 --> 06:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
talk about one number one is at the
 
06:32:43.310 --> 06:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of
 
06:32:45.770 --> 06:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
today's meeting I suggested that next
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
week because we lose Tuesday due to a a
 
06:32:52.190 --> 06:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
session a house session that we would
 
06:32:54.770 --> 06:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
likely have a committee day on either
 
06:32:57.708 --> 06:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
Thursday or Friday
 
06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
well after consultation with uh
 
06:33:02.690 --> 06:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative hunt who chairs the
 
06:33:04.910 --> 06:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee which with whom we
 
06:33:06.590 --> 06:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
share this room
 
06:33:08.930 --> 06:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
it turns out they have already scheduled
 
06:33:11.510 --> 06:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
this room for Thursday so it looks like
 
06:33:14.510 --> 06:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
if we meet again a second time next week
 
06:33:17.570 --> 06:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that uh we won't
 
06:33:23.570 --> 06:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
meet that day I have to figure that out
 
06:33:26.330 --> 06:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
tonight I have to determine how many
 
06:33:29.570 --> 06:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
bills we have left to hear Etc
 
06:33:31.730 --> 06:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
I do have a conflict that day the easy
 
06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
board meets that that day so
 
06:33:35.280 --> 06:33:36.110 align:start position:0%
board meets that that day so
um

06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:38.150 --> 06:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have to meet that day that
 
06:33:41.150 --> 06:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
would be that would be useful because
 
06:33:42.830 --> 06:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the easy board is going to want
 
06:33:44.690 --> 06:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
to ask me what happened at the public
 
06:33:46.610 --> 06:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
hearing here today
 
06:33:46.620 --> 06:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
hearing here today
so

06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:51.948 --> 06:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
I would ask you all to reserve Friday
 
06:33:51.958 --> 06:33:53.810 align:start position:0%
I would ask you all to reserve Friday
until

06:33:53.810 --> 06:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
until
 
06:33:58.070 --> 06:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
I know next Friday Friday the 17th and
 
06:33:59.930 --> 06:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me would that do I need to raise
 
06:34:02.330 --> 06:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
my hand representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:34:05.750 --> 06:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um would that in involve an
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
executive session as well on Friday or
 
06:34:09.830 --> 06:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
is it just bill hearings
 
06:34:11.750 --> 06:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
potentially it would involve executive
 
06:34:15.288 --> 06:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
sessions too we we have to keep up with
 
06:34:15.298 --> 06:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
sessions too we we have to keep up with
the

06:34:16.430 --> 06:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:34:18.770 --> 06:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
with the executive sessions otherwise
 
06:34:21.110 --> 06:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
we'll find ourselves in a position
 
06:34:23.868 --> 06:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
I've I've talked about this before we'll
 
06:34:25.490 --> 06:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in the position that we
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
were in last year where we had this huge
 
06:34:30.410 --> 06:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
ton of bills dumped on the house floor
 
06:34:34.010 --> 06:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
all at once and we ran out of time to to
 
06:34:35.930 --> 06:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
address them and so the speaker asked me
 
06:34:38.590 --> 06:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
to table bills
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
itl bills so there was no debate on the
 
06:34:43.670 --> 06:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
house floor on those bills
 
06:34:46.368 --> 06:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
well not only would that be difficult
 
06:34:49.670 --> 06:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
this year because many of our bills are
 
06:34:51.048 --> 06:34:51.058 align:start position:0%
going to end up going to the house floor
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
06:34:56.510 --> 06:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible you know you
 
06:34:58.128 --> 06:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
can't table a bill that's without
 
06:35:00.288 --> 06:35:00.298 align:start position:0%
recommendation I don't think I suppose
 
06:35:02.570 --> 06:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
you could but I don't think a tabling
 
06:35:05.448 --> 06:35:05.458 align:start position:0%
motion would pass so
 
06:35:07.670 --> 06:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm trying to avoid the situation
 
06:35:09.470 --> 06:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
where we dump
 
06:35:13.128 --> 06:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
25 bills on the house in two days so
 
06:35:14.810 --> 06:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
we're trying to keep up with with the
 
06:35:16.910 --> 06:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and getting these
 
06:35:19.128 --> 06:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
bills out the door that's that's that's
 
06:35:23.948 --> 06:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:25.910 --> 06:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman
 
06:35:28.490 --> 06:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman what's the time
 
06:35:30.410 --> 06:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
frame for when we have to get all our
 
06:35:32.690 --> 06:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
bills out and exact I'm counting that we
 
06:35:37.128 --> 06:35:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:39.170 --> 06:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have my calendar right in
 
06:35:42.190 --> 06:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
front of me but I think the deadline to
 
06:35:45.110 --> 06:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
finish all bills is somewhere around the
 
06:35:46.788 --> 06:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
20th of March
 
06:35:46.798 --> 06:35:49.128 align:start position:0%
20th of March
so

06:35:49.128 --> 06:35:49.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:51.650 --> 06:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
um representative Thomas has his
 
06:35:59.628 --> 06:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.490 --> 06:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:08.690 --> 06:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
all remaining house bills is
 
06:36:11.030 --> 06:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
last day to report on all house bills
 
06:36:13.010 --> 06:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
not in a second committee
 
06:36:20.208 --> 06:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:22.490 --> 06:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
last day to report all remaining house
 
06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
bills is March 20th
 
06:36:28.670 --> 06:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
or 30th rather I misread that 30th
 
06:36:28.680 --> 06:36:31.010 align:start position:0%
or 30th rather I misread that 30th
so

06:36:31.010 --> 06:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:32.810 --> 06:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
basically what that means is they all
 
06:36:34.190 --> 06:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
on the house floor by March 30th
 
06:36:39.590 --> 06:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
so typically you would try to get them
 
06:36:41.990 --> 06:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
there before the 30th but seems to me
 
06:36:44.750 --> 06:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
that we have enough time then that we
 
06:36:46.670 --> 06:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to use Friday next week
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
if we have 11 more to hear and you know
 
06:36:51.590 --> 06:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
that plus the ones that we've heard and
 
06:36:53.030 --> 06:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
have been exact it seems like we have
 
06:36:53.040 --> 06:36:53.868 align:start position:0%
have been exact it seems like we have
time

06:36:53.868 --> 06:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
well that's one of the things I have to
 
06:36:58.850 --> 06:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and representative
 
06:37:00.590 --> 06:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
Bernardi and I have to get our heads
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
together and collaborate and figure out
 
06:37:05.270 --> 06:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
exactly how we can get the remaining
 
06:37:06.890 --> 06:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
bills heard
 
06:37:10.128 --> 06:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
and exact in conformance with these
 
06:37:10.138 --> 06:37:12.230 align:start position:0%
and exact in conformance with these
dates

06:37:12.230 --> 06:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
dates
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
so I that's why I'm asking you to
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
reserve Friday we may need it we may not
 
06:37:18.958 --> 06:37:20.270 align:start position:0%
reserve Friday we may need it we may not
um

06:37:20.270 --> 06:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be to meet during
 
06:37:24.650 --> 06:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
the week of vacation
 
06:37:26.810 --> 06:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
even though the house Speaker has asked
 
06:37:29.208 --> 06:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
us not to meet that week
 
06:37:31.250 --> 06:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we we can't meet that
 
06:37:33.170 --> 06:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
week we can
 
06:37:37.368 --> 06:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
um so that would be the alternative
 
06:37:40.250 --> 06:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
so if you want that week off
 
06:37:42.350 --> 06:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
then you'll make yourselves available to
 
06:37:44.090 --> 06:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
meet before that so we can have that
 
06:37:47.330 --> 06:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:50.090 --> 06:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
06:37:51.708 --> 06:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
and then there was one other thing I was
 
06:37:57.530 --> 06:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:00.170 --> 06:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes we we lose President's Day Monday
 
06:38:01.490 --> 06:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
the 20th
 
06:38:03.410 --> 06:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's another reason why
 
06:38:03.420 --> 06:38:04.250 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's another reason why
we're

06:38:04.250 --> 06:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:38:07.010 --> 06:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
we've already lost one Monday now we're
 
06:38:08.930 --> 06:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
going to lose the second Monday we've
 
06:38:10.910 --> 06:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
lost one Tuesday and then we lost
 
06:38:13.010 --> 06:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
another Monday because of snow so we've
 
06:38:14.690 --> 06:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
lost four
 
06:38:17.448 --> 06:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
committee days which potentially if
 
06:38:19.310 --> 06:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
could allow us to we made up the snow
 
06:38:22.730 --> 06:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
day we did make up the snow day but
 
06:38:25.430 --> 06:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're still behind we're still behind so
 
06:38:27.650 --> 06:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry did you were you serious
 
06:38:29.448 --> 06:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
about us meeting during winter vacation
 
06:38:32.810 --> 06:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:35.930 --> 06:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
I said it's an option and one I'd really
 
06:38:38.930 --> 06:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
really like to avoid uh all right well I
 
06:38:57.530 --> 06:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:59.390 --> 06:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody else have anything
 
06:39:01.850 --> 06:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
else they want to uh bring to the
 
06:39:04.730 --> 06:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
attention to the committee
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing I will thank you all for
 
06:39:10.430 --> 06:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
your hard work these last two days and
 
06:39:10.440 --> 06:39:11.448 align:start position:0%
your hard work these last two days and
uh

06:39:11.448 --> 06:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:13.730 --> 06:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
we'll see you uh
 
06:39:16.730 --> 06:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
what is today yeah today's Tuesday we'll
 
06:39:19.910 --> 06:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
see you next Tuesday
 
06:39:22.730 --> 06:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
and the uh next Monday the Delta Dental
 
06:39:25.010 --> 06:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
thing is tonight as well
 
06:39:27.170 --> 06:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental
 
06:39:29.810 --> 06:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's oh that's tonight yeah that's
 
06:39:32.510 --> 06:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
tonight I'd lost track of that so there
 
06:39:35.570 --> 06:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
is a reception for for Delta Dental I
 
06:39:37.368 --> 06:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
cannot go because I have a deliberative
 
06:39:38.990 --> 06:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
session in my town
 
06:39:40.970 --> 06:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
I have to be there so
 
06:39:44.208 --> 06:39:44.218 align:start position:0%
I can't go to Delta Dental to all right
