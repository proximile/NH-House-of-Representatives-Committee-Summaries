and
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.509 align:start position:0%
and
then<00:14:41.680><c> you</c><00:14:42.000><c> didn't</c><00:14:42.399><c> come</c><00:14:42.639><c> to</c><00:14:42.800><c> an</c><00:14:42.959><c> agreement</c>

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
then you didn't come to an agreement
 

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.509 align:start position:0%
then you didn't come to an agreement
obviously<00:14:44.079><c> that</c><00:14:44.320><c> could</c><00:14:44.880><c> i</c><00:14:44.959><c> mean</c><00:14:45.120><c> that</c><00:14:45.360><c> could</c>

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
obviously that could i mean that could
 

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.230 align:start position:0%
obviously that could i mean that could
be<00:14:45.600><c> a</c><00:14:45.760><c> problem</c><00:14:46.399><c> uh</c><00:14:46.639><c> and</c><00:14:46.800><c> so</c><00:14:46.959><c> i</c><00:14:47.279><c> guess</c><00:14:47.440><c> what</c><00:14:47.680><c> i'm</c>

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
be a problem uh and so i guess what i'm
 

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
be a problem uh and so i guess what i'm
what<00:14:48.480><c> i'm</c><00:14:48.720><c> wondering</c><00:14:49.199><c> is</c>

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering is
 

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering is
is<00:14:50.480><c> the</c>

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
is the
 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.430 align:start position:0%
is the
because<00:14:51.839><c> because</c><00:14:52.560><c> then</c><00:14:52.800><c> we</c><00:14:52.959><c> couldn't</c><00:14:53.279><c> do</c>

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
because because then we couldn't do
 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.949 align:start position:0%
because because then we couldn't do
anything<00:14:53.760><c> until</c><00:14:54.000><c> the</c><00:14:54.160><c> next</c><00:14:54.399><c> legislative</c>

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
anything until the next legislative
 

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
anything until the next legislative
session<00:14:55.360><c> and</c><00:14:55.440><c> so</c><00:14:55.600><c> i</c><00:14:55.680><c> guess</c><00:14:55.920><c> the</c><00:14:56.399><c> the</c><00:14:56.560><c> only</c>

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
session and so i guess the the only
 

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
session and so i guess the the only
question<00:14:57.279><c> would</c><00:14:57.440><c> be</c><00:14:57.920><c> let's</c><00:14:58.240><c> assume</c><00:14:58.560><c> you</c>

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
question would be let's assume you
 

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
question would be let's assume you
didn't<00:14:59.199><c> come</c><00:14:59.360><c> to</c><00:14:59.519><c> an</c><00:14:59.680><c> agreement</c><00:15:00.480><c> what's</c><00:15:00.800><c> the</c>

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
didn't come to an agreement what's the
 

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.269 align:start position:0%
didn't come to an agreement what's the

yes<00:16:43.279><c> so</c><00:16:43.519><c> i</c><00:16:43.600><c> think</c><00:16:43.839><c> if</c><00:16:44.000><c> you</c><00:16:44.399><c> did</c><00:16:44.560><c> an</c><00:16:44.720><c> interim</c>

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes so i think if you did an interim
 

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.110 align:start position:0%
yes so i think if you did an interim
study

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
study
 

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
study
you'd<00:16:47.360><c> still</c><00:16:47.519><c> be</c><00:16:47.680><c> subject</c><00:16:48.000><c> to</c><00:16:48.160><c> that</c><00:16:48.560><c> i</c><00:16:48.639><c> don't</c>

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
you'd still be subject to that i don't
 

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.069 align:start position:0%
you'd still be subject to that i don't
think<00:16:48.959><c> you</c><00:16:49.040><c> could</c><00:16:49.199><c> take</c><00:16:49.360><c> it</c><00:16:49.440><c> out</c><00:16:49.519><c> of</c><00:16:49.680><c> interim</c>

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
think you could take it out of interim
 

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.829 align:start position:0%
think you could take it out of interim
study<00:16:50.399><c> after</c><00:16:50.880><c> your</c><00:16:51.040><c> report</c><00:16:51.440><c> deadline</c><00:16:51.759><c> of</c>

00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay so i could skip the 10th deadline
 

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.590 align:start position:0%
okay so i could skip the 10th deadline

took this off of exec session for the
eighth<00:17:02.399><c> i</c><00:17:02.560><c> think</c><00:17:02.800><c> we've</c><00:17:03.040><c> got</c><00:17:03.279><c> until</c><00:17:04.319><c> um</c>

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
to give them 500 000
 

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
to give them 500 000
absolutely<00:20:14.240><c> so</c><00:20:14.640><c> that's</c><00:20:14.880><c> our</c><00:20:15.120><c> job</c>

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely so that's our job
 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
absolutely so that's our job
so<00:20:16.720><c> maybe</c>

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
so maybe
 

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
so maybe
with<00:20:17.840><c> that</c><00:20:18.559><c> consideration</c><00:20:19.360><c> we</c><00:20:19.520><c> know</c><00:20:19.679><c> we're</c>

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
with that consideration we know we're
 

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
with that consideration we know we're
not<00:20:20.000><c> going</c><00:20:20.080><c> to</c><00:20:20.159><c> give</c><00:20:20.400><c> them</c><00:20:20.559><c> money</c>

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
not going to give them money
 

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
not going to give them money
um<00:20:22.000><c> and</c><00:20:22.159><c> we're</c><00:20:22.320><c> not</c><00:20:22.480><c> a</c><00:20:22.559><c> policy</c><00:20:23.039><c> committee</c>

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and we're not a policy committee
 

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.789 align:start position:0%
um and we're not a policy committee
so<00:20:24.720><c> maybe</c><00:20:25.039><c> it's</c><00:20:25.200><c> just</c><00:20:25.440><c> a</c><00:20:25.520><c> matter</c><00:20:25.760><c> of</c><00:20:25.840><c> saying</c><00:20:26.240><c> no</c>

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's just a matter of saying no
 

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's just a matter of saying no
in<00:20:26.960><c> this</c><00:20:27.200><c> case</c>

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
in this case
 

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.669 align:start position:0%
in this case
we<00:20:28.640><c> are</c>

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
we are
 

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
we are

because
 

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.630 align:start position:0%

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%

and i think um we saw that
 

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.510 align:start position:0%
and i think um we saw that
representative<00:23:19.760><c> mari</c><00:23:20.080><c> did</c><00:23:20.320><c> do</c><00:23:20.559><c> that</c>

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we identified the fact that those
 

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
and we identified the fact that those
rules

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules
 

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.549 align:start position:0%

were<00:23:25.200><c> put</c><00:23:25.440><c> in</c><00:23:25.600><c> place</c>

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
were put in place
 

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
