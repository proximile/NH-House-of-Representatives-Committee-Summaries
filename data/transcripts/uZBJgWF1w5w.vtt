anyhow that's uh that's what's going on
um

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
and sarah welcome um why don't you just
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
um i know that uh
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
you have never
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
been with division two before
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
and so we uh we certainly welcome you
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're very friendly
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.350 align:start position:0%
okay and
and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
99 of the time we get along
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's one of the the fun things about
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
being on division two
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
so um i will tell you that uh
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know the speaker asked me if i
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to give up
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
my responsibility on division two and i
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
said no i have too much fun there so
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
and besides mickey would be lonely
 
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
if uh if i wasn't annoying him every day
 
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
if uh if i wasn't annoying him every day
so

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the first thing we're going to um
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.789 align:start position:0%
i believe you've seen the amendment

i have okay i also have an uh and some
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
additional information based on the
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
comments of the group last session yeah
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%

great so thank you so much for having me
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
here again we really appreciate the
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
discussion at the last work session all
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
of these questions bring up great
 
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
discussion back at our office how we can
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
des wholeheartedly agrees with the
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
comments that i was hearing from this
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
group during the last work session that
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
econ's situation is difficult and unique
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
and warrants flexibility beyond what
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
we've been finding in the rules and in
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
and for that reason we've been working
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
with econ for a number of months to
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
find a way to achieve that flexibility
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's needed
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's important that des stay within its
 
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
it's important that des stay within its
authority

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
as we do this and it's important that
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
whatever agreement we come to is
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
documented in writing and signed off on
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
by both econ and des so in the future
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is no confusion about what the
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
agreement was
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
and based on our discussions with the
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
department of justice the vehicle that's
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
available to us to come to that written
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
agreement in an organized way is an
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
administrative order by consent
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
when i was here last time i wasn't sure
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
how much i could talk about about that
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
because we're in negotiations right now
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
on that but in speaking with doj they
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
told me it's fine to talk about it here
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
within certain limits because the
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
administrative order by consent has been
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussed also at a public meeting of
 
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.629 align:start position:0%
discussed also at a public meeting of
econ

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
econ
 
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.309 align:start position:0%
econ
so

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
based on the advice from doj i can't
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
share the details of the negotiations or
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
the details of what that agreement will
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
have in it
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm very glad to let the committee
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
know that we're working with econ
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
on an agreement with the goal of
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
providing econ with flexibility and
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
reliefs in the short term
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
assure compliance in the future and to
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
be sure that the landfill doesn't become
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
a financial burden on the citizens of
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
in order to move forward with those
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations that began in august we
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
needed the updated post-closure cost
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
estimate from econ and we received that
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
just after the last work session
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
our engineers are currently talking with
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
econs engineers they had a discussion
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
along the lines of us trying to gain an
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of where some of the
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
numbers in the estimate come from
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we were on course to come to an
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
agreement with econ
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any of your
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions about that and any other
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
plug me am i i am um so does that mean
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
we don't need this bill
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we can go forward we can itl this
 
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
and we can go forward we can itl this
bill

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh well we think that we can come to
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh the very needed flexible agreement um
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
that econ needs that will suit both the
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
state's needs and econs it just
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
if i may go ahead please um
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
i would always prefer not to put into
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislation something related to one
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
specific event
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
so it seems that this bill is
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary if in fact you have employed
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
measures within your agency
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
within the guidelines that allow for
 
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
within the guidelines that allow for
this

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050 align:start position:0%
madam speaker i mean
 
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.230 align:start position:0%

of the details
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
actually i don't understand why you
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%

heath was saying and what we have to do
 
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.710 align:start position:0%
heath was saying and what we have to do
here

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have to ask what level of trust do we
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
have that you will come to an agreement
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about you're in the
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
process of doing this
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
what assurance is that's a good word
 
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.710 align:start position:0%
what assurance is that's a good word
here

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
do we have that you will reach this
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
without having to go through a
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
legislative process and again i don't
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
mean any disrespect but i just need to
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
ask the question about how
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
can you assure us that this will be done
 
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
can you assure us that this will be done
sure

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
well it's something that we are actively
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
working on
um

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
as i think was pointed out in
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
in the last work session
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
and as econ has pointed out many times
 
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
and as econ has pointed out many times
one

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
option that that econ has has explained
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
that they have is to dissolve and to no
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
longer provide the support for this
 
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
longer provide the support for this
landfill

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
that is not something that anyone wants
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
to see happen it's not something we want
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
to see happen at des
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
because of the financial liability that
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
that would bring on to the state
 
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
that would bring on to the state
um

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing that in order to come to
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
agreement both both sides have to agree
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we're on track to do that
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have the details of the agreement to
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
work out
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
regarding why i can't talk about the
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
details of the negotiations it's
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
technically enforcement negotiations
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
with the attorneys on both sides
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
involved so those discussions are
 
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
involved so those discussions are
confidential

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
i wish i could share
 
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
i wish i could share
[Music]

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
so i hope that that answers your
 
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
so i hope that that answers your
question

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
when it's done will we get an update of
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
what that agreement looks like or is
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
that confidential too
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
the agreement when it is in place
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that it would be
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
confidential that wouldn't be normal i
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
suppose econ could ask for that but
 
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
suppose econ could ask for that but
i'm

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
i can't think of why they would so it
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
are there are there any other questions
 
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.150 align:start position:0%
are there are there any other questions
yeah

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
oh thank you chair thank you for taking
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
now you said that the state would be
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
responsible wouldn't the responsibility
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
let's say econ goes out of business
 
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
let's say econ goes out of business
would

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
would
the

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
liability go back to the 27
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know that put that waste there
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
i mean you know i know there's an
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
agreement between econ but
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know it seems so the state shouldn't
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
be i mean it's it's it's going to be
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a fight but right
 
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a fight but right
um

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we would need for our attorneys to
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
look at that there is this agreement
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
between those communities and econ that
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
was put in place when econ became um the
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
owner of the landfill
 
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.509 align:start position:0%
owner of the landfill
um

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
it could take a long time to work that
 
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
it could take a long time to work that
out

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the interim there would still need to
 
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.630 align:start position:0%
in the interim there would still need to
be

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
care taken of the landfill
 
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
care taken of the landfill
and

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
when no one else is stepping up
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
when there is environmental risk
 
00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
when there is environmental risk
presented

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
leachate that needs to be disposed of
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.069 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
then

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
if no one else is doing it then the
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
i guess that
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
my thought process is at this point
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
that if you follow through
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.509 align:start position:0%
on this
um

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
then there's no need for this bill is
 
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
then there's no need for this bill is
that

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
is that how people
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.829 align:start position:0%
is that how people
feel

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
okay okay
um

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.870 align:start position:0%
um
our

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.210 align:start position:0%
we will need
 
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
we will need
[Music]

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
because if
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
know all you have to tell us is there's
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go into details
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
you just have to say we've made the
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
agreement right i mean
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that agreeable
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we will have an
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
agreement in place by the eighth i
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't say you needed to have
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
the agreement
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
the two parties have to agree as to
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
what is going to go into the agreement
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm asking
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
given the availability of the parties
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
involved including our attorney i'm not
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
because today's the first that's one
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
week from today right
 
00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.230 align:start position:0%
week from today right
right

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
because there are a number of people who
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
are are out on vacation because it's
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
school vacation week right now tell them
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know could i just ask i mean one of
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
the things um
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
arguably what and i don't i mean i don't
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
know what how everyone else feels but
 
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.629 align:start position:0%
know what how everyone else feels but
arguably

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
arguably
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
it might be satisfactory if
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
i would think that the problem would be
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know at the worst case scenario
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
somehow you don't arrive at an agreement
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
and i guess the
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
um if we if we had if we took a vote
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
today let's say to to
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
render this building in expedient to
 
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.189 align:start position:0%
render this building in expedient to
legislate

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:40.230 align:start position:0%
legislate
um

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
then you didn't come to an agreement
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
obviously that could i mean that could
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
be a problem uh and so i guess what i'm
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering is
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
because because then we couldn't do
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
anything until the next legislative
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
session and so i guess the the only
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
question would be let's assume you
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
didn't come to an agreement what's the
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the state would and then
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
institute some enforcement action
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not really
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
able to speak on behalf of the
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner about how likely he is to
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
institute enforcement um but
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
our efforts have really been focused on
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
negotiating a settlement that
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
serves both parties needs
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead sorry madam chair thank you
 
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead sorry madam chair thank you
um

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
madam speaker i like i do like that
 
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
madam speaker i like i do like that
thing

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.829 align:start position:0%
thing
um

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
would it be possible just to interim
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
study this and then that would give us
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
the tools with which to work if we need
 
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.509 align:start position:0%
the tools with which to work if we need
to

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
i mean i would prefer just to be done
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
with this if possible
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
and not have to entertain it again um
 
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.749 align:start position:0%
and not have to entertain it again um
but

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
in light of the uncertainty
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we just need to hold on to it a
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
little bit longer
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we can always act on it at any
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
point right
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
let me ask janet
 
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.189 align:start position:0%
let me ask janet
okay

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i'd like to be done with it thank
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
you for so would i
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
i might be able to help on this as far
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
as the date so the last day to report
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
house bills is march 24th
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes so i think if you did an interim
 
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.110 align:start position:0%
yes so i think if you did an interim
study

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
you'd still be subject to that i don't
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
think you could take it out of interim
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
study after your report deadline of
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
house bills
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay so i could skip the 10th deadline
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah if you didn't if you say say we
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
took this off of exec session for the
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
eighth i think we've got until um
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess this could be a question
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
the the tenth deadline was bill's um not
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a second committee i'm not sure if
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
that applies to this bill because he's
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
not subject to a second committee but
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
the last day to report all house bills
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
is the 24th of march
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if this bill will be
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
what is the deadline for this bill
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think an interim study would
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
help in that deadline
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
if yeah if if you reported it you
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
change that or pass that bill this
 
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
change that or pass that bill this
session

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me i should probably talk so
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on is
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
des and the parties are pretty close to
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.470 align:start position:0%
an agreement
okay

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
but they don't think that
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
they will have the head nods
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay so the result is
 
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
okay so the result is
that

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
we we were thinking about itlling it if
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
they could get back to us by the eighth
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
which they don't think they can do
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted some sort of
 
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.029 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted some sort of
way

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
kill it
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
after the
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
once once we get them to
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.710 align:start position:0%
yeah so
okay

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question or two questions
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure what's the second committee and the
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
second question is if we pass this with
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment you know sometimes we'll
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
pass something
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know just in just in case um and the
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
agreement goes through can we when it
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
goes to the full house ask the house to
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
itl it because it's already been
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
considered we can do that and what one
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
what's the second committee is it going
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
to and no it's not going to assume so
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's not a second committee but the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
deadline's still the 10th right
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's for all bills
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
that are in our possession
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
that are not second committee bills
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am chair because we do not intend
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
to give them 500 000
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely so that's our job
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
so maybe
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
with that consideration we know we're
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
not going to give them money
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and we're not a policy committee
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's just a matter of saying no
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
we are
because

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
because it affects the money
 
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
because it affects the money
okay

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
can i make one other suggestion i don't
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
know whether this oh sure that makes
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
sense or not but what
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
could we i i did not want this dilemma
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
recommend that as ought to pass
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
and then if they do come to an agreement
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
ask on the floor that it be tabled or
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
itl or ito what is it one of them we'd
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
like to yell it right i'm not i'm not a
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
big favor of tabling by the way in case
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
anybody wanted to know
 
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
anybody wanted to know
so

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
that would probably let's say we're
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
meeting the
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're meeting the 10th
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
and then the following week
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we're meeting both
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
wednesday and thursday
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
that depends on
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
what we have so
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
how about another week
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's possible
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
where i understand we are is we have had
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
a discussion between engineers
 
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
a discussion between engineers
um

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
talked about get them providing some
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
the timeline for for when that
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
information would be provided is a
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
little bit out of our hands
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
so it's possible but i can't commit to
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
one more question man of chance listen
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
lots of questions no problem tom did you
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
i it's not it sounds as though um they
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
need some incentive to to
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
get this
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
get this agreement
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
under in in in our time frame
 
00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:52.549 align:start position:0%
under in in in our time frame
um

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
so can't we just say well you know
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
if if if it's not prepared by next week
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to itl this bill or we're
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
mike in in at our last meeting um we
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
said we wanted to go back and look at
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i think um we saw that
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative mari did do that
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we identified the fact that those
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
and we identified the fact that those
rules

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
were put in place
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
after the newport agreement had been
 
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
after the newport agreement had been
established

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
established
therefore

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be even doing this dance
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
this should be
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
something that i believe why do they
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
need to be held to that and they have
 
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.669 align:start position:0%
need to be held to that and they have
funding

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
to keep the landfill
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
what what they don't have is 500 000
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
yeah what they don't have is the 500
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
000. but they can't be held to that
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
level of funding i thought
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
at this point they can because right
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
des interpretation
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
of of what they needed
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
even after they had a signed agreement
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
with all the towns
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
agreeing to the closure
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the guidelines thereof
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
everybody signed off on it
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the des signed off on it and then
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
another set of rules were
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
established afterwards that all of a
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
sudden became applicable to that
 
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
sudden became applicable to that
situation

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's how i understand it
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
that that's why
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
how about we do this
 
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.750 align:start position:0%
how about we do this
okay

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
i like the idea
 
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
i like the idea
of

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
adopting the amendment
 
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.230 align:start position:0%
adopting the amendment
and

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
if they're able to get back to us prior
 
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.190 align:start position:0%
if they're able to get back to us prior
to

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
whatever day it's coming up in the
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
they let us know
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
what if they've come to an agreement
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
we will recommend itel
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question just following up
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
on that because we have the session on
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
the 10th
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
proposed sessions on the 16th the 17th
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.110 align:start position:0%
and the
31st

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
31st
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
do you have discretion about when you
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
can ask the speaker to put something on
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
i can try because that gives them maybe
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time and you know our
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to itl it
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
and once we have confidence in the
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
agreement then we can have that get on
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
the calendar fry tail so if we can push
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
that if it's possible to push that back
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
it gives them a little more both of them
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
a little more breathing space
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i would like to hear that icon as
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i make one more comment and this
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is really
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for this i mean i think
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
this i i think on the merits i really
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
like this amendment i think it you know
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
it makes
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
my only concern is i thought about this
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
just a little bit further which kind of
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
goes against what i said earlier is this
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
the parties are now in the process of
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
negotiating with each other presumably
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
each side has their you know what they
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
as i understand this amendment if we
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
we are essentially i think saying that
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said which may be you
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
know my inclination is you're absolutely
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
right we are essential we would
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
essentially be saying that our position
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
at least on this committee is that all
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
econ has to do is kind of comply with
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
what it originally agreed to
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
if we pass this
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
that could affect the negotiations
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
because econ may say why you know why
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
should i why should i agree to anything
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
else i've got the legislature on record
 
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
else i've got the legislature on record
saying

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
and and so that's my only concern we we
 
00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:06.390 align:start position:0%
and and so that's my only concern we we
are

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
by taking that action we may be
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
influencing their negotiation okay
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
then how about this
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
i like uh
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of interim study
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the negotiations to go on
 
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.870 align:start position:0%
the negotiations to go on
um

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
we've denied the
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll see what happens
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
but i you know i do think that uh
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
des and econ are
 
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.389 align:start position:0%
des and econ are
in

00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%

within the
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%

we had a discussion with d.o.e
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
and there is a
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
a way is that the right term
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
a way
 
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
a way
to

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
the department of department of
 
00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.550 align:start position:0%
the department of department of
agriculture

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
agree that we can use
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid data
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch
 
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.710 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch
okay

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's the non-germane amendment
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know we i hope that uh
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
the bill that it's attached to is the um
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
establishment of a position in doe
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
to monitor the efas so
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
i felt that that was something that
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
we could all support
 
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
we could all support
and

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
chose this particular bill to put it on
 
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
chose this particular bill to put it on
but

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm really really excited that uh
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
doe has been able to uh to do that and
 
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.670 align:start position:0%
doe has been able to uh to do that and
basically

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
they asked us if we would put
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that they had to do it
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.430 align:start position:0%
legislation that they had to do it
so

00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm easy yes
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair this is
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
something that i know when i was at the
 
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
something that i know when i was at the
department

00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
we always lost so many children who we
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
knew were eligible for these dollars but
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
because for whatever reason the parents
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get the paperwork or they didn't
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable doing the paperwork
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
this will make a difference for for
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
food insecurity um to help so many
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
children so thank you very much i think
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
it'll make a big difference based on the
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that the deal we give us
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and i you know um
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
there will still have to be the forms
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
filled out
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
income

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know falls into that but they do
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
have health insurance so
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
those those forms would still come in
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
but this is to me
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
just a just a wonderful thing to occur
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
and of course it's going to
 
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.670 align:start position:0%
and of course it's going to
perhaps

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
have some
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
financial impact in the future but
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
until we until we know what we know
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna worry about that
 
00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:16.710 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna worry about that
okay

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's only half an hour that i
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
brought you in here
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
for for such a short thing but
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
we will um
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
we will press on
 
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
we will press on
and

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
i really think that d.o.e got the
 
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
i really think that d.o.e got the
message

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
we were not
 
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.430 align:start position:0%
we were not
happy

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
and so
they

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
decided that
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
they could do something different
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
can i ask one more question when we were
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the data there was one
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
other thing that we had
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
talked about was the um going back and
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
looking at information over time
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
and it appears that they said that they
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the authority to do some of
 
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
didn't have the authority to do some of
that

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
um did we did we provide them with that
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like when i was at the
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
department we used to look at
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
longitudinal data
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
but now
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
when we hit we're having our free
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch conversation
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed that they
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
said that they
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
weren't able to do that
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was a problem they don't have
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's that they can't do it
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
but because they didn't have the
 
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.230 align:start position:0%
but because they didn't have the
information

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
without 4c they should have the data
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
with with with their data system they
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
should have longitudinal data but not on
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
i don't you know they have what they
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
have in the infam
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right i i think that i think that
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
moving towards getting the information
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid that it will allow them to do a
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
because right now as you know everything
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
is by student number
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
and there's no
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
is there anything i'm forgetting i just
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
want i had these senate bills right
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:42.069 align:start position:0%

we'll
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think on both of those which
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
are in division three there's
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
work that still needs to be done but
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
i will i will say this
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.670 align:start position:0%

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
1677.
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
there have been so many changes from the
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh initial bill
 
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
uh initial bill
that

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost like
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
that bill doesn't exist anymore
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
how many times have we rewritten that
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
three two
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.190 align:start position:0%
three two
three

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.670 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so
anyhow

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's um i and i think it's overall a
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
much better bill
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
than what we started with and uh
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
so we'll see where that one goes but we
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
