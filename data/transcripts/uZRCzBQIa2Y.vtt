good morning
 
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
I uh before we get going I'd like to
 
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
mention that we will be having hearings
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
two days a week
 
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
for for as long as we can manage we the
 
00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
house will be meeting in session pretty
 
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
much every Thursday in February except
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the last week which is vacation week
 
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.330 align:start position:0%
for the last week which is vacation week
and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
next week we will be meeting on
 
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.930 align:start position:0%
next week we will be meeting on
Wednesday

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
and Thursday unless the speaker
 
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
schedules a session in which case it
 
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 align:start position:0%
will be on Friday sorry about that but
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's we've got a dozen early bills we
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
have to hear
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
face up to it and schedule the the
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
hearings as soon as possible
 
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to welcome representative
 
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
Dolan who has
 
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
been unable to attend our previous
 
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.830 align:start position:0%
been unable to attend our previous
meetings

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.210 align:start position:0%
meetings
and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
open the hearing for House Bill 355 and
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
call Representative Gallagher and if you
 
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
would put in a pink card representative
 
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
Galler or at after the end of your
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
Gallagher representing Merrimack County
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
District 20. which is conquered Ward 6.
 
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
um so I am here
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
355 establishing a committee to study
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
the sharing of data between state and
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.129 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
if you tend to
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
get in political debates often which
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
most of us as legislators I'm assuming
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
do one
 
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.150 align:start position:0%
do one
phrase

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
that you might hear
 
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
people say as well if you don't like it
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
then leave
 
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.909 align:start position:0%
then leave
so

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
the thing about that though is
 
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.550 align:start position:0%
the thing about that though is
that

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's actually
 
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 align:start position:0%
rather hard to do that for
 
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
certain people for for example those
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
living in public housing
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.129 align:start position:0%
so um
if

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
if someone in public housing
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
wants to move
 
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
they can't just
 
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.490 align:start position:0%
they can't just
transfer

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
their data
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
and and move they have to restart the
 
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
application process
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
from the beginning again
 
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.670 align:start position:0%
from the beginning again
and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.850 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
I actually put in
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
a research request
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
about this to OLS
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
they they did get back to me
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it was
 
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.409 align:start position:0%
um I think it was
um

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I got some responses from I think
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
it was Jack reuterman who
 
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.770 align:start position:0%
it was Jack reuterman who
um

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned about some of the ways that
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
data sharing already happens
 
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.070 align:start position:0%
data sharing already happens
um

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
between state and federal
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
housing agencies
 
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.050 align:start position:0%
housing agencies
um

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.210 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
yeah they they weren't able to turn
 
00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.050 align:start position:0%
yeah they they weren't able to turn
those

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
research results into
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
um an actual
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
Bill unfortunately so instead um it's
 
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
become a
 
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh study committee so we can find out
 
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
uh study committee so we can find out
um

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.189 align:start position:0%
um
more

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
details about how to turn it into
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
actual legislation
 
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
actual legislation
um

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think this would be
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
helpful for housing to help streamline
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
the application process
 
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.710 align:start position:0%
the application process
um

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
so that way
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
people can get
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
in more easily and uh
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
can do foot folding to live where
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
they want to and feel most comfortable
 
00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:36.589 align:start position:0%
they want to and feel most comfortable
um

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
and yeah because Concord for example the
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
Concord public housing the Concord
 
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority closed applications
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
just because there were
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
it was so far behind on them so um
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
I I think having some data portability
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
to uh
to

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
help reduce
 
00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:04.510 align:start position:0%
help reduce
the

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
retyping the same information every time
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
would help things go more smoothly so
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
that's why I've proposed this bill and
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
um so are you worried about data sharing
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
between different housing authorities
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire mainly
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
or is it Interstate what what do you get
 
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.389 align:start position:0%
or is it Interstate what what do you get
well

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
um both I I would like I I would like
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the study committee to look at both of
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.050 align:start position:0%
the study committee to look at both of
those

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
can you follow up follow-up so so there
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
is actually a problem between housing
 
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
authorities within the state they each
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
have their own system and everything is
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.769 align:start position:0%
that correct
um

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would like the site you create
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
who look at that as well
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
do you see any potential conflict in the
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
sharing the information with the feds uh
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
and our state privacy Amendment
 
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
and our state privacy Amendment
um

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
well as this is Sie committee um I I
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
think that is something that it could
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
figure out is if any such conflict
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
exists um I mean I I was thinking if we
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
do set up something like this that you
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
know the people
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
people could choose to take part in it
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.250 align:start position:0%
or not
um

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know just add another check box
 
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
you know just add another check box
and

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.449 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
but again that would be something for
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
the study committee too
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chair my question
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
is what kind of data gets
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
moved from the state level to the
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.710 align:start position:0%
well so
um

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.750 align:start position:0%
um
whether

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
you're receiving funding through HUD or
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
not so
 
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.210 align:start position:0%
not so
um

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.070 align:start position:0%
um
like

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
the Concord Housing Authority for
 
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
the Concord Housing Authority for
example

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's a local agency but it's also HUD
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
housing and then HUD is a federal agency
 
00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:44.899 align:start position:0%
and you have to do all these sorts of
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
redetermination paperworks to see if you
 
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
redetermination paperworks to see if you
qualify

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
for it or not
 
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.670 align:start position:0%
for it or not
um

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
so and yeah that goes to both the
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
concrete Housing Authority
 
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.730 align:start position:0%
concrete Housing Authority
and

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
to the federal government uh for
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
determining uh
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
for HUD purposes so
 
00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:08.569 align:start position:0%
for HUD purposes so
um

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
this would help clarify who gets what
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
from that process
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you follow on follow-up follow-up
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
you stated that this is a local plus
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
estate plus a federal who would share
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
the tax burden of sharing data
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially if software systems are
 
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
especially if software systems are
separate

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.449 align:start position:0%
separate
um

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
well yes asset study committee um that
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
would be within the domain of things for
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
the study committee to
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
um yeah you know that's why
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
it is just a study committee is because
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
we we don't have all those answers yet
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative you have a
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Gallagher
 
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.530 align:start position:0%
um representative Gallagher
um

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
what kind of
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
organizations you see
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
would testify before this committee
 
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.210 align:start position:0%
would testify before this committee
and

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
could they have been part of The
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
Originals I guess this is a question for
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
anyone at this table could a member of
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
one of those committees have been a
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um
 
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.410 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um
well

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking local housing
 
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.370 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking local housing
authorities

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.690 align:start position:0%
authorities
um

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.829 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's um
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's there's two separate
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
parts so there's members of the
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
committee and then who comes and
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
testifies before it so um yeah the
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
members are legislators
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
and then uh it says appointed by the
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
speaker so
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah he could pick them from this
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
committee and then for people who would
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
come and testify before it
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I would be thinking people from how
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
housing agencies like Concord housing
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:19.820 align:start position:0%
yeah when I asked OLS to do a research
 
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.710 align:start position:0%
yeah when I asked OLS to do a research
request

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.530 align:start position:0%
about this
um

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
the people that they
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.949 align:start position:0%
reached out to
um

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
so yeah I I
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
um I forget the exact exact Department
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that uh Jack ritterman is the head of
 
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
but um I can find that in my email and
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward that to all of you
 
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.730 align:start position:0%
forward that to all of you
um

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I it might um
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
then like the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority
 
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.050 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority
um

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.370 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
um like the one that Ben Frost is with
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and and also New Hampshire does have
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
its own HUD office
 
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.009 align:start position:0%
its own HUD office
um

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:05.329 align:start position:0%
um
in

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester I emailed them about this
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
but they seem to think I actually want
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with the New Hampshire
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority so there's a
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
there as well about whose responsibility
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
which pieces of data are
 
00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:24.350 align:start position:0%
which pieces of data are
um

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.850 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I would think that
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
they would come before the committee as
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459 align:start position:0%
are there when you were preparing your
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
testimony did you ask support from any
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
of these other organizations to come and
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
testify before the committee
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
um not to not to come and testify here
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
specifically mostly I just asked them
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
for information about
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
how the current system works
 
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.550 align:start position:0%
how the current system works
um

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.210 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah when
 
00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
it turned out that
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the current information that I got
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
from them wasn't enough then that's
 
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.230 align:start position:0%
from them wasn't enough then that's
um

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's when it turned into they study
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
committee to the TF play
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
maybe other members would have better
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions for them on how to
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
turn this
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%

Madam chair uh representative Gallagher
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh the way this uh
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
Poe's law is written up uh are you aware
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
of and are you okay with the fact that
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
this uh will sunset this coming November
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
that seems like a reasonable time frame
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
um were you thinking were you thinking
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's too short or too long no I just
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as a sponsor of
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you're you weren't
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think November 1st is a
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
reasonable due date but um if I
 
00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
reasonable due date but um if I
um

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah if this committee would like to
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
change it I would be open to that
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher did you seek
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
any co-sponsors on this bill or did you
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
ask co-sponsors and not not have any
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.370 align:start position:0%
yeah I
um

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
I don't think this was one of the bills
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that I saw co-sponsors on uh yeah I'm on
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills this term so it's it's
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
hard to keep some of them straight
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning

Ruderman I am with
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm with New Hampshire housing
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
um also known as New Hampshire Housing
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority I serve as the manager
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
for public affairs we were contacted by
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher and uh or
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
indirectly through
 
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:11.810 align:start position:0%
indirectly through
um

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services at some
 
00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:15.950 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services at some
point

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't really um
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
we don't really have a position on the
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
bill but two things that I wanted to
 
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.140 align:start position:0%
make cleared in the committee are
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
number one we're not a state agency and
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the conventional sense of the word
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
um were a state Authority so we're we're
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
quasi governmental
 
00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:41.059 align:start position:0%
um and secondly
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
we're not a public housing authority
 
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
we're not a public housing authority
um

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
so we um we help promote support and
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
finance uh affordable housing
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
development around the state
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
um but we don't actually serve as the
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
state's public housing authority or
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not in the same
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
league with let's say the Portsmouth
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority or the Concord Housing
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
Authority so I just wanted to to make
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
those clarifications but um you know I'm
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
certainly sympathetic to representative
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's concerns uh and I'm you know
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
we are not opposing
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
um this bill and
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that we can be helpful
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to to keep
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
um stay involved um should the committee
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
wish to establish the study Commission
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
are there questions right yes
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
hi can you tell me how many staff you
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
and do you
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
accumulate data
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
on housing issues homelessness
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes we do and we do manage the state's
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
housing Choice voucher program or
 
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:16.820 align:start position:0%
Section 8 program as it's commonly known
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
so we have we have data on the folks who
 
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:22.700 align:start position:0%
are participants in that program
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
but we don't have data you know if
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
someone said
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
um could you please take a look at
 
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:33.620 align:start position:0%
resident X's data because we want to
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
share that data with another Authority
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative O'Brien
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam Sharon thank you Mr
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
rutterman for taking my question uh I
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
understand your uh New Hampshire housing
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
has no position on it and I don't mean
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
but the thing is in looking at this did
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
was it ever a discussion of a
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
cost-benefit analysis do you see a need
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
for this you know or is it you know I
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
just don't want to create another level
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
of bureaucracy if not needed so if you
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
can I know you put in a position of
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
Noah pen you know no position but could
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
you explain further
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
because we're not a housing authority
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm really not I'm not trying to
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
dodge your question but because we're
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
not a housing authority and we don't
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
have that data
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what it would take
 
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:43.700 align:start position:0%
um to actually make that data
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
transportable but
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
um if there is to be a study uh
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee then I think the folks who
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
manage you know the the six or seven
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
Regional public housing authorities in
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
the state could could speak to that and
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I just don't know whether
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's a simple thing to do with an
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
application to upload it from one agency
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
to another or whether it would be
 
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.890 align:start position:0%
to another or whether it would be
complicated

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%

Stratford County delegation okay so we
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
we had a situation several years ago
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
where uh we also tried to streamline
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
things because one of the things that we
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
discovered and I'm sure you deal with
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
something similar to yourself somebody
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
comes in they have to go through all the
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
paperwork name address social security
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
number in some cases and so forth over
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
and over and over again this that it's
 
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:54.860 align:start position:0%
it's the same data for the individual
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere he or she goes right so the
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
idea that you have to repeat it over and
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
over again and that the agency also has
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
to uh have the the same stuff that some
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
other agency doing the same kind of work
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
would have would it not be a a
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
facilitation of
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
both sides to have data sharing
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
capability and and I'm sure to some
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
degree they're already doing it uh but
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
but that's the purpose of the study
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee as I see it is to is to save
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
this you go out of the you go in the
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
door of this institution you come back
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
out you go in another Silo come back out
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
you go on another Silo over and over
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
again for one thing and one of the
 
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:45.620 align:start position:0%
things we discovered was that it's very
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
psychologically innervating to have to
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
do that and it's also a waste of time I
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
believe so you're not taking a position
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
but you do see that this would the study
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
of the data sharing could be useful
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much other
 
00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:06.529 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much other
questions

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you Mr
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%

all right seeing none I will close the
 
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:22.430 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
hearing

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
if you want to open up the executive
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
session I'll be I'd like to present the
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee with a motion
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
all right without objection we'll go
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
into executive session
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative broader thank you I'm
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
going to recommend itl for house bill
 
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.370 align:start position:0%
going to recommend itl for house bill
355.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
355.
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative true was first that I saw
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
at least okay do you want to speak to
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
I would thank you
 
00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:52.909 align:start position:0%
I would thank you
um

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
Jeremy McGuire
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
although I see
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
that this is an interesting
 
00:25:02.649 --> 00:25:02.659 align:start position:0%
topic and needed information
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we have an affordable housing
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and it seems to me that
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
there are so many independent
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that would be involved
 
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:18.620 align:start position:0%
with this and it would be a voluntary
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
program ultimately
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
I I think that the study commission is
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
premature and I also don't think that
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
the November deadline would be adequate
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
considering the effort that would it
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
would take to get this done that's my
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
concern with the bill and um I don't
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
necessarily like to
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
um present motions prematurely but I
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
think that in this case
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative true do you
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second no all
 
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.390 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second no all
right

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.409 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just double checking I thought it
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%

the vote to 18-0
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh right between the motion to 18 to
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
zero the motion passes
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%

00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
the Des and DHHS have an updated
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreement on cooperation
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
regarding data sharing between the
 
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.789 align:start position:0%
regarding data sharing between the
agencies

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
a joint standard operating procedure on
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
how data layers can be shared between
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
the two departments must be in place to
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
enable the agencies to collaboratively
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
identify linkage linkages between
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants and health
 
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.750 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants and health
outcomes

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
and a semi-annual report shall be
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
submitted regarding the data sharing
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
practices required under the statute to
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Speaker of the House the Senate
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
President the State library and the
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
commission to study environmentally
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
triggered chronic illness I think it's
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
important to note here that when we
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
reference the sharing of Health Data the
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
statute specifically states that only
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
non-protected health information or
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
aggregate aggregated data shall be made
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
available where it is pertinent to the
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
matter being addressed there's no
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
requirement to disclose confidential or
 
00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:54.379 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise protected by state or federal
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
law HIPAA compliance is prioritized by
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
the agency and personal privacy remains
 
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.230 align:start position:0%
the agency and personal privacy remains
protected

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
HB 391 is meant to First clarify the
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
ongoing nature of the memorandum of
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
agreement between Des and DHHS regarding
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
data sharing practices
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
to ensure that an agreement remains in
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
effect without lapse HB 391 aims to
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
ensure that a memorandum of agreement
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
between DHHS and Des remain current and
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
in place as is required by Statute
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that due to an
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
oversight the memorandum of agreement
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
between the agencies actually lapsed in
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
June of 2022 possibly due to some
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
administrative procedural terminology
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
changes relative to moas and mous that
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
may have delayed things since this LSR
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
has been filed I've been informed that
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
it is an effort is actively underway to
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
update that agreement
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
I know that some of the agency
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
Representatives I've been working with
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
are here who can speak a bit more about
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the one
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
one of the proposed agency mou versus Mo
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh a terminology changes that have come
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
up in discussion in reference to the
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
current Statute in hb39 and I'll leave
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
that to them
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
HB 391 is also meant to reduce the
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
semi-annual reporting requirements to an
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
annual one this came as a request of
 
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.690 align:start position:0%
annual one this came as a request of
DHHS

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
it will also delete reference to and
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement for reporting on
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
the arsenic in drinking water two-way
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
pilot project as that pilot project is
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
no longer in existence
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
and finally it will add the commission
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
on the environmental and public health
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
impacts of per and polyfluoroacal
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
substances to the entities that will
 
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:42.980 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of the annual report
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
referencing the environmental and Health
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
Data sharing practices required under
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state RSA
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
given the environmental and public
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
health challenges New Hampshire
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
currently faces there's no question that
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
ongoing collaboration and data sharing
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
between the agencies is both necessary
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
and appropriate to properly address the
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
relationship between the environment and
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
though concerns about Arsenic and other
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
contaminants may have precipitated HB
 
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:11.660 align:start position:0%
1356 in 2018
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about environmental
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
contaminants like pfas and our air soil
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
and drinking water
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
lead in our homes and the pipes and
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
Faucets in our schools Etc and the
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
impact of all of these things on public
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
health deserve our attention today
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
data collection and sharing provides our
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
state agency's key environmental and
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
health information that drives decision
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
making and has the ability to positively
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
impact the health and well-being of New
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens I'm happy to take
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
questions and know that the a Regency
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
Representatives I've been working with
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%

HB 391
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
um after based on some of the
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
discussions with DHHS and Des if the
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
committee determines
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
um after agency input that amendment to
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
certain language might be best and
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
wishes for me to provide an amendment
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to to request one thank you
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Schmidt you have a
 
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.890 align:start position:0%
um representative Schmidt you have a
question

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
I notice there's no fiscal note uh I'm a
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
little bit surprised uh because it seems
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
like there would be some cost uh for
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
something which is going to go forward
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
and not lapse
 
00:38:33.609 --> 00:38:33.619 align:start position:0%
so is this something that you are
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about that there is no fiscal
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
note no no there's there's
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
um in statute right now there's a
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
requirement that that agreement be in
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
place it just this bill would just
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
require that it not laps so it's not
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not there's no fiscal note
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
because it's it's actually already in
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
place it just needs to be updated it's a
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
matter and and I I know
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
um maybe Des will speak to the where
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
they're at in that process already
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you've considered that I'm okay with
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you thank you any other
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative O'Brien thank
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
could you just briefly go over I'm from
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
Nashua and uh quite familiar with what's
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
going on with Merrimack as you know we
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
have the public national public water
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
supply is the pentacha cooperation and
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are watching that could you just
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
briefly explain to this committee why is
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is so important as
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
far as the reporting and everything else
 
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:41.180 align:start position:0%
that will come out of it because of uh
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
Saint-Germain and everything
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for your question
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
um this this uh data sharing agreement
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
was put in place
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
right back in 2018 and I know at that
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
time pfest was already a concern um it
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
had been discovered uh in the Merrimack
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
area in 2016 in our public drinking
 
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.510 align:start position:0%
area in 2016 in our public drinking
water

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
um and it remains problematic for for
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
our community as well as the concern
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
about the health impacts related to our
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
long-term and ongoing exposure
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
the the agencies because of the overlap
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
in the concerns whether they're the

impact of environmental contaminants on
 
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.010 align:start position:0%
impact of environmental contaminants on
health

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
um must work together and collaborate
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
and they do and they do a great job of
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
that and we want to ensure that that
 
00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:31.670 align:start position:0%
that and we want to ensure that that
continues

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
um the the specifics and actually in
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
those reports you'll see some examples
 
00:40:38.099 --> 00:40:39.410 align:start position:0%
those reports you'll see some examples
of

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
um updates from the agencies relative to
 
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:46.579 align:start position:0%
the issues that are being addressed
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
collaboratively by the agencies and the
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
biomonitoring program is mentioned in
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
there and I I know you know there are
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
people in in the Merrimack area that
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
have been included as subjects and that
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh in that in that project as well as a
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
number of others the Merrimack cancer
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
investigation is included as well
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I know recently there was
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
another actually last December on
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
December 10th there was an Announcement
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
by DHHS that the town of Merrimack
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
has a a increased risk of kidney and
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
renal pelvis cancers
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
that at this point we certainly can't
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
aren't saying is related to
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
um to uh it's caused by p-fest but
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
kidney and renal pelvis cancers are
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
known to be associated with pfas and
 
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.329 align:start position:0%
known to be associated with pfas and
where

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:44.300 align:start position:0%
um you know we're pretty impacted by by
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
the emissions from from Saint Cobain so
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh pfest is one of those issues and you
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
know there are almost 30 000 people in
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and um
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a a uh a health concern
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
around that particular environmental uh
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
contaminant and that was actually one of
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
the reasons for the request that the
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
report go to the new ham the pfest
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
commission the HB 737pfest commission as
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
well because much of our work the SB 85
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
commission environmentally triggered
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
chronic illness and HB 737 pfest
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
commission we do a lot of parallel work
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of overlap so
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question thank
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
you it did for every answer thank you
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair I yield
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh excuse me representative
 
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh excuse me representative
Dolan

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
Dolan
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
one thing that I'm glad you're looking
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
into the the pfas issue that's the uh
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
the more the publicity the publicity
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
around that issue is uh heightened but
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
my question is it looks like you've
 
00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:53.870 align:start position:0%
my question is it looks like you've
struck

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
the language around arsenic uh and so
 
00:42:59.650 --> 00:42:59.660 align:start position:0%
forth and and we know that
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
pfas is
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
caused by pollutants where arsenic is
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
mostly naturally occurring
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
but it's also
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest health hazard in
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
We Know It causes learning disabilities
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth and young children are you
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
concerned at all that that the way the
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
language is coming out of this uh this
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill that we should be only caring about
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
pfas and no longer Cure by arsenic thank
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
you for your question no not at all
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
because arsenic LED we have a number of
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
environmental triggers of chronic
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
illness that we should be concerned
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
about the only reason to strike that
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
language is because that language in
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
statute currently is specific to a pilot
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
project regarding Arsenic and drinking
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
water that is no longer in effect so the
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
pilot project itself no longer exists so
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
that's the rationale for removing that
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
language although
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure the the agencies will tell
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
you that arsenic is certainly one of
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
those things that they continue as to to
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
Monitor and report on arsenic lead and
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
all those other issues so it's not
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
um it's not that the um that this bill
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
would remove study of that or
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
collaboration around those concerns it's
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
just specific to a a project that is no
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
longer in existence
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:41.569 align:start position:0%
 
yes

bureau chief
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we are here to provide some
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
information related to HB 391 we had
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
spoken with the sponsor representative
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
Murphy on this bill I just wanted to be
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
clear that we are not taking a position
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
but I'd be happy to answer some
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
questions and provide information on the
 
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:39.410 align:start position:0%
questions and provide information on the
language

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:41.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's bill
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
um moves from six months to a year
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
is that a satisfactory or is it timely
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
would six months get you a better jump
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
on the issue
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have any concerns
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the changing of the reporting
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
requirement in terms of frequency or
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
also including the additional commission
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack pfas commission as well so
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
we're amenable to those changes
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor of the bill
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that there had been a
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
lapse in this
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
study and this communication can you
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
explain why that happened and how this
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
bill Rectify that right so
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the labs it was just
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
an inadvertent lapse of of not renewing
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
the Moa I do want to just inform the
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee that the department does not
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
think that it's necessary actually to be
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
codified in a statute to have this MLA
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
codified in statute because it is our
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
common practice to do this work anyways
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
so our data our aggregated data is on
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
our website and so anyone has access
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
including the Department of
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and the
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
Departments are committed to working
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
together to provide any technical
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
assistance or guidance around the
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
agency's public data so
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
although there was a lapse it did not
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
the absence of an existing MOA did not
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
prevent the Department's either
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
Department from working together and
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
sharing the aggregated data so I just
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
want to and just inform the committee
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
that although the the mou did lapse
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
inadvertently it was it did not impact
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
the ability for the agencies to work
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
together or share data follow-up
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up so although there was a lapse
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the agreement the the actual data was
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
still collected and shared right it's
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
publicly publicly available data both
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
agencies have publicly available data
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I will also just inform for any data
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is has protected health information
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
and this is particular to the Department
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services any data
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we share that is protected health
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
information that would need a specific
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
data sharing agreement because we are a
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
HIPAA compliant agency and so this
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
overarching mou or MOA would not allow
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
us to share that the the protected
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
health information we would need an
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
additional specific data sharing
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
agreement to share that data and it's
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
all about making sure that we're
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
protecting privacy because it does have
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
protected health and it would have
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
protected health information and and
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
those data sharing Agreements are
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
established by project and by by data
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
set needed so we would want to make sure
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
we understood you know why an agency or
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
an entity would be requesting that data
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
what they would be doing with it how
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
they would be using that data so that's
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
all part of the requirements as being a
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
HIPAA compliant agency that we need to
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that that data is protected
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
before sharing it but this data shared
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
with with between HHS and Des does not
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
contain individual health data correct
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the data that the mou
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
or MOA is referring to is aggregated
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
data that is not protected health
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
information and is publicly available
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
you could go on the DHHS data portal
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
currently and see the data that's
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
available in aggregated form thank you
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so given that
 
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:31.910 align:start position:0%
thank you so given that
um

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
I mean is there any point to anything in
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
126-a76 other than maybe D Roman 3
 
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:41.660 align:start position:0%
requiring a report
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
I mean do you need this to do what
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
no we currently don't the mo the Moa or
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
mou does not you know as I said doesn't
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
prevent us from doing what we're
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
currently doing in practice
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
the language and the latter part of the
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill under three the department is
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
amenable to modifying the report
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
frequency to being one year and then
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
sharing that report with the other
 
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.650 align:start position:0%
sharing that report with the other
Commission

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:08.660 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess my point is
 
00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:12.290 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess my point is
um

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know if we eliminated the whole
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
thing other than maybe uh Roman 3
 
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
um as the the requirement for the data
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
sharing um and 126a 76 came from uh work
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the commission on environment
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
illness from SB 80 I guess it was his SP
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
85 currently as we know at the
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
commission um it was put in effect back
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
in 2018 we don't have a problem with
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
having that in statute the issue I think
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to bring to the
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
community's attention is that in
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's language we
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
understand that because there was a
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
lapse in the agreement you know the
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
typically the and we have shared that
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
the information continuously was shared
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
even though the document lapsed that our
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
understanding in working at the new mou
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
um with the Department of Environmental
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
Services which should be completed
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
shortly is that mousse cannot be
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
designated in a non-lap status so they
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
do have to have an end date and they do
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
have to be reviewed so the only issue
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to bring up you know for
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
the Committees the Do Not lapse language
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't go with what our legal advice
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
had been on from our legal department
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
related to mou's needing to have an end
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
date quick quick follow-up yeah I'm
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
looking for a yes or no answer and that
 
00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:31.849 align:start position:0%
looking for a yes or no answer and that
is

00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
if we got rid of this 126 a76
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
would you have to change anything you do
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
other maybe the reporting things do you
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
need any Authority in here to do what
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing that's kind of yes or no
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
I think the answer would be no to that I
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
can just say that the SB 85 commission
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
looks forward to our report we would
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
continue to do it and it's just keeping
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know the reporting requirement in
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
place it just you know gives the gives
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
the agencies uh you know a reference
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
point to when the reporting is due due
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
to the previous statute okay thank you
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
welcome all right thank you
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning Abby
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
good morning nice to see you and
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
Michelle as well of course I just don't
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
know quite as well so uh one of the
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that those of us who've been on
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
the committee for a while are well aware
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
of is that this situation that
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy is especially
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
concerned about naming Merrimack is not
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
limited of course to Merrimack it's uh
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
the the the chemicals of p5s and so
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
forth that have spread Beyond Merrimack
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
and they are uh in in other surrounding
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
communities as well I believe uh Madbury
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
medals in Dover also has an occurrence
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
of uh pfas and other related chemicals
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
so uh the remarks you made with regard
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the ongoing
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring and study and so forth that
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
applies Statewide if you will in terms
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the monitoring you do it's not just
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
limited to this subject of
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
if I may ask a clarifying question when
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
you refer to monitoring can you can you
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little bit are you
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
talking about monitoring of water
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
quality or what is the okay well I'm
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
especially concerned about pfas we as
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
you probably recall there was a a rule
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
that came to the jail car about
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think about two years ago the pandemic
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
kind of distorts my recollection of time
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
but a couple of years ago representative
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
McGuire probably remembers as well uh a
 
00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:44.300 align:start position:0%
rule that was going to require
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
communities to test their water
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
to see if they had uh pifas in their
 
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
to see if they had uh pifas in their
water

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:54.859 align:start position:0%
that's a relatively inexpensive
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
operation to do the test uh if there's
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
pedophiles are found or any of the
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
analogous chemicals then then
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
remediation would be a a totally
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
different issue in terms of cost but uh
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
so that that was a requirement and the
 
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:15.380 align:start position:0%
rule was adopted went into effect
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
and so my question is whether the this
 
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
that that was a form of monitoring but
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
whether the department is also
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
continuing to
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
use use some other word than monitoring
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
can continuing to stay in touch with the
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
development because the contamination
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
process is ongoing hasn't been stopped
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
and it's just remediation it continues
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
so what is the department doing if if
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
this if this study is not if this bill
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
is not adopted you said that wouldn't
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
have any impact on what you're doing and
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm asking whether you are in touch with
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
the situation wherever pfas has been
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
found in the state of New Hampshire yes
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the Department of
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services for specific uh
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
you know responses relative to the
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
actual rules and or monitoring of the
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
pfas because that really falls under
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
their purview but I will say that the
 
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
Departments the two departments Health
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and Des works very
 
00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:20.420 align:start position:0%
closely on all environmental health
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
issues including pfas issues and
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
certainly the department uh Health and
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
Human Services would follow any
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations on uh like private well
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
water testing uh you know
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
recommendations on uh people to to to
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
test their well water to make sure that
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
they are aware of what may be in their
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
well water we we would follow those
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations and encourage any any
 
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
person on private well water to do well
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
water testing so hopefully that answers
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
your question I think some of your
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
question might be more relevant for Des
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that is helpful but I will pursue
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you thank you
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative brother
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
so for those of us where this is not as
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
obvious what data are you sharing like
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
what data does the Des share and what
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
data do you share where is what is the
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
data that you're sharing so the day so
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
Services has what we call our our DHHS
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
data portal and you can go on to that
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
well it's it's publicly available on our
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
website it includes data uh there's data
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
on childhood lead poisoning there's well
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
water there's a well water dashboard up
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
there there's climb some climate and
 
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:38.420 align:start position:0%
health there's
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
I I apologize I don't know all the data
 
00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:43.339 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but I certainly
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
it is publicly available on our on our
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
website and it's uh the repository for
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is known as DHHS data portal
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
follow up I guess because I'm sorry
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up because we're
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
talking about pfas what specific data
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
are you sharing about pfat I mean this
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
is what this is no no they're giving the
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
data they have on public health
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
chronic illness cancer I'm sure
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
to the commission that is working on
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
pfax and the commission on
 
00:57:17.819 --> 00:57:20.030 align:start position:0%
pfax and the commission on
um

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
public environmentally triggered chronic
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
illness so they're just giving this data
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
to the commission that's doing the study
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
so if that helps
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I misunderstood that that
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
makes more sense okay
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
sorry a representative goalie you had a
 
00:57:40.559 --> 00:57:43.250 align:start position:0%
sorry a representative goalie you had a
question

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
yes I think
 
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
yes I think
so

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the information that's
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
currently available online in your
 
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.250 align:start position:0%
currently available online in your
portal

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
that this memorandum understanding
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
allows you to transfer over to Des or is
 
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
there other information Des is giving to
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services that's in this
 
00:58:05.099 --> 00:58:09.109 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services that's in this
memorandum

00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie um I we
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
would defer a little bit to Karen Craver
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
who's here from Des on the Des
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
information but my understanding is all
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
of their information is publicly
 
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:21.020 align:start position:0%
available on their website
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
and uh we share uh collaboratively
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
information that would inform as
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said both the
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
work of the HB 737 commission and
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
network of the SB 85 commission looking
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
at Health impacts and uh related to
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
toxic chemicals so we do share
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
information between agencies we're asked
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
to do reporting to those commissions and
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we collaborate on those
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
reports to better inform the legislature
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
on what's happening with pfas and its
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
related Health impacts
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think the committee questions that
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to understand is this
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
specific to just Merrimack is it
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
specific to the entire State and what
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
deep down data if I go to your website
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
right now will I find will I find it by
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
address will I find it by
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
um is it is it just
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
for the entire town is it specific to a
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
geographic area
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
how are you tracking that so
 
00:59:31.329 --> 00:59:31.339 align:start position:0%
you're you're you have medical
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
diagnosis information
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
so all of the data that's available on
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
the DHHS website is aggregated so that
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're protect so that there is no
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
protected health information that's
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
provided on the website and it's the
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
data that and I wish I I wish I could
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
call it up right now because I could
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
speak to it a little bit better but this
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
data would not be considered a protected
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
health information so you won't you
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
won't find an address or you won't find
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know personally identifiable
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
information on our website it would be
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
aggregated uh by it I think that and and
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
I apologize that I don't know this off
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I think it might be
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
census tract at as as the lowest
 
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.809 align:start position:0%
census tract at as as the lowest
um

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I have to I'd have to go I
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
apologize I I would have to refer to the
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
actual data sets to look at that but
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
this is all public publicly available
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
data that
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
um you know the department can share
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
both with agencies and with other uh
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
interested parties as well and it is
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
available on our website
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
thank you follow on follow-up
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative a bear where your
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
questions are straying away from the
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill in question
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a specific Bill related
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
question I was just curious about the
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
first question I asked if it was just
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
Merrimack specific it is not Merrimack
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
specific else all the data if you glance
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
at the data that representative Murphy's
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
gave us they talk about
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
various environmental issues and public
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
health issues throughout the state it's
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
not Miramax acidic thank you for the
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to clarify that
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
the data that that we share informs a
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
commission HB 737 which focuses on
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
Merrimack in the surrounding area SB 85
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
is a studies chronically triggered
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
illness and the information that we
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
collect at DHHS and share with these
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
commissions is Statewide data but
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
specifically because the HB 737
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
commission covers Merrimack Litchfield
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and surrounding communities
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
we do focus on those communities for
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
that Commission because that's the focus
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
of the commission but but the
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
information the data shared in the
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
referenced here is Statewide data that
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
that um that is requested to from the
 
01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:05.210 align:start position:0%
that um that is requested to from the
Department

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.710 align:start position:0%
Department
okay

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
represent Gould
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
my question goes to the parameters of
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
shared data so the question is if this
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
information is available on your website
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
then Des can just go to your website and
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
get it but in your last statement it
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
sounded like no you tailored the data
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
for a specific commissions that's kind
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
of embedded in what this bill
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
impacts and my other my so a
 
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.329 align:start position:0%
impacts and my other my so a
relationship

01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
could you let them answer your first
 
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.230 align:start position:0%
could you let them answer your first
question

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.710 align:start position:0%
question
okay

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
so I I believe
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
um so I believe what you're asking is
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
the data that's on the website do we
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
have additional data that we inform the
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
commissions am I understanding that
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
correctly I didn't really phrase the
 
01:02:59.690 --> 01:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
question yet what is the question then
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question is is
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
the data sharing agreement simply a
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
piece of paper writing a report and
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
sharing it or are we talking about your
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
sharing data between systems and forming
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
a data set that that helps do something
 
01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
a data set that that helps do something
else

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
so in so I'll just speak in practice and
 
01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:23.579 align:start position:0%
practice the Departments work very
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
closely together on whatever issues that
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
may arise so they could be commission
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
related requests it could be or
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
commission related discussions
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
um it could be just working together on
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
other environmental health related
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
issues and we work pretty closely with
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
each other all the time regardless of
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
whether there is an mou in place it is
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
our common practice to work together
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's our common practice to share
 
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
Statewide data with respect to the
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
specific commissions we have
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
representation on both commissions so
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
Services are members of those
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
commissions of The Chronic the
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
disease as well as the Merrimack pfas
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
related commissions so we work closely
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
with commission members we work closely
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
with each other and we certainly would
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
share information with respect to Sports
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
we we work collaboratively on the
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
development of those reports and
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
oftentimes those are reports are are
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
providing information to the commission
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
on what the Departments have done over
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
the past period of time relative to
 
01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:33.980 align:start position:0%
either pfas or relative to other
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
disease concerns and so we have sort of
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
a running list of items that we report
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
back to the commissions on as we have
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
participated in those discussions on the
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
commission and and that is a pretty
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
regular practice the mou sort of
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
memorializes that but it's really
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
practice that we would do anyway so if
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
so specifically the data share does not
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
talk you're not talking about pooling
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
data and creating a database of pool
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
data between Des and your department I'm
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
currently each department has a its own
 
01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:17.329 align:start position:0%
currently each department has a its own
databases

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
databases
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um but certainly sharing data across
 
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:23.780 align:start position:0%
agencies helps inform whatever the topic
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
of re of you know consideration is you
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
know the data that we have that might be
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
relevant to the issue at hand versus the
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
data that Des has but no we aren't
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
currently pursuing a combined database
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
if that's the question yeah
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you manager so these two
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
commissions are they are both ongoing
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
how often do they meet
 
01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:50.339 align:start position:0%
I believe they both meet on a monthly
 
01:05:50.339 --> 01:05:51.470 align:start position:0%
I believe they both meet on a monthly
basis

01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
and I know that they um
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
have a few more years left in terms of
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
their term
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh they are
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
for your commissions and there's two
 
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
years left two years left in there
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you they already have a sunset
 
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.789 align:start position:0%
thank you they already have a sunset
excellent

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
other representative true
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
does this feel this no does this bill
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
have you do something new that you're
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
I would say that the reporting
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
requirements the one reporting
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
requirement would would be to share the
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
report with the um uh the Merrimack
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
commission the Merrimack pfas commission
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
we refer to it as HB 737 it's the um the
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
terminology here but so that that would
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
be a new element and changing the
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
reporting frequency to one year as
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
opposed to every six months would also
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
be somewhat new we already do the
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
reporting as it is it would be a change
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
in the reporting frequency and then
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
sharing that report with the other
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
commission the Merrimack Commission
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add in for some
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
background as in uh when the data
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
sharing agreement language was put in
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bill by representative Pearson in
 
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.930 align:start position:0%
the bill by representative Pearson in
2018

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:13.940 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:17.780 align:start position:0%
to put it in statute the DHHS and Des
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
would its statute be required to share
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
data as Michelle has already said we've
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
always that's always been our standard
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
practice I think there were some
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
Community concerns related to
 
01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
communities that have been affected by
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
pfas and the potential Health impacts
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
and it just was something that was put
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
forward to make sure that it was a
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
requirement so those communities could
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
be reassured that this work is ongoing
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
so that's just some background that I
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and did I hear
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
you say I don't know if you were talking
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
about uh an agreement or understanding
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
that it must lapse so it can be reviewed
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I can speak a little bit to that so
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
the terminology that's currently in
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
statute and in the proposed bill is
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
um a memorandum of agreement and the
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
Department's understanding is is that
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
the term memorandum of agreement and
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding are
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
interchangeable but I do want to inform
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
the commission that the division of
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
administrative Services has recently
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
developed its Manual of procedures or
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
modified its Manual of procedures
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
referred to as mop and specifically
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
there is a a standard out there a number
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
161 that refers to the terminology of
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
memorandum of of understanding along
 
01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:39.980 align:start position:0%
with some formatting requirements
 
01:08:42.249 --> 01:08:42.259 align:start position:0%
associated with any
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding between
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
agencies as representative Nancy Murphy
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
mentioned during her testimony
 
01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:51.890 align:start position:0%
mentioned during her testimony
um

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
for consistency
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
if the commission if the committee would
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
would like you could revise the language
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
of memorandum of agreement that's in in
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
the statue in the proposed Bill to
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding because that
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
is the language that the depart
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services is
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
currently using that being said as I
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
noted both of those terms are used
 
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
noted both of those terms are used
interchangeably

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeably
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the department is currently
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services on revising
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
um the memory revising the Moa and we
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
currently have a draft as an mou so
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
we're working through that using the
 
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.269 align:start position:0%
we're working through that using the
current

01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
um division of style exactly
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question so
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
with both of these
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
commissions that are looking at
 
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:48.980 align:start position:0%
environmental health
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
expiring in two years should your
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreement and this
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
I guess I can speak to the reporting
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
requirement I think that if the
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
commission no longer exists we wouldn't
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
be able to report out to that commission
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I think that that is a
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
a reasonable understanding okay
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see one
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public hearing
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative Burr this
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
yes because it sounds like they need to
 
01:10:58.500 --> 01:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
yes because it sounds like they need to
foreign

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to open up the public
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb366 and welcome back
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
so hi I'm Eric Gallagher
 
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.770 align:start position:0%
so hi I'm Eric Gallagher
um

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.149 align:start position:0%
um
for

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
people who missed my previous
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
introduction I'm representing uh
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
Meramec County District 20 that's
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
conquered Ward 6.
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
um so I am here
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce
 
01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:19.940 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
366 prohibiting certain non-compete
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
causes and non-disclosure agreements
 
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
regarding free software projects and the
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
sharing of Open Source software
 
01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.209 align:start position:0%
sharing of Open Source software
um so

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
some of you who were on this
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee last term
 
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
committee last term
um

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
may remember that
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
last term
 
01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:43.850 align:start position:0%
last term
um

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
I had
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
come before
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
this committee uh House Bill 1273 that I
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
called my software act which is an
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
acronym for securing our freedom to
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
 
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.790 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
so

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
part of the reason
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
that bill died was because the committee
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
determined that I was trying to do too
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
much in a single bill so
 
01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.229 align:start position:0%
much in a single bill so
um

01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
but I think I do remember some of you
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
saying that there were some good parts
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
in it so I decided to
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
try breaking it apart into
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
several bills this year
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
to see if
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
the bill as a hall can't pass then maybe
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
at least hunt the individual parts
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh can pass
 
01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:44.990 align:start position:0%
uh can pass
so

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
um this one is the part specifically
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
about non-compete clauses and
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements
 
01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.189 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements
um

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:56.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh not non-competed agreements or
 
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.250 align:start position:0%
uh not non-competed agreements or
something

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
been growing in unpopularity
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
over recent years
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
they're basically
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
ways of
 
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
ways of
for

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.229 align:start position:0%
for
companies

01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
their employees from doing things
 
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.890 align:start position:0%
their employees from doing things
um

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah I come from the free and open
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
source software community and oftentimes
 
01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.689 align:start position:0%
source software community and oftentimes
you'll

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
01:19:32.699 --> 01:19:34.189 align:start position:0%
you'll
hear

01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
the in the free and open source software
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
Community you'll hear
 
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.950 align:start position:0%
Community you'll hear
um

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
developers from proprietary software
 
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.669 align:start position:0%
developers from proprietary software
companies

01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
they can't help on such a such an issue
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
because something in their contract so
 
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.090 align:start position:0%
because something in their contract so
um

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.290 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
um use
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
you see uh there there has been other
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
legislation to restrict non-competes
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
previously I think some for low-income
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
workers uh
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
and then another I think for last term
 
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.649 align:start position:0%
and then another I think for last term
was

01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
was
um

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
about public health regulations
 
01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:21.950 align:start position:0%
about public health regulations
um

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
releasing uh
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
people from non-competes in those cases
 
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.090 align:start position:0%
people from non-competes in those cases
um

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:28.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
so the um Biden Administration
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
has actually been
 
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.689 align:start position:0%
has actually been
considering

01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
um breaking out the big hammer and just
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
um ending non-competes entirely
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
like every single type
 
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.370 align:start position:0%
like every single type
um

01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
so that's not what this bill does this
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
just focused on the ones uh that would
 
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.850 align:start position:0%
just focused on the ones uh that would
prevent

01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
software developers from contributing to
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
free and open source software projects
 
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.390 align:start position:0%
free and open source software projects
um

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
because that's what I have a particular
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.149 align:start position:0%
interest in
um

01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would be open to going bigger
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
um if that's something that there's
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.550 align:start position:0%
interest in
um

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.810 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah why why do this at the state level
 
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.250 align:start position:0%
yeah why why do this at the state level
if

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
um there's also changes coming at the
 
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
national level well I think it's good
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
just kind of as a backup uh the buy
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
administration's plan is to do so by
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
administrative rule making
 
01:21:40.739 --> 01:21:42.229 align:start position:0%
administrative rule making
which

01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:21:42.239 --> 01:21:43.010 align:start position:0%
which
um

01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:46.940 align:start position:0%
isn't quite as permanent uh
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
executive branch rulemaking can often
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
change whenever there's a new president
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
um and Things by
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
statute are
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
a bit firmer
 
01:21:59.040 --> 01:21:59.689 align:start position:0%
a bit firmer
um

01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:59.699 --> 01:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
and yeah I think just to signal that New
 
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.590 align:start position:0%
and yeah I think just to signal that New
Hampshire

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
is a welcoming place for
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
software developers from the free and
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
open source software Community to come
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
um live and work
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
it helps us as a state
 
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.490 align:start position:0%
it helps us as a state
uh

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
to have this legislation now
 
01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
when I brought this legislation
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh here last term
 
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.810 align:start position:0%
uh here last term
uh

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions I got was uh about
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
security concerns
 
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.810 align:start position:0%
security concerns
um

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.149 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
I added a closet at this time around to
 
01:22:56.169 --> 01:22:56.179 align:start position:0%
uh make an
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
exception for National Security to make
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:01.970 align:start position:0%
sure that
um

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
people yeah people can't
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
violate our national security
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
 
01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:12.290 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
um

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's basic
 
01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.709 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's basic
um

01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
so to address one possible
 
01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
so to address one possible
Point

01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
Point
 
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.470 align:start position:0%
Point
um

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
some people might say that
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:25.790 align:start position:0%
some people might say that
well

01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:27.739 align:start position:0%
copyright law
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
is the federal domain so we shouldn't be
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
trying to do it at the state level well
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
so this isn't really copyright law per
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
se this is at the intersection of
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
copyrights and contracts and contracts
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
are something we do have
 
01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:44.930 align:start position:0%
are something we do have
um

01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.370 align:start position:0%
um
a

01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
say in here at the state level so it's
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
basically saying
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
when there's a conflict
 
01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.149 align:start position:0%
when there's a conflict
between

01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:57.470 align:start position:0%
between
a

01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
free software license
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
and either a non-competing agreement or
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
a non-disclosure agreement then the free
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
software license wins and the state
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
shall not enforce
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
that other agreement
 
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:15.649 align:start position:0%
that other agreement
um

01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is basically
 
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.370 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is basically
um

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
let just legislation to
 
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.850 align:start position:0%
let just legislation to
um

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
help out the free software Community
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I'll take any
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.850 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know I I worked in software
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
engineering for over 40 years in both
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
proprietary and
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
free and open software but I there's a
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
section here that I'd like some
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on because I don't know
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
precisely what it's referencing it says
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
starting line 18
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
can prevent an employee from sharing the
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
source code of free and open lice
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
assault I'm sorry free and open source
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
software that such employee would
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
otherwise normally be able to share
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
under the license what precisely is that
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
so basically like
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
if the if the um
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
software's license statement that's how
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
ignore software normally comes with
 
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
source code comes with license States
 
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
and it's in it
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes they will say explicitly
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
you have the freedom to copy this
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
um so
um

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah and that that applies to most
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
normal people
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so it's basically if that person were
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
not an employee at that company
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and we're operating solely based on
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
that license
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
um if the license says you may share
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
this then it's basically saying then the
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
license is right and you may actually
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
share this
 
01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.930 align:start position:0%
share this
follow-up

01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
um I mean if you just
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
got some free or open source software
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
and used it and then
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you know sharing it doesn't really
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
mean anything because it's already out
 
01:26:16.679 --> 01:26:17.450 align:start position:0%
mean anything because it's already out
there

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
in public domain are you talking about a
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
situation where the employee took this
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
free and open source software modified
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
it and then wants to share the result is
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
is that what you're getting at uh yeah
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's more along the lines of yeah if
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
they want to make contributions back
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
Upstream as they call it in the software
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
world they're allowed um Upstream
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
referring to the project that's
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
developing that software then they can
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
do that as well
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me representative
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
Gallagher are you saying that you
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
that you encourage
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
visuals to modify this software on their
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
employees their employers time and then
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
give it away
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh this doesn't say anything about being
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
on their time or not this is like when
 
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
they go home
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes employers will
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
claim rights over what their employees
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
do in their free time as well besides
 
01:27:17.639 --> 01:27:19.189 align:start position:0%
do in their free time as well besides
just

01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the things that they do on Company
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
hours uh so this is
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
this this is more about things that uh
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
the employees do in their free time
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know how how the state
 
01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:39.620 align:start position:0%
would ever be able to enforce that well
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
if I if I may respond this is more about
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state not enforcing it something
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's about the state not enforcing the
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
contract so it wouldn't require to say
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
actively doing anything it would just
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
require the state saying no I'm not
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
actually going to enforce that but yeah
 
01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
actually going to enforce that but yeah
anyways

01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien thank
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman thank you
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
 
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.169 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
question

01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you mentioned on line 21 the
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
National Security needs but I'm very
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
fearful with the uh the baby booms the
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
Aging everything else like that and
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
you've brought up the term upstreaming
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
what's to stop somebody of Nefarious
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
means from upstreaming a virus and then
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
passing it out and then future can uh
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
contamination it seems that's handled
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
within the corporate world but if
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
somebody individual that's nefarious it
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
could be open Prairie
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
so in the free and open source software
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
world we have something that's called
 
01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:47.900 align:start position:0%
The Many Eyes principle where basically
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
the more people look at the code for
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
something the greater the chance is that
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
they'll find vulnerabilities
 
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
in it so
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah if somebody wanted to
 
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh try to contribute malware to the
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
Upstream of a free and open source
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
software project then
 
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.530 align:start position:0%
software project then
the

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
most projects that run like this have
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
software review practices in place
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
already to catch things like that
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
um so I think it would be
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
handled in the normal way
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:38.699 --> 01:29:39.649 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
this is probably somewhat dated but
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
years ago I was told that Unix was open
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
source right and that the various other
 
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
things Red Hat this and Linux that were
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
they were using the open source but they
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
had put in a couple of proprietary
 
01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
things that were their own that they
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
an open source thing and then if you
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
were working
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
one of these proprietary companies
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's making their own modifications
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
and then went
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
onto the some kind of Unix form and
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's some information there that's
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
proprietary that you should not be
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
sharing right
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
well yeah so yeah there are companies
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
like red hat and IBM that work both in
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
the uh free software world and in the
 
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
proprietary software World
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah part um
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
so part of the thing to remember here is
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
the definition of free software uh so
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about free software in the
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
sense of freedom of preserving the users
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
freedoms so one of the freedoms that
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
free software comes with is the freedom
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
to sell it so
 
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.410 align:start position:0%
to sell it so
um

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh companies companies like red hat
 
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.169 align:start position:0%
yeah uh companies companies like red hat
um

01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
their software
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah sometimes they do sell software
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
that the source is already available for
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the way they're able to make money
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
off of that is because it's through
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
things like support contracts and
 
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
um you know they'll be in the position
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
of saying all right
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
so where we'll we'll help you with it if
 
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
it breaks it because
 
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
it breaks it because
um

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know the where we we actually
 
01:31:41.169 --> 01:31:41.179 align:start position:0%
understand it and um can provide you
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
with documentation
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
on how to actually use it so um
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:31:51.179 --> 01:31:52.669 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
I

01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:56.900 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that this legislation
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
would prevent companies from doing that
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
te

01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
te
 
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Adam chair members of
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
is Dennis Goulet I'm the commissioner
 
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Information
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
Technology I'm here to testify in
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill today
 
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
um I would start out by
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
observing that the the language is is
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
quite expansive and I think it would be
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of cases where it
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to determine whether
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
it applied or not so here's that that
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
starts out with a pretty large challenge
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
there and I'm going to take you through
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
a kind of a state government perspective
 
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
and then the larger State perspective uh
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
on this and coming from uh just coming
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
from a background of I spent almost my
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
entire career in the software industry
 
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:12.980 align:start position:0%
either as an I.T person or a running
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
commercial software development projects
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
as well as open source development
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
projects so I have a lot of experience
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
in this space and the IP intellectual
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
property space
 
01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:24.770 align:start position:0%
property space
um

01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
so from a state perspective we actually
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
contractually in most cases hold
 
01:33:33.169 --> 01:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
proprietary interest in the software
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
that we pay to develop so for example
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you know if we have a specific uh
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
piece of software and another state
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to use it for example a lot of
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
times we'll negotiate with the state and
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
most times it you know we share it but
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
that software may or may not have open
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
source libraries built into it
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
but we maintain at least today uh that
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
you know if we developed something say
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
for HHS or whatever they that they'd
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
hold proprietary interest in it and
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
event the vendor who developed it for us
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily be able to go and
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
reuse it or the or the intellectual
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
property associated with using those
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
open source libraries
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is agencies
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies will have regulatory
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
challenges we often write into contracts
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
and HHS is kind of the the grand the
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
great granddaddy of this where because
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
of the types of data that we're managing
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
the having having openness with respect
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
to any aspects of the the
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
um of the the product itself or the
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
software that we're using to run the
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
state business is is problematic so
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
sharing of
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
sharing of Open Source Code in the
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
context of a larger State application
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
could be pretty problematic from a
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
security and privacy perspective and
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'll talk more a little about the uh the
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
many eyes principle at the end
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
so there's fundamental ambiguity in in
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
the case of of uh the you know trying to
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
differentiate between a company holding
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
proprietary interest in software and
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
this this language
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
um the two cases I think of you I heard
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
you discussed one of them earlier which
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
was companies that that actually Market
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
you know open source um uh Linux Unix we
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually the state runs hundreds of
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
instances of of Linux for example and we
 
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
we do pay for support and uh so there's
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
open source Linux out there and then
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
there's Linux where a an employee of a
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
company may have proprietary interest in
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and that's
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally ambiguous the other
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguity is that many many products
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're ones we're running in
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state or um
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
or or commercial software products have
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
open source libraries in them now I've
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
signed not signed and lived under
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements pretty much
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
until I came to New Hampshire seven and
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
a half years ago as the CIO and um
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
you know it it never harms me but I
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
understood that you know particularly
 
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
when I was in the engineering side of
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
these products that the the open source
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
libraries are in context with the
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
intellectual property that was developed
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and invested in by that company so I
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
would argue that the the company does
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
have a right to proprietary interest in
 
01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.470 align:start position:0%
have a right to proprietary interest in
that

01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
now recently from a cyber security
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
perspective that has caused a lot of
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
problems the log 4J incident if you look
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
that up that that's causing caused us un
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
uncounted hours of effort trying to find
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
all the places where that you know that
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
open source Library exists so on you
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
know on the one hand where you know it
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
was nice to have that open source
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
Library built into a product on the
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
other hand it did in fact create some
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
pretty significant security
 
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that are well documented
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
in in the in the world
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
um the
the

01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
what I wrote up in the fiscal note
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
really was more of taking a broader
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
perspective of you know there was a
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
question that came up is how would we
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know regulate or adjudicate this I
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
would argue that
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
um because of the ambiguity and the
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
expansiveness of it it would be it would
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
be pretty challenging to um to do so and
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think an entity would have to be
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
established to do that at probably at
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
the state level the other thing I would
 
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
argue is that
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
um you know because we're gonna you know
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
we are trying to chip away at this idea
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
of proprietary interest in New Hampshire
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
I think that it you know from take going
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
to the other side of my career
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
um you know if I were in an executive in
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
a software company I said do I want to
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
locate in New Hampshire and create jobs
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I I'd be thinking twice
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
about it if I was perceiving the state
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
as unfriendly to proprietary interest in
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
technology finally the the many eyes
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
principle is one from a cyber security
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
perspective I've heard it twice today
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
probably going to hear it some more
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
because these you know is rep Gallagher
 
01:38:11.159 --> 01:38:12.050 align:start position:0%
because these you know is rep Gallagher
indicated

01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
um the um that was one bill with a bunch
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
of stuff in it now it's a whole bunch of
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
different bills they're the other side
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
of the many eyes principle is that it's
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's easy every software has
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities every every piece and um
 
01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
so even if it goes through review I've
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know I've done commercial software
 
01:38:33.129 --> 01:38:33.139 align:start position:0%
development multiple layers of review
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
we've still we've still published
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
software with vulnerabilities being able
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
to look and see and find those
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities as a as a a criminal or
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
somebody with Mal intent is inherently
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
much easier in an open source context
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
than it is in a um in a proprietary
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
context so that's the other side of that
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
coin but I do agree in in the open
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
source world it's pretty self-regulating
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
for the most part so I I think you could
 
01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:06.860 align:start position:0%
manage an open source context and still
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
produce software that was at least as
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
good as what you do in a proprietary
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
context that that uh concludes my formal
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm noticing a stunned look so uh
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
yes okay without objection so I'd like
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
to make a motion of itl on House Bill
 
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.470 align:start position:0%
to make a motion of itl on House Bill
366.

01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
366.
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second second
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to speak to your
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
motion uh I would so I'm actually a uh
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
you know I think open source software is
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
a great thing I've both been a user of
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
it and done work to contribute to it
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's not the issue and and some
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the concerns about it I think were
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
overstated but
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to this for two reasons
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
one is I am let's just say very
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
reluctant to uh interfere in in private
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
contracts including you know employment
 
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.970 align:start position:0%
contracts including you know employment
contracts

01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
um so that would probably you know seal
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
my position in and of itself the other
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
issue is that um
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I mean the real there's a lot of
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
stuff talk about open source software
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't think this really applies
 
01:40:47.209 --> 01:40:47.219 align:start position:0%
to the main thing was um
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know if you can get the source code
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
anybody can get the source code for open
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
source software you can make changes to
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
it and then you can provide it back to
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
the open source community and and it can
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of be reviewed and they decide
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether to incorporate it in in that and
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
so everybody could use it and the issue
 
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
is if you're an employee at a company
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
and you're doing you're doing this then
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's two issues one is it really on
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
your time or the employer's time I think
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's actually the Lesser problem but
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
it is is an issue the other thing is is
 
01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.510 align:start position:0%
it is is an issue the other thing is is
that

01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the work you're doing at the company
 
01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.930 align:start position:0%
in the work you're doing at the company
there's

01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.709 align:start position:0%
there's
um

01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
ideas uh Concepts
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
um you know things that you learn and
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
are develop paid for by the company as
 
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:33.980 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
and you know you're likely going to
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
whether you mean to or not going to
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into the changes you
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
make to this software that you're you're
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
releasing to the whole world and so
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
you know you're both taking you're
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
almost certainly taking
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
something the employers paid for and
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
basically giving it away and potentially
 
01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:55.370 align:start position:0%
basically giving it away and potentially
more

01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and and that's you know you can't
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that means unless somebody's
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
like blatant just steals a bunch of code
 
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
and sticks it in it which they'd be
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
foolish to do I mean it's really hard to
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
tell whether that's really what's going
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
on or not and uh so given that as much
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
as I I strongly support open source
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
software I think it's a great thing
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and I might even encourage employers
 
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.490 align:start position:0%
um and I might even encourage employers
to

01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
you know that they might attract I mean
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
an employer if they can attract better
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
or more potential employees by not
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
having this non-compete in then it's in
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
their business interest to do it uh but
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's our place to tell
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
them they can't and because there are
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
potential problems for the employer so
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie do you
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
just speak to your second
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%

01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you okay

01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
Gearhart stepped out to to testify on
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:25.250 --> 03:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
03:16:27.790 --> 03:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill
 
03:16:31.250 --> 03:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
327 and calling on representative
 
03:16:31.260 --> 03:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
327 and calling on representative
Gallagher

03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.800 --> 03:17:06.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:17:06.650 --> 03:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:10.450 align:start position:0%
 
Gallagher

03:17:10.450 --> 03:17:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative for Merrimack County
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
District 20 which is Concord Ward 6.
 
03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:18.110 align:start position:0%
District 20 which is Concord Ward 6.
um

03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:24.530 --> 03:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
so I am here this time to introduce
 
03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 327 prohibiting the state
 
03:17:28.969 --> 03:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
from requiring
 
03:17:31.790 --> 03:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public to use proprietary
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
software when visiting State websites
 
03:17:35.399 --> 03:17:36.530 align:start position:0%
software when visiting State websites
um

03:17:36.530 --> 03:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:38.210 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
this kind of ties in with my previous
 
03:17:41.870 --> 03:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
one I'll
 
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
repeat I'll be repeating myself a little
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
bit just for anyone who's only tuning in
 
03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
bit just for anyone who's only tuning in
now

03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:17:50.830 --> 03:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
anyways so this was part of
 
03:17:54.300 --> 03:17:55.790 align:start position:0%
anyways so this was part of
uh

03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:58.130 --> 03:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
last years
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1273
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
which I referred to as my software act
 
03:18:09.889 --> 03:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
an acronym for securing our freedom to
 
03:18:12.769 --> 03:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
 
03:18:12.779 --> 03:18:13.790 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
um

03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh it was an Omnibus
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
about promoting software freedom in the
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:18:22.319 --> 03:18:23.269 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
um

03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:23.279 --> 03:18:24.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:28.370 --> 03:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
one of the EXO it came before this
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee last term and one of the
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
pieces of feedback
 
03:18:38.090 --> 03:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
I got about it was what it was trying to
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
do too much in a single bill so I
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh took that advice to heart or that
 
03:18:49.610 --> 03:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
feedback to heart and uh
 
03:18:53.389 --> 03:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
Lewis split it into
 
03:18:56.690 --> 03:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
several different bills so that way
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
we could confirm consider all of the
 
03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
individual parts
 
03:19:04.190 --> 03:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
separately to
 
03:19:04.200 --> 03:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
separately to
um

03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
see see just which of those
 
03:19:11.389 --> 03:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
the individual parts that were actually
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
kind of good were
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:18.849 --> 03:19:18.859 align:start position:0%
um this one
 
03:19:24.530 --> 03:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
specifically is about State websites
 
03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:26.269 align:start position:0%
specifically is about State websites
um

03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:26.279 --> 03:19:28.490 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:19:28.490 --> 03:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is basically
 
03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:31.730 align:start position:0%
this is basically
um

03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
the bill calling for Libra JS
 
03:19:37.969 --> 03:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
compatibility on
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
State websites
 
03:19:39.960 --> 03:19:41.389 align:start position:0%
State websites
um

03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it says it's got kind of some tricky
 
03:19:44.520 --> 03:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
so it says it's got kind of some tricky
wording

03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
wording
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um not requiring
 
03:19:55.010 --> 03:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
users to allow the
 
03:19:58.730 --> 03:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
execution of proprietary JavaScript so
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:06.050 --> 03:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
that that means
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
that basically it just has to have a
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
graceful fallback for
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh when the user
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
is browsing with an extension like Libra
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
JS enabled or with JavaScript disabled
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
entirely so and
 
03:20:22.680 --> 03:20:23.630 align:start position:0%
entirely so and
um

03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
the reason for this
 
03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:27.429 align:start position:0%
the reason for this
um

03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
asked outlined um
 
03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
in an article called the JavaScript trap
 
03:20:36.830 --> 03:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
is because when there are
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh proprietary pieces of JavaScript on
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
websites they can uh they they violate
 
03:20:48.530 --> 03:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
users freedoms to be browsing the web
 
03:20:51.230 --> 03:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
they want to they can insert tracking
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
data and or tracking tags to collect
 
03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
data to send to private companies
 
03:20:58.380 --> 03:20:59.389 align:start position:0%
data to send to private companies
um so

03:20:59.389 --> 03:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
this would basically just be giving the
 
03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:03.290 align:start position:0%
this would basically just be giving the
users

03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
users
 
03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
freedom to
 
03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
disable that
 
03:21:07.380 --> 03:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
disable that
um

03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:08.880 --> 03:21:10.610 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:21:10.610 --> 03:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:13.250 --> 03:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
and the idea
 
03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.300 --> 03:21:19.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
interactions with the state that are
 
03:21:25.849 --> 03:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
legally required like
 
03:21:25.859 --> 03:21:28.730 align:start position:0%
legally required like
um

03:21:28.730 --> 03:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.740 --> 03:21:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:31.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
basically ones where the user doesn't
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
have another way around it because they
 
03:21:39.410 --> 03:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
have to interact with the state through
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
the website
 
03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
the website
um

03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:47.090 --> 03:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
so and um yeah the language
 
03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:48.410 align:start position:0%
so and um yeah the language
is

03:21:48.410 --> 03:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:21:50.929 --> 03:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as
 
03:21:54.650 --> 03:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
it appeared in um
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
last year's Bill except
 
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:22:03.530 --> 03:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
there is one minor difference
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
um there was an and that changed to I
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
changed to an or just to give between so
 
03:22:14.809 --> 03:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
they can either the department of it can
 
03:22:14.819 --> 03:22:15.710 align:start position:0%
they can either the department of it can
either

03:22:15.710 --> 03:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
use a browser extension like Libra JS I
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
didn't say that specifically because I
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
didn't want to preference a single
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
organization's work but so if they can
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
find another one that does the same
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
thing they could also use that
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
or by confirming that no proprietary
 
03:22:38.349 --> 03:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
JavaScript blocks the functioning of any
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
third-party online
 
03:22:43.610 --> 03:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
archiving services so like the Wayback
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
machine on the internet archive
 
03:22:50.690 --> 03:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
we have web pages if New Hampshire State
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
web pages
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
render properly when
 
03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh loaded in the internet archive then
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
they would pass this test so
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
um they can do either one or the other
 
03:23:08.410 --> 03:23:08.420 align:start position:0%
it's their choice on how to verify it
 
03:23:12.530 --> 03:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I think this would be
 
03:23:15.170 --> 03:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
a good way
 
03:23:15.180 --> 03:23:17.210 align:start position:0%
a good way
of

03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:23:18.889 --> 03:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
helping to
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
give back to
 
03:23:25.490 --> 03:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
users some of the freedom of
 
03:23:28.010 --> 03:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
to control
 
03:23:28.020 --> 03:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
to control
their

03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:23:32.809 --> 03:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
experiences when interacting with the
 
03:23:35.210 --> 03:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
state and if that all
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
take questions now
 
03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher I'm
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
confused because you
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
you could limit it to only those
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
transactions or interactions that are
 
03:23:51.710 --> 03:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
legally required it's not in the bill
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
but that's what you said oh that or that
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
was my intent
 
03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
um I okay
 
03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's your intent I that's fine my
 
03:24:03.769 --> 03:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
question is what
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
web transactions are required
 
03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
web transactions are required
well

03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
um like
 
03:24:15.290 --> 03:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
if you could always avoid them by uh
 
03:24:17.929 --> 03:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
going out in person and meeting whoever
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
it is you want to want to deal with
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
well I
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I mean that might be the case now but
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of like if we move to say
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
an all online tax payment system or
 
03:24:35.809 --> 03:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
um or Court appearances or school work
 
03:24:35.819 --> 03:24:37.130 align:start position:0%
um or Court appearances or school work
for

03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:24:40.010 --> 03:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
like kid kids in public schools have to
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
do their schoolwork
 
03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:43.729 align:start position:0%
do their schoolwork
for

03:24:43.729 --> 03:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:24:45.290 --> 03:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
essentially not
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
a preemptive strike against some future
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
situation that may or may not exist in
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
the present
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.410 --> 03:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
is that correct or am I totally am I
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
missing something
 
03:25:12.650 --> 03:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not quite sure if you're
 
03:25:15.410 --> 03:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
correct or not I can't answer that okay
 
03:25:19.010 --> 03:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
fine does anyone else have a question
 
03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah that seems rather that would
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
have us that seems rather shocking to me
 
03:25:34.010 --> 03:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
that is more than I would have expected
 
03:25:34.020 --> 03:25:35.389 align:start position:0%
that is more than I would have expected
personally

03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
personally
 
03:25:35.399 --> 03:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
personally
um

03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's almost like you could buy everybody
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the state their own computer company
 
03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know how they calculated
 
03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:44.690 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know how they calculated
that

03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for sure you have a
 
03:25:55.849 --> 03:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
um oh go ahead
 
03:25:58.200 --> 03:25:59.630 align:start position:0%
um oh go ahead
okay

03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um so you had mentioned uh children
 
03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
needing to do school work on you know
 
03:26:04.969 --> 03:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
for school
 
03:26:06.650 --> 03:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't see it in the bill but was it
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
your intention to push that down
 
03:26:09.650 --> 03:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
potentially to municipalities and school
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
districts as well as state agencies
 
03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.210 align:start position:0%
districts as well as state agencies
um

03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not with this bill specifically I
 
03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:21.469 align:start position:0%
maybe not with this bill specifically I
guess

03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of the side effect of
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
having split this bill into multiple
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
Parts is that
 
03:26:29.399 --> 03:26:30.530 align:start position:0%
Parts is that
um

03:26:30.530 --> 03:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
I might be confusing some stuff I meant
 
03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
to do with one of the other bills with
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
this one
 
03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:39.410 align:start position:0%
this one
so

03:26:39.410 --> 03:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I don't think that would
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
actually come into
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
effect here although I would certainly
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if they
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Brooklyn Gerhard thank you
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair I
 
03:27:00.889 --> 03:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
I actually like the thought behind this
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot of sense I don't
 
03:27:04.130 --> 03:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
understand why we have to be giving up
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
personal data especially when we have
 
03:27:07.610 --> 03:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
rights privacy in New Hampshire if we're
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
going online
 
03:27:11.809 --> 03:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the cost though is
 
03:27:13.969 --> 03:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
insane yeah so if you can get a handle
 
03:27:15.530 --> 03:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
on that that'd be interesting because
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the numbers yeah so
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
anyway I don't believe that
 
03:27:21.889 --> 03:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher could help with
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:27.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:29.090 --> 03:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:27:31.370 --> 03:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
03:27:33.290 --> 03:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
so from understanding this correctly in
 
03:27:40.250 --> 03:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
circumstances like getting a fire permit
 
03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
in our town they choose to only use the
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
online system that the state provides
 
03:27:44.640 --> 03:27:45.469 align:start position:0%
online system that the state provides
now

03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:27:45.479 --> 03:27:47.389 align:start position:0%
now
that

03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking that action you're saying
 
03:27:52.729 --> 03:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
is collecting data behind the scenes
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
that if this bill passed it would allow
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
us to do things that would let us visit
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
that site anonymously to not be
 
03:28:03.530 --> 03:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
collecting other data well I I mean I
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't I or I don't know
 
03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:08.330 align:start position:0%
don't I or I don't know
um your

03:28:08.330 --> 03:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
um your
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
specific towns website how it operates
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
if it has any proprietary JavaScript on
 
03:28:16.370 --> 03:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
it or not
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry it's the State website
 
03:28:20.450 --> 03:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
State website um yeah
 
03:28:20.460 --> 03:28:21.830 align:start position:0%
State website um yeah
um

03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:25.010 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:28:25.010 --> 03:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.020 --> 03:28:25.969 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:28:25.969 --> 03:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:28:25.979 --> 03:28:27.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh but that but that's the thing about
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh when software is
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
proprietary is that you just don't know
 
03:28:38.570 --> 03:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
and you can't really know what exactly
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's doing so the point is
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
give control
 
03:28:46.260 --> 03:28:47.630 align:start position:0%
give control
back

03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
into our own hands so that way we can
 
03:28:52.670 --> 03:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
actually know what all of our software
 
03:28:54.250 --> 03:28:54.260 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair other
 
03:28:56.760 --> 03:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair other
questions

03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:01.490 --> 03:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much all right
 
03:29:02.690 --> 03:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:02.700 --> 03:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:05.210 --> 03:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:29:10.690 --> 03:29:10.700 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 327 represent yes
 
03:29:14.809 --> 03:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:29:24.889 --> 03:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
a reminder I'm Dennis Goulet the
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
03:29:28.729 --> 03:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
Information Technology
 
03:29:28.739 --> 03:29:29.630 align:start position:0%
Information Technology
um

03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'll start out a little differently than
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
I intended and and you know that you
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
know my testimony really covers the
 
03:29:38.210 --> 03:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
executive branch and the fiscal note
 
03:29:40.849 --> 03:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
executive branch only
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
um but I think the same issues would be
 
03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
would apply to the um to the other
 
03:29:47.929 --> 03:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
branches and constitutional offices and
 
03:29:51.530 --> 03:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
I I am testifying in opposition
 
03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
um but the ACT executive branch actually
 
03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
is pretty careful not to collect
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
information that people aren't aware of
 
03:29:58.670 --> 03:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
in fact we have a policy in fact
 
03:30:00.650 --> 03:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
somebody just brought into my attention
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
the other day and asked me if they could
 
03:30:03.650 --> 03:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
have an exception on it and I said
 
03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
03:30:09.410 --> 03:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
um it's for doing the very things that
 
03:30:11.330 --> 03:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
that rep Gallagher was talking about
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is the you know the tracking and
 
03:30:14.570 --> 03:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
the cross-referencing the things that
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
get create all those situations where
 
03:30:18.170 --> 03:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
you get extra stuff popping up in your
 
03:30:19.370 --> 03:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
browser that you didn't really want
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
there so we don't do that in the
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
executive branch I don't think it's done
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
very much at all in in state government
 
03:30:28.190 --> 03:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
websites but I couldn't speak to the
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
other uh Parts the
 
03:30:34.849 --> 03:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
um the so I'll make my testimony simple
 
03:30:36.410 --> 03:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
and then I'm sure you'll probably have
 
03:30:37.849 --> 03:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
some questions maybe on the fiscal note
 
03:30:40.729 --> 03:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
or whatever but there's
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know obviously the the bill itself
 
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
to implement this as written would be
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
very expensive we we put a range in the
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
in our in our in our calculation
 
03:30:53.330 --> 03:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
assumptions in the fiscal note and I I
 
03:30:55.370 --> 03:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
didn't just pull those numbers out of a
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
hat you know we I talked to people we
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
looked at recent things that we had done
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
um there are almost 80 State websites on
 
03:31:08.769 --> 03:31:08.779 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and there are over
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
270 applications that are hosted on our
 
03:31:15.170 --> 03:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
websites to do things that citizens do
 
03:31:15.180 --> 03:31:16.309 align:start position:0%
websites to do things that citizens do
like

03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
um you know like tax for example
 
03:31:22.729 --> 03:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the some of most of those
 
03:31:25.969 --> 03:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
applications are vendor applications so
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with this we would
 
03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
either induce the vendor to go and do
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
what what it would take to comply
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
um which we'd have to pay him to do or
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe we'd have to re-procure the app
 
03:31:41.809 --> 03:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the one of the
 
03:31:43.250 --> 03:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
challenging things about that is we'd
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
have to actually have to look at each
 
03:31:46.080 --> 03:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
have to actually have to look at each
application

03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:31:51.769 --> 03:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
um in detail to figure out whether there
 
03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
was any proprietary JavaScript running
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
on it and and then cause that to be
 
03:32:00.370 --> 03:32:00.380 align:start position:0%
remediated now I I in my last job I was
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
I was in charge of commercial software
 
03:32:06.050 --> 03:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
development for healthcare I.T and I had
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
six products
 
03:32:09.889 --> 03:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
and when I was there and now I could not
 
03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
tell you whether I had proprietary
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
JavaScript in them and where it was if
 
03:32:15.769 --> 03:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
it was there so I would have had to do a
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
deep dive into you know and one of the
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
apps had seven million lines of code so
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
talking a fairly you know fairly
 
03:32:25.929 --> 03:32:25.939 align:start position:0%
extensive process to get that done
 
03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
but the cost to me isn't isn't the most
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
challenging part of this it would be in
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
order to remediate this I would you know
 
03:32:36.889 --> 03:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
or to be in compliance I would shift our
 
03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
efforts away from the program work we're
 
03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing in the agencies to this work
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
so this work would have to be let's
 
03:32:47.330 --> 03:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
pretend it's free for a minute this work
 
03:32:48.830 --> 03:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be pretty darn important
 
03:32:51.170 --> 03:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
for us to stop doing what we're we're
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
doing now and move to other work and uh
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
and it deep in the in the calculations
 
03:32:58.969 --> 03:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note there are some
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
contract folks there that we would bring
 
03:33:03.309 --> 03:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
in to help if we had to do it but again
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
it would it would heavily impact state
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
labor and again I don't see the benefit
 
03:33:13.610 --> 03:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
because we're not really doing
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not tracking we're
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
being very careful on privacy in fact I
 
03:33:20.330 --> 03:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
have you know we'll we'll be working on
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to get funded in the
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
budget a Chief privacy officer so I
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
think we get even better than that
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
because I think that you know what we're
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
seeing in States now and I think we
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
should see in New Hampshire is taking
 
03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
privacy more seriously instead of doing
 
03:33:35.690 --> 03:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
it a bit here a bit there have
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
overriding privacy policies and you know
 
03:33:41.690 --> 03:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
model ourselves after some of the the
 
03:33:44.450 --> 03:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
leading privacy advocates in the world
 
03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
like you see some stuff like you've
 
03:33:48.050 --> 03:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
probably experienced now when you go
 
03:33:49.550 --> 03:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
into websites where they tell you
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to track you before they
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
track you you know or they tell you you
 
03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
know or you have to the default is if
 
03:33:57.769 --> 03:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
any information is going to travel it's
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
an opt-in not a you have to go opt out
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
just little principles like that but
 
03:34:02.809 --> 03:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
those are principles that are important
 
03:34:06.530 --> 03:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
to us and um where you know I think
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
I like the idea I really love the idea
 
03:34:11.450 --> 03:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
of not taking data from people without
 
03:34:13.130 --> 03:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
them knowing it and I certainly won't be
 
03:34:15.650 --> 03:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
advocating for that as as the um
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
as the um CIO and the commissioner so I
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
think that concludes my formal testimony
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any and all
 
03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:27.650 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any and all
questions

03:34:27.650 --> 03:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:28.859 --> 03:34:29.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:31.969 --> 03:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I I support the idea of what he's
 
03:34:34.190 --> 03:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
trying to do you know I I worked uh
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
software engineering for over 40 years
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
both proprietary and and uh free
 
03:34:41.929 --> 03:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
software and and I you know my view is
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
he's right that if you're there that
 
03:34:46.010 --> 03:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
sort of JavaScript stops running on
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
someone's system they can't know what
 
03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
you're collecting or not
 
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's the issue so my question
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
is I mean the cost is a huge issue and I
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
can kind of understand where it's coming
 
03:34:54.960 --> 03:34:56.150 align:start position:0%
can kind of understand where it's coming
from

03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:34:57.410 --> 03:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
the question is what would your feeling
 
03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
be and what would the cost be
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
if we said going forward any new
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
application or a major redo of existing
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
Applications had this requirement
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a good question and uh
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
you know it isn't in the bill itself but
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
when I wrote up the the fiscal note I
 
03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:17.630 align:start position:0%
when I wrote up the the fiscal note I
did

03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
I did write that as as what I considered
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
a technical flaw because what it would
 
03:35:22.969 --> 03:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
do is it would
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
narrow I think it would narrow the field
 
03:35:28.849 --> 03:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of who could bid on new stuff
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
it might narrow it a lot
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
so that's that would be my the challenge
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think we still we'd still create a a
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
situation for ourselves which I think
 
03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
could be managed in other ways
 
03:35:45.170 --> 03:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up what do you mean by
 
03:35:47.450 --> 03:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
managed in other ways um I think that
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in the you know states
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
that have hired Chief privacy officers
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and corporate entities have strong
 
03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
policies that they Implement and I would
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know if we if we were able to fund a
 
03:35:59.330 --> 03:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
Chief privacy officer function I would
 
03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
want their authority to have the force
 
03:36:03.410 --> 03:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
of law to implement policy in the
 
03:36:06.050 --> 03:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
executive branch so that we were doing
 
03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
the right things with technology so it's
 
03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:09.950 align:start position:0%
the right things with technology so it's
uh

03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
from a privacy perspective thank you
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:36:26.210 --> 03:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me
 
03:36:28.370 --> 03:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to prohibit the state
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
from requiring the public to use the
 
03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
priority of software when visiting State
 
03:36:32.340 --> 03:36:34.190 align:start position:0%
priority of software when visiting State
websites

03:36:34.190 --> 03:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
websites
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
and then you answer please consider me
 
03:36:37.969 --> 03:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
to be a child
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
or a golden retriever
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
they just give me an idea of what we're
 
03:36:44.210 --> 03:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:36:46.849 --> 03:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
sure thing representative true
 
03:36:46.859 --> 03:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
sure thing representative true
so

03:36:48.410 --> 03:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
um rep Gallagher kind of talked about it
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
is if there were a if a um
 
03:36:58.190 --> 03:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
a user came into a State website
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
they would be able to to interact with
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
it in a way that didn't run the software
 
03:37:07.490 --> 03:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
that this bill precludes
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:37:12.050 --> 03:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
is that understandable
 
03:37:12.060 --> 03:37:14.450 align:start position:0%
is that understandable
yes

03:37:14.450 --> 03:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
um so and that's why it's it's
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
challenging because it's it's pretty
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
expansive yeah what what does
 
03:37:26.809 --> 03:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
proprietary JavaScript do other I mean I
 
03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
know the idea but what why would you use
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
it other than for tracking
 
03:37:32.399 --> 03:37:33.290 align:start position:0%
it other than for tracking
um

03:37:33.290 --> 03:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's been used for a lot of
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
functionality in in applications it's
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere um in fact I I you heard
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
me testify earlier the log 4J uh
 
03:37:46.190 --> 03:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
security issue that we've been dealing
 
03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
security issue that we've been dealing
with

03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:47.630 align:start position:0%
with
um

03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
we found log 4J libraries everywhere and
 
03:37:55.849 --> 03:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
we're it's taking us a really long time
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
to remediate all of them but some of
 
03:37:58.729 --> 03:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
them are pretty easy to remediate and
 
03:38:00.530 --> 03:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
others are more difficult
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very pervasive and it's
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
used to to implement web functionality
 
03:38:10.490 --> 03:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
so stuff that's going on in front of you
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
is often being is often being
 
03:38:17.530 --> 03:38:17.540 align:start position:0%
implemented via the use of JavaScript
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
represent Gerhard thank you madam chair
 
03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused though so we
 
03:38:29.210 --> 03:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
we put into position a Chief privacy
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
officer but his hands are tied because
 
03:38:33.410 --> 03:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
we can't really Institute these things
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
because then people won't bid on new
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
projects so would it just be better to
 
03:38:41.450 --> 03:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
just downsize the computer-based aspects
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
of a lot of this dude I'm trying to get
 
03:38:44.330 --> 03:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
it it seems like we can't do this unless
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
we track people and we're giving it to
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
third parties we don't know what they're
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
doing with the information I mean
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
realistically it could be anybody right
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
this JavaScript whatever is collecting
 
03:38:54.849 --> 03:38:54.859 align:start position:0%
information and sending it to whoever
 
03:38:58.130 --> 03:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
theoretically but by policy we preclude
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
the doing that
 
03:39:03.650 --> 03:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
and so it's part of our when we procure
 
03:39:03.660 --> 03:39:05.929 align:start position:0%
and so it's part of our when we procure
Solutions

03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
um we
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
we procure it with that in mind and that
 
03:39:11.090 --> 03:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
is part of how we operate and there
 
03:39:12.889 --> 03:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
there are even further restrictions
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what sort of monies are
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
being used and what the agency is
 
03:39:17.929 --> 03:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
because there's different rules on that
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
so Noah if we had a Chief privacy
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
officer our hands would not be tied I
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
think they'd be in fact I think they'd
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
be liberating the limiting the use of
 
03:39:29.809 --> 03:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
Technology would I mean the technology
 
03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
density in the state is going up
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
um is going up because we're using
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
technology to do things faster we're
 
03:39:39.530 --> 03:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
doing it to mitigate Workforce
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
challenges things like that so reducing
 
03:39:43.610 --> 03:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
the amount of tech we use would reduce
 
03:39:45.650 --> 03:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
our services to the citizens and
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:39:52.969 --> 03:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
so you do know where this information is
 
03:39:54.650 --> 03:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
being collected and from who to whom
 
03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's going you do have control over that
 
03:39:56.340 --> 03:39:57.349 align:start position:0%
it's going you do have control over that
yes

03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:39:57.359 --> 03:39:58.729 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

03:39:58.729 --> 03:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
but it's a problem of trying to stop
 
03:40:02.090 --> 03:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
that because you have to find it in the
 
03:40:02.100 --> 03:40:03.469 align:start position:0%
that because you have to find it in the
code

03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
that's how I'm a little I'll just I'll
 
03:40:07.130 --> 03:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
take this offline just figure it out
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for your testimony is
 
03:40:24.170 --> 03:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.180 --> 03:40:26.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
in that case I will close the public
 
03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:37.370 align:start position:0%
in that case I will close the public
hearing

03:40:37.370 --> 03:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:37.380 --> 03:40:41.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:41.450 --> 03:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.050 --> 03:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
I want to go into exact session if
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's all right all right without
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
objection we'll go into exact session
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative it sounds like you have a
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
motion yep I'd like to make a motion of
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill 327 FN second
 
03:41:06.530 --> 03:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay our second Deborah I'm gonna show
 
03:41:06.540 --> 03:41:08.510 align:start position:0%
okay our second Deborah I'm gonna show
it

03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:41:10.130 --> 03:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
please yes
 
03:41:11.580 --> 03:41:12.469 align:start position:0%
please yes
um

03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'd actually like to be able to
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
OTP this but
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
because I mean representative Gallagher
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
raised some real issues you and and you
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
know I can give a tutorial on this
 
03:41:26.330 --> 03:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
sometime but basically JavaScript is
 
03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
software that's comes is downloaded into
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
your web browser and runs on your
 
03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
your web browser and runs on your
computer

03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
computer
 
03:41:33.410 --> 03:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
and they can say whatever it does or it
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't do but there's no way for you to
 
03:41:36.170 --> 03:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
know what it's doing on your computer
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern so the question is
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
do you trust them or even achieve
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
protect you know information officer or
 
03:41:45.889 --> 03:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
whatever but there's two issues one is I
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know I can quibble over as cost
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
estimates in the FN but I don't think
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're crazy it would be very expensive
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
for them to do it
 
03:41:55.439 --> 03:41:56.210 align:start position:0%
for them to do it
um

03:41:56.210 --> 03:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I I want to know I mean I I could also
 
03:42:01.370 --> 03:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
see doing an amendment to require it
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
going forward but even there I think it
 
03:42:05.870 --> 03:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
would take some investigation to see how
 
03:42:07.849 --> 03:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
much it really would cost
 
03:42:10.130 --> 03:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
what would be the consequences
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as the functionality of the
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
website so given all that
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
for this bill at this point
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
um I'd say itl although you looking into
 
03:42:21.889 --> 03:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
something like this in the future might
 
03:42:25.250 --> 03:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I agree that the the cost kind of
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
startled me
 
03:42:37.250 --> 03:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but I understand the testimony from
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
the I.T Department uh some of the
 
03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind those but I also was
 
03:42:46.809 --> 03:42:46.819 align:start position:0%
concerned because the sponsor himself
 
03:42:49.370 --> 03:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
answered a lot of our questions with I
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
don't know and it made me think that
 
03:42:55.190 --> 03:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
this perhaps wasn't thought out quite as
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
well as it should have been
 
03:43:00.290 --> 03:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay representative Simon
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
thanks it's kind of actually a question
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
for representative like us since you
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
know more about this than I do
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
um is this something that a personal VPN
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
would protect you from even with
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
JavaScript running in the background
 
03:43:12.170 --> 03:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
would essentially
 
03:43:16.610 --> 03:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh no it wouldn't okay and uh if I may
 
03:43:18.889 --> 03:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
no please okay uh a little bit in
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
defense of Representative Gallagher I
 
03:43:22.610 --> 03:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
think at least some of the I don't knows
 
03:43:24.110 --> 03:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
is he doesn't know what the websites
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
State websites are currently doing and
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for him not to know that
 
03:43:27.359 --> 03:43:28.429 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for him not to know that
that's

03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien do you have a
 
03:43:34.319 --> 03:43:38.170 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien do you have a
question

03:43:38.170 --> 03:43:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question
 
03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:41.939 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
 
03:43:43.969 --> 03:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
chair it just seems for me being a
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
carpenter it seems like we have this
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
thing we built this house has asbestos
 
03:43:49.190 --> 03:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
in it and since we already built it
 
03:43:50.690 --> 03:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
initially with some asbestos we're going
 
03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
to keep building more of the house with
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
asbestos and put on extensions because
 
03:43:56.210 --> 03:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
going back and getting the asbestos out
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be a problem I I don't I
 
03:43:59.450 --> 03:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just kind of simplistic
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
here but it doesn't make any sense why
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
we couldn't nip this in the bud at least
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
to stop it from growing more pervasive
 
03:44:07.150 --> 03:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
I I think we ought to write our report
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
such that we say that we think it is a
 
03:44:17.450 --> 03:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
concern and that we hope that it will be
 
03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
considered going forward because we'd
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
rather not do it
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
in in the future particularly if we
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't absolutely have to
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
and we want to know if we are doing it
 
03:44:31.190 --> 03:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
we'd like to know that
 
03:44:33.769 --> 03:44:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative leckis yeah just uh uh
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
briefly on
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
um previous speaker's point it's
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of standard tools used
 
03:44:44.090 --> 03:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
for developing websites a lot of them
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
use JavaScript and so his statement that
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
they might find have trouble finding
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
vendors to to uh to do the work on
 
03:44:54.769 --> 03:44:54.779 align:start position:0%
websites is at least not unreasonable I
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
think it would require a fair you know
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
fair amount of Investigation looking
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
into options and what the cost would be
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
before it would be responsible to say
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know they can't do this going
 
03:45:05.330 --> 03:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
forward or we have to change the
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
existing ones or whatever
 
03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
inexpected to legislate on House Bill
 
03:45:21.050 --> 03:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
327 by representative blackis and the
 
03:45:23.450 --> 03:45:23.460 align:start position:0%

03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
in 18 yay zero nay
 
03:46:18.650 --> 03:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay 18 18-0 the motion passes and the
 
03:46:21.410 --> 03:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
objections to consent
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you we will put this one
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
on consent Madam chair yes if I can just
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
add I I didn't mean to imply that
 
03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:30.410 align:start position:0%
add I I didn't mean to imply that
um

03:46:30.410 --> 03:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsor drafted the bill badly but
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
rather that there were aspects of some
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that were asked about say
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities that he hadn't thought of
 
03:46:46.370 --> 03:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
that was all oh okay so noted
 
03:46:50.690 --> 03:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.929 --> 03:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
okay and we have until 2 P.M
 
03:46:59.929 --> 03:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
all right so next week we've got
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.150 --> 04:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
I tried to get all the software together
 
04:01:10.429 --> 04:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
on one day so we'd only have we could
 
04:01:13.210 --> 04:01:13.220 align:start position:0%
forget it after tomorrow
 
04:01:13.220 --> 04:01:15.250 align:start position:0%
forget it after tomorrow
okay

04:01:15.250 --> 04:01:15.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
all right it is two o'clock I'm opening
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 230 and I call
 
04:01:29.689 --> 04:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative Peter
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
Bixby from Dover and the ranking member
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
of House environment and agriculture
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh the bill before you uh
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the my initial uh recognition of its
 
04:01:51.050 --> 04:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
need came last fall when it was uh on a
 
04:01:53.809 --> 04:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
soil soil conditioner study committee
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
and we were hearing testimony from uh
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the department on uh fertilizer
 
04:02:03.290 --> 04:02:03.300 align:start position:0%
standards and uh one of the things that
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
director Wyman noted was that uh there
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
was a significant drain on his staff
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
time because uh the lack of the lack of
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
Technology uh he has a lot of his staff
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
are doing hand data entry instead of
 
04:02:20.210 --> 04:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
doing things like performing testing on
 
04:02:22.910 --> 04:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh on fertilizers and other regulated
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
products and
 
04:02:25.260 --> 04:02:26.389 align:start position:0%
products and
um

04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
so this seemed like a you know something
 
04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
that needed to be dealt with and the
 
04:02:32.929 --> 04:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
best way would be to provide the
 
04:02:34.849 --> 04:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
technology to the Department of AG
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
markets agriculture markets and Foods
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I discussed it with the department
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
and they said uh it actually made more
 
04:02:46.969 --> 04:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
sense to rather than making it narrowly
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
associated with fertilizers uh make it a
 
04:02:53.889 --> 04:02:53.899 align:start position:0%
request from the Department to
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
establish a data handling system that
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
would basically take care of all of
 
04:03:02.929 --> 04:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
their uh needs for licensing and
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
registrations and and other data that
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
could be easily submitted online
 
04:03:12.290 --> 04:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
but is currently submitted on paper
 
04:03:12.300 --> 04:03:13.809 align:start position:0%
but is currently submitted on paper
so

04:03:13.809 --> 04:03:13.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:18.170 --> 04:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh the uh and one of the points is that
 
04:03:20.210 --> 04:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
that lack of Technology wastes a lot of
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
Staff time in
 
04:03:25.849 --> 04:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
um in all of their divisions and uh you
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
know it would be much better to have
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
trained staff people who know what
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
they're doing with regulation dealing
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
with things like analyzing products and
 
04:03:38.330 --> 04:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
doing inspections when they're needed uh
 
04:03:40.250 --> 04:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
doing the inspections that are actually
 
04:03:42.370 --> 04:03:42.380 align:start position:0%
called for in state law as opposed to
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
occasionally doing them when there is a
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
complaint filed
 
04:03:48.769 --> 04:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
the other another aspect of this is that
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
the lack of Technology makes Department
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
Services more difficult for the people
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
who are being regulated uh if you have
 
04:03:59.929 --> 04:03:59.939 align:start position:0%
to fill things out on paper
 
04:04:03.050 --> 04:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
the uh rather than submitting online it
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
is uh more it's a more tedious process
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and you don't get the results of your
 
04:04:11.929 --> 04:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
registration as soon so uh
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
a product registration can go through
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
much more quickly if it were simple
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
simply submitted online and uh so uh
 
04:04:21.889 --> 04:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
there are also implications for the
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
businesses that are regulated because if
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for you know you know
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
weeks or months for something to get
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
processed rather than a week or two then
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
that delays when you can start acting on
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
what you're registering
 
04:04:39.650 --> 04:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:04:39.660 --> 04:04:40.969 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

04:04:40.969 --> 04:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
the department now has an I.T person uh
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
that was brought on as uh in because of
 
04:04:49.010 --> 04:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
the animal database bill that we passed
 
04:04:50.570 --> 04:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
that passed through the budget last term
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh and that person has been able to uh
 
04:04:56.689 --> 04:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
put together some not the well he was
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
the person who put together the uh the
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
numbers uh in the fiscal note
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh he's mentioned that there are
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
potentially significant efficiencies by
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
using the same vendor for this project
 
04:05:11.809 --> 04:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
as uh is being used for the animal
 
04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
database product project
 
04:05:16.729 --> 04:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note indicates the cost
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
between uh 360
 
04:05:22.250 --> 04:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
000 uh to 500 000 for the initial
 
04:05:26.210 --> 04:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
establishment of the database uh the 360
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
000 that is in the bill was what was
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
quoted to me when I uh was talking with
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
the Department last fall on during
 
04:05:36.050 --> 04:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
filing period uh if it seems that the if
 
04:05:38.570 --> 04:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
it turns out the slightly higher than
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
six three hundred sixty thousand dollar
 
04:05:43.370 --> 04:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
appropriation is needed then it would
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
still be appropriate I think it would be
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to you know provide the
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money needed because in terms
 
04:05:52.849 --> 04:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
of long-term savings and staff time and
 
04:05:55.969 --> 04:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
inefficiency uh that initial upfront
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
capital investment uh it will pay off
 
04:05:58.560 --> 04:05:59.929 align:start position:0%
capital investment uh it will pay off
significantly

04:05:59.929 --> 04:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh and there's an annual maintenance
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
cost of about 200 000 uh and this cost
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
Falls within the range of the fee income
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
from registrations and Licensing and uh
 
04:06:13.490 --> 04:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
it would clearly be an appropriate use
 
04:06:15.650 --> 04:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
of existing fees so that would not
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
require any further uh ongoing
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh and the state has
 
04:06:23.330 --> 04:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
currently has a surplus a budget surplus
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
so this would be a good time for this
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
sort of capital investment
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:06:32.809 --> 04:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do have one
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
general question why is it why is this
 
04:06:37.450 --> 04:06:37.460 align:start position:0%
not in the budget does it
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
well um that would be a question for uh
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper because he had the
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
option of putting in the budget and
 
04:06:48.889 --> 04:06:48.899 align:start position:0%
um he's asked me to put the bill in I
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
did approach the governor yesterday and
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
said and said I had this bill it might
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
make sense to go into the budget and he
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
said send it to me I'll have a look at
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
it so it may go into the budget but
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime uh it it's something
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's is it's important to have it move
 
04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
forward so whichever path it takes
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that it I'd like to see it happen
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:07:17.929 --> 04:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for taking my
 
04:07:17.939 --> 04:07:19.610 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for taking my
question

04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh I like to describing things
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
particularly when a pillow forms with uh
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and stuff like that it
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
seems sometimes a lot of questions get
 
04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
asked and answered uh particularly if
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
there's like uh if the clerk has a
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
problem with my filing okay when you do
 
04:07:41.330 --> 04:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
electronically you file it and they can
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
deny it is there any form of appeal or
 
04:07:48.050 --> 04:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
built into this or any way that a person
 
04:07:51.050 --> 04:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
can come in and explain his point of
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
view I I I assume there would be because
 
04:07:58.250 --> 04:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
the the point of this is simply is so
 
04:07:58.260 --> 04:07:59.389 align:start position:0%
the the point of this is simply is so
that

04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:59.399 --> 04:08:00.290 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
the level of design that is stated in
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
this bill basically means that the
 
04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the department and the vendor set set
 
04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
forward there you know in their RFP what
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to require and based on my
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
experience with the Department of
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture they're good about
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
being accessible to the people who they
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
provide services for so if a person has
 
04:08:26.450 --> 04:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
a question about what they're filming
 
04:08:28.490 --> 04:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
out online I'm sure that they could call
 
04:08:30.170 --> 04:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
the department and get clarification
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
about what needs to happen
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simons
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with the 196
 
04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
000 maintenance fees you said that that
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
would come out of fees um that the
 
04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
department would collect for those new
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
fees no those are existing fees so there
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
is currently there are fees on uh the
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
product registrations for fertilizer for
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
lime uh and also there is a tonnage fee
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
for both of those products uh there are
 
04:09:08.330 --> 04:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
also fees uh registration fees for pet
 
04:09:10.490 --> 04:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
food products for
 
04:09:13.010 --> 04:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
um or and other animal feed products
 
04:09:15.250 --> 04:09:15.260 align:start position:0%
there are registration fees for
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
pesticides and
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm probably I'm sure I'm missing
 
04:09:21.650 --> 04:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
various products that they that they
 
04:09:23.450 --> 04:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
have registrations for but those are
 
04:09:26.689 --> 04:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
existing registration fees and currently
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
the fertilizer uh the proceeds of the
 
04:09:36.650 --> 04:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
fertilizer fees uh runs I'm
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's been about it's been four months
 
04:09:41.330 --> 04:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
since I looked at the numbers but um I'm
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm thinking I'm remembering
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
something like six hundred thousand
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
dollars per year comes in uh from the
 
04:09:51.530 --> 04:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
fertilizer registration fees and that
 
04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
cover end that at this point goes into
 
04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the general fund uh I have another bill
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
that says it should go into a dedicated
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
fund but that's that's coming into a
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
different committee so you don't need to
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
worry about that but that but the
 
04:10:06.110 --> 04:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
terminology but if that other bill
 
04:10:08.330 --> 04:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
passes one of the things that that bill
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
specifies is that it would be available
 
04:10:12.889 --> 04:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien thank
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative picture
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
final one uh as with all software it
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
comes with licensing agreements so is
 
04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
your class based upon the initial just
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the software and will it incur
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
futuristic re-licensing of the product
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh so um the uh the way that the
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner explained it to me was that
 
04:10:43.490 --> 04:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh and and he can explain it to you a
 
04:10:45.530 --> 04:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
little bit further what once he fills
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
out his pick card but
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
um the way he explained it to me was
 
04:10:53.210 --> 04:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
that uh there was an initial cost for
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
the event they're going to secure a a
 
04:11:01.010 --> 04:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
third-party vendor to do both the uh and
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
the the construction of the uh system
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
and to do ongoing maintenance so uh so
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
the uh that the 360
 
04:11:11.399 --> 04:11:12.410 align:start position:0%
the uh that the 360
000

04:11:12.410 --> 04:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
um or or so uh is for that initial
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
establishment of the database and then
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
there would be an annual contract with
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
the venue vendor or I'm not sure what
 
04:11:25.370 --> 04:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
the terms of it might be you know I'm
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
not sure what the renewal terms of the
 
04:11:28.969 --> 04:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
con of that contract would be but there
 
04:11:31.969 --> 04:11:31.979 align:start position:0%
is a long-term contract with a vendor to
 
04:11:35.090 --> 04:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
continue the upkeep of it
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
experience other representative Dolan
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
and then like us
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
04:11:44.450 --> 04:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question as
 
04:11:46.849 --> 04:11:46.859 align:start position:0%
I look at the appropriation
 
04:11:49.010 --> 04:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note of 360
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
000 that to me is a lot of money
 
04:11:52.199 --> 04:11:53.570 align:start position:0%
000 that to me is a lot of money
and

04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:53.580 --> 04:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:00.250 --> 04:12:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of a requests in the
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note of 360
 
04:12:08.570 --> 04:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
000 for this initial purchase seems like
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to me uh what do do I
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
read should I read anything into the
 
04:12:16.570 --> 04:12:16.580 align:start position:0%
fact that there are no other and
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislative endorsements either in the
 
04:12:21.729 --> 04:12:21.739 align:start position:0%
house or the senate for this expenditure
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh no uh this was primarily I I I put
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill in as a department request and
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:12:36.170 --> 04:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what that what is being
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
purchased for that 360 thousand dollars
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh it what is being purchased is the
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
available staff time is many many uh
 
04:12:50.330 --> 04:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalents of Staff time uh
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
that are currently being used by as on
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
as data entry which can be used for
 
04:12:57.300 --> 04:12:58.450 align:start position:0%
as data entry which can be used for
skilled

04:12:58.450 --> 04:12:58.460 align:start position:0%
skilled
 
04:13:00.650 --> 04:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
skilled work which is what those people
 
04:13:04.729 --> 04:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
should be doing and there are
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
there are a number of statutory
 
04:13:09.650 --> 04:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
requirements which are being done at a
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
bare minimum at best because the staff
 
04:13:17.689 --> 04:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
timing is being occupied by the uh by
 
04:13:21.889 --> 04:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
doing data entry uh and so what we're
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
doing with that 360
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
04:13:36.110 --> 04:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um so looking at lines nine
 
04:13:37.969 --> 04:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
and ten you have in their authorized
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
users shall be capable of working in
 
04:13:41.330 --> 04:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
offline mode when an internet connection
 
04:13:43.849 --> 04:13:43.859 align:start position:0%
is not available I mean that's kind of
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
an unusual requirement and it might add
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
to the cost the whole thing is there
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
some specific aspect of how this is used
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
or the users that would require that yes
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
so uh because a number of the people who
 
04:14:02.769 --> 04:14:02.779 align:start position:0%
are registering uh products or licensing
 
04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
may be in areas that are not well served
 
04:14:09.050 --> 04:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
by internet uh
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
the the that that we feel that that
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
would um that that would be uh a an
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
important aspect to have available uh
 
04:14:23.090 --> 04:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
and uh this that mechanism has was
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
employed uh in or will be employed in
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
the animal records database uh for which
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
it was even more important because you
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
have you you sometimes you know a
 
04:14:36.290 --> 04:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
veterinarian may be doing a licensing of
 
04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
or an inspection of an animal in a place
 
04:14:41.689 --> 04:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
where in an absolute dead zone and we
 
04:14:44.090 --> 04:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
have a lot of dead zones in the rural
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
parts of the State uh so uh in order to
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody who is
 
04:14:51.779 --> 04:14:52.670 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody who is
um

04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:54.769 --> 04:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
who would need to have access to this
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
would not be impeded by occasional inter
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
internet deficiencies uh that was that
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
was the logic behind putting that in
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:15:06.889 --> 04:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
the quotient
 
04:15:09.290 --> 04:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.250 --> 04:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chairman members of
 
04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
the committee I am Sean Jasper
 
04:15:27.889 --> 04:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:15:31.010 --> 04:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food come over
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the department and I can
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
welcome you to the 1980s technology we
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
deploy in and I'm quite serious about
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
about that our weights and measures
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
program was actually uh
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
developed by a sex offender at the New
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Prison in 1984.
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and there's no longer any support for
 
04:15:54.000 --> 04:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
um and there's no longer any support for
that

04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
system so uh it's about to crash and
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
burn and we may not even be able to wait
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
for this and we have
 
04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
tried for five years there was a
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
contract to replace that was awarded
 
04:16:10.250 --> 04:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
before I became commissioner
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately uh
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
they didn't realize what they were
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
getting into and I can't take any blame
 
04:16:20.150 --> 04:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't there but there was
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
certainly a lack of communications about
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
what was going on there and we were
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
trying to straighten that out but that
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
will be an additional cost to the
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
contract if we can do it through the
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
contractor what we're trying to do here
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
is is bring the rest of the department
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
into the 20th century my
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
my joke and it's only partially a joke
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
since I became commissioner somewhat
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
over five years ago was that by the time
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
I retired I'd hoped to bring us into the
 
04:16:49.439 --> 04:16:51.130 align:start position:0%
I retired I'd hoped to bring us into the
1990s

04:16:51.130 --> 04:16:51.140 align:start position:0%
1990s
 
04:16:54.889 --> 04:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually help us get to
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
where we need to be
 
04:16:59.929 --> 04:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
we have the animal
 
04:16:59.939 --> 04:17:00.590 align:start position:0%
we have the animal
um

04:17:00.590 --> 04:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
database that was approved and that that
 
04:17:05.570 --> 04:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
we still don't know what it's going to
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
be that's funded through our
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
um our own funds I think it we expect it
 
04:17:14.929 --> 04:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
may be as high as a million dollars but
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
why the rest of this could be more
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
effective is we took the extra time in
 
04:17:19.859 --> 04:17:20.889 align:start position:0%
effective is we took the extra time in
writing

04:17:20.889 --> 04:17:20.899 align:start position:0%
writing
 
04:17:25.370 --> 04:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
that proposal which is now live it just
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
went live I think last week or the week
 
04:17:32.090 --> 04:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
before we put into that request
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the requirements that we have for the
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
rest of the department so that should
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
make it much more cost effective and I
 
04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
understand what people say you know this
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money but there are six
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
different divisions in the department
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
with different needs although some of
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
them the same ways and weights and
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
measures is is substantially different
 
04:17:57.410 --> 04:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
but our I.T lead is here to testify he's
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
embedded in the department that finally
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
happened and I suspect this is why we
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
are still in some cases in the 1980s we
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
were sort of left out there to dry by
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves no one in the department being
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
an expert in I.T and while doit you know
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
helped us along they were doing nothing
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
really to help us prepare for the future
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
they were just dealing with our
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
immediate needs for computers and
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
laptops and and things like that and not
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
saying hey you really need to get on
 
04:18:29.450 --> 04:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
board and no one else knew what was what
 
04:18:31.490 --> 04:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
was going on so having an I.T lead has
 
04:18:34.490 --> 04:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
made a difference we
 
04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
I won't say We'll lay anybody off
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
because that's not going to happen but
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
we will be able to do more of what the
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked us to do when I
 
04:18:46.130 --> 04:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
became commissioner uh
 
04:18:48.410 --> 04:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner Merrill told me we were in
 
04:18:49.849 --> 04:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
triage mode
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
I soon realized just how true that was
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've moved away from that to a degree
 
04:18:57.370 --> 04:18:57.380 align:start position:0%
but if I look at all of the statutory
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that the legislature has
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
placed upon us we are far from where we
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
should be in freeing up staff time is
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
Key to that I don't want to go out and
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
hire more people
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
particularly until I understand what our
 
04:19:14.210 --> 04:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
needs actually are when we have the
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
proper technology in place and so this
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
is imperative for us to uh to get up to
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
speed and get out of the 1980s
 
04:19:25.250 --> 04:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions that I can
 
04:19:27.530 --> 04:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
but the technical guy is behind me and
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
will be testifying next okay thank you
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell us what
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
portion of the economy in New Hampshire
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
is uh does farming and agriculture
 
04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
contribute to
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you I can't tell you that
 
04:19:49.070 --> 04:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a study on that in in
 
04:19:49.080 --> 04:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a study on that in in
years

04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
um all told it's a rather large sector
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the economy what I can tell you is
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Agriculture
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
does not take from the general fund now
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
we put money in we have some that stays
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
in our funds but when you look at the
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
total revenues that we generate
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
we run between 200 000 and somewhat over
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a year positive so we
 
04:20:19.370 --> 04:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
are a we're not asking really for money
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
from the general fund we're asking for
 
04:20:23.809 --> 04:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
money that we have put into the general
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
fund so that we can do a better job with
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
what you've asked us to do thank you
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is a this represents services to a
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
major portion of contributing
 
04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
um workers in our state to the economy
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and what I'm hearing is that
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be able to do this
 
04:20:52.130 --> 04:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
remotely and not have to go into the
 
04:20:52.140 --> 04:20:52.969 align:start position:0%
remotely and not have to go into the
office

04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
would be a convenience for for farmers
 
04:20:55.979 --> 04:20:57.010 align:start position:0%
would be a convenience for for farmers
and

04:20:57.010 --> 04:20:57.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
largely what happens is they're not
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
coming in they're sending us paper
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay and then we're taking that paper
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
and we've got somebody there typing
 
04:21:08.330 --> 04:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
things in
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you know terrible waste of Human
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
Resources when things should be
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
automatically entered rather than the
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
people filling out paper forms
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
we want them to be able to put it in
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
directly online and take out all of that
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
unnecessary work it doesn't take them
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
any more time takes us a lot more time
 
04:21:27.479 --> 04:21:28.429 align:start position:0%
any more time takes us a lot more time
so

04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:28.439 --> 04:21:30.110 align:start position:0%
so
yes

04:21:30.110 --> 04:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:21:32.650 --> 04:21:32.660 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:21:38.330 --> 04:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
so I don't come close to fully
 
04:21:40.729 --> 04:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
understanding how the I.T infrastructure
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the state is handled
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
but um you know I'm sure the the
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
department has expertise and it's
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
actually first I want to say welcome uh
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh The Honorable Sean Chester he was my
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative one of my representatives
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
for many years but uh
 
04:21:56.520 --> 04:21:57.650 align:start position:0%
for many years but uh
um

04:21:57.650 --> 04:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:57.660 --> 04:22:00.530 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know I would not expect the
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to have
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
much expertise in managing software
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
projects and just having one it employee
 
04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
is not
 
04:22:13.969 --> 04:22:13.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't help a lot in that regard so my
 
04:22:15.410 --> 04:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the impression I get from the fiscal
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
note is that that and from what you says
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
the Department's actually managing this
 
04:22:25.010 --> 04:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
project is that true and if so why isn't
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's doit I mean we had
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
the CIO in here earlier for another bill
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
why aren't they involved in managing the
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
project I would have expected that the
 
04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture would just
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
provide expertise on the process and
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else would actually implement
 
04:22:43.080 --> 04:22:44.090 align:start position:0%
somebody else would actually implement
this

04:22:44.090 --> 04:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:45.769 --> 04:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and my
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
apologies for not being clear Joe
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
Bentley who is behind here and will be
 
04:22:54.050 --> 04:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
testifying works for dlit he is now in
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the department full-time so he resides
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
there so he is doing all this work he
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
put the numbers together he has been
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
going around spending time with all the
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
division heads
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
finding out what their needs are and
 
04:23:10.610 --> 04:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
then developing everything to do it so
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
they finally are doing that for us that
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
only came across because it came to be
 
04:23:18.050 --> 04:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
because of the scope of the animal
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
database which was approved some time
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
ago and
 
04:23:26.150 --> 04:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
um is now finally out out to bid but yes
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
they are doing that because we have no
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
expertise and you know it's
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
it's a like a a new world for us
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh question commissioner
 
04:23:45.180 --> 04:23:46.849 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh question commissioner
uh

04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't by the way I don't claim to be
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
anywhere near an expert on agriculture
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
but what I'm hearing is an emergency
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
call for action
 
04:24:01.729 --> 04:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
I could describe your your testimony
 
04:24:03.729 --> 04:24:03.739 align:start position:0%
back to me that's what I'm hearing
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
particular yes thank you thank you for
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
the question that is particularly true
 
04:24:11.330 --> 04:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
in in weights and measures and if that
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
system crashes we don't know what we're
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
going to do it's been band-aided
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
together this is part of it
 
04:24:18.889 --> 04:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
but if there is a crash between now and
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
then we might have to do something
 
04:24:27.530 --> 04:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.540 --> 04:24:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
12

04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
12
 
04:24:32.410 --> 04:24:32.420 align:start position:0%
000 pesticides registrations a year
 
04:24:35.929 --> 04:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
entering stuff in we do
 
04:24:35.939 --> 04:24:37.490 align:start position:0%
entering stuff in we do
20

04:24:37.490 --> 04:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
000 feed products entered in by hand so
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
there's you know just all over the place
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's all the people who who come in
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
um licensed
 
04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
to uh to apply pesticides licensed as
 
04:24:54.769 --> 04:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
you know plant dealers and and we're
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
just way behind the time it's just you
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
know follow-up
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair so so I'm
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
hearing that emergency call for action
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
however as you know especially in your
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
background uh the the way we do things
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
is often through collaborative support
 
04:25:17.450 --> 04:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
for each other especially when issues
 
04:25:19.610 --> 04:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
and emergencies
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
present themselves and uh what
 
04:25:26.150 --> 04:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby brought us is a is
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
a bill that has zero co-sponsors either
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the senate or in the house and I feel
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
bad for him because I feel like he's
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
been left out to dry a little bit on
 
04:25:35.640 --> 04:25:37.370 align:start position:0%
been left out to dry a little bit on
this

04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:25:40.969 --> 04:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
and so we've got to rely on that and I'd
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
like to be able to look at co-sponsors
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
and and see them all knowing their head
 
04:25:46.250 --> 04:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
up and down this is we really got to
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
lean out and do this to help out the
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
department uh I don't see that so can
 
04:25:53.689 --> 04:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
you explain what happened the fact that
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
we we don't have uh this collaborative
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
force of co-sponsors
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
um well sometimes that happens some
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't often in the case
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
of a request from an agency
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
there isn't that that Outreach that
 
04:26:10.380 --> 04:26:11.269 align:start position:0%
there isn't that that Outreach that
really

04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:26:11.279 --> 04:26:12.710 align:start position:0%
really
had

04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
felt the need I probably could have
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
reached out to to some people generally
 
04:26:21.410 --> 04:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
the sponsors reach out to others but
 
04:26:23.570 --> 04:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
this sort of came together at the last
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
at the last minute I think and and I
 
04:26:28.010 --> 04:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
would ask you not to look at the the
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
lack of co-sponsors as indicative of of
 
04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
the need or the crisis I mean we don't
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
work on a general basis that closely
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
with a lot of of legislators
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
um last session uh it was really rep now
 
04:26:46.750 --> 04:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl who we worked with he was
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
on a number of our bills this year who I
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
04:26:54.530 --> 04:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and representative Bixby those have
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
been our two go-to people in the in the
 
04:26:59.570 --> 04:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
house we really didn't have a go-to
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
person in the Senate before so most of
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
our bills were really uh developed in in
 
04:27:06.889 --> 04:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
the house and I can't speak to how many
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors were on on there but we have
 
04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
a relatively small pool of of people who
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
we we go to who understand the issues
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and have helped us greatly thank
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh commission it's good to see you again
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
good to see you um
 
04:27:31.610 --> 04:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
just seems so much like a bread and
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
butter issue and I understand working
 
04:27:35.170 --> 04:27:35.180 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
municipality and the benefits of
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids but why did you not put it
 
04:27:42.889 --> 04:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
into the budget you know trying to get
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
in and I think some it was a question
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
asked before you came in the room and
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
I'll give you the opportunity to clear
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:27:51.239 --> 04:27:52.610 align:start position:0%
that up
yes

04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
um because we are given parameters by
 
04:27:56.450 --> 04:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
04:27:56.460 --> 04:27:57.950 align:start position:0%
the governor
and

04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
our budget requests also started
 
04:28:05.450 --> 04:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
um back in September
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
and Joe when did you come on board
 
04:28:11.210 --> 04:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
he came on in June and was getting his
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
feet wet and the the first thing was to
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
worry about the animal database and
 
04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
learning about that
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
my understanding from talking to others
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard this directly from the
 
04:28:21.720 --> 04:28:23.170 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard this directly from the
governor's

04:28:23.170 --> 04:28:23.180 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
staff at this time they may actually be
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
considering putting this in the in the
 
04:28:33.110 --> 04:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
budget personally I'm a little bit
 
04:28:34.969 --> 04:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
afraid of that I've been around for too
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
many budget processes to know that bills
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
become law very often long before
 
04:28:42.250 --> 04:28:42.260 align:start position:0%
budgets become law
 
04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I feel a lot safer actually having
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
this as an independent Bill rather than
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
getting tied up with the possibility of
 
04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
a budget which you know may go to a
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution may go on until
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
the Lord only knows when I'd rather have
 
04:29:02.090 --> 04:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
something that takes effect July 1st for
 
04:29:02.100 --> 04:29:03.769 align:start position:0%
something that takes effect July 1st for
sure

04:29:03.769 --> 04:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up how distrustful of you
 
04:29:06.300 --> 04:29:07.790 align:start position:0%
follow-up how distrustful of you
commissioner

04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
just experience
 
04:29:13.130 --> 04:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
so commissioner then in Reading between
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the lines of what you said Fair answer
 
04:29:17.570 --> 04:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh the support of this committee would
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
probably assist
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh the governor and to uh making a wise
 
04:29:26.090 --> 04:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
choice I would I would hope so I would
 
04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
certainly you know ask and hope that
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
this this committee realizes that we
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
have sort of been the uh the stepchild
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
of departments uh when it comes to RIT
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
needs for decades
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and that's nobody's fault outside of
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
the department but within the department
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
nobody to blame because you don't know
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
what you don't know and I think a lot of
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
us assumed in erroneously so that doit
 
04:29:57.050 --> 04:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
would see what our needs were and would
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
put us in the queue for things and since
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
I've become more educated on things
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
things I realized that's not how it it
 
04:30:07.370 --> 04:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
happens it's sort of like being your
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
your own Advocate with your doctor
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's what you have to be and
 
04:30:12.649 --> 04:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we were not very good at
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:19.490 --> 04:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative thank
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
you um just a clarification there was a
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
implication that
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
this system would would among other
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
things replace the weights and measures
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
one is that correct it it is the numbers
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
have been developed that way yes
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that it is included it is included in
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
here it looks like there's you know it's
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
a fairly expensive part the rest of what
 
04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
is out there may be more off the shelf
 
04:30:50.570 --> 04:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
um Mr Bentley can speak better to to
 
04:30:53.090 --> 04:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
those issues than I can he developed the
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
numbers understanding the needs and
 
04:31:00.889 --> 04:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
believe me I am no I T person a quick
 
04:31:03.769 --> 04:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yeah it just uh my
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
concern was whether this bill and this
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
um the cost here did include weights and
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
measures and I'm glad to hear that it
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
does thank you okay any other questions
 
04:31:16.130 --> 04:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:31:19.550 --> 04:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon commissioner
 
04:31:21.479 --> 04:31:22.189 align:start position:0%
good afternoon commissioner
um

04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
so if I understand correctly uh this is
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
an early bill
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay so our call here is to make the
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
policy decision the financial side will
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
be just determined if it passes the
 
04:31:40.490 --> 04:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
house on our recommendation as to policy
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee will have a
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
go at it to consider and determine the
 
04:31:49.250 --> 04:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
financial end of things and to some
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
degree maybe in Ways and Means because
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
it certainly will be Revenue raising in
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
in some fashion so
 
04:31:56.040 --> 04:31:56.689 align:start position:0%
in some fashion so
um

04:31:56.689 --> 04:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
if I if I recall correctly when I served
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
on environment and agriculture committee
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
17 years ago
 
04:32:06.050 --> 04:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
agriculture in those days represented
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
about one-fifth of the New Hampshire
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
economy would you say that it is likely
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
comparable in this day and age
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
I really don't want to comment on that
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
because I I honestly don't know when you
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
take all of Agriculture as as a whole
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a large sector
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
um but I didn't come here with with any
 
04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
of those numbers prepared and I'm not
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
sure that there are any that are up to
 
04:32:34.090 --> 04:32:34.100 align:start position:0%
date at the moment but it certainly does
 
04:32:37.250 --> 04:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
have a large well what my follow-up
 
04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
question if I may Madam chair would be
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh in in any case it's a significant
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
part of the New Hampshire economy and
 
04:32:47.570 --> 04:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
it's not functioning as well they your
 
04:32:49.490 --> 04:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
department is not functioning as well as
 
04:32:53.450 --> 04:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
it could if it were in the 2000s instead
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
of in the 1980s
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
and therefore would it not be uh your
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
request that the policy committee weigh
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
in in favor of this bill you're here in
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
support I take it I am in a hundred
 
04:33:09.769 --> 04:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
percent agreement with your statements
 
04:33:12.410 --> 04:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you very much
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
I couldn't have stated that better
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
just a quick question for the chair
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
well I look at this bill and it deals
 
04:33:26.510 --> 04:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
with electronic licensing certification
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
and registration I don't believe it's
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
the licensing registration and
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
certification that this committee
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
generally deals with correct that's
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
correct if I had looked at this more
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
closely we might have tried to uh vacate
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
I mean from a policy point of view it's
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
not necessarily our well I don't know we
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
do license weights and measures
 
04:33:50.939 --> 04:33:53.390 align:start position:0%
do license weights and measures
inspectors

04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
um which is apparently the largest part
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.609 --> 04:34:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.570 --> 04:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
so yeah and really representative Gould
 
04:34:10.131 --> 04:34:10.141 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick one
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner for taking my
 
04:34:13.609 --> 04:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
question so when we talk about the
 
04:34:15.890 --> 04:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
portion of the economy that's
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
um Farm labor and I understand you can't
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
give numbers then we talk about weights
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
and measures weights and measures also
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
covers like firewood and lumber is that
 
04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
correct yes and and thank you you make
 
04:34:30.289 --> 04:34:30.299 align:start position:0%
make an excellent point because this is
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
more than agriculture because when you
 
04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:34:34.260 --> 04:34:36.429 align:start position:0%
look at
um pesticides

04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
um pesticides
 
04:34:39.769 --> 04:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
most I shouldn't say most but thousands
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
and thousands of homeowners are involved
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
in that by hiring companies to come in
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
treat their lawns take care of insects
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's outside of the traditional
 
04:34:54.051 --> 04:34:54.061 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and we service all those
 
04:34:56.209 --> 04:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
people and license all of those products
 
04:34:59.449 --> 04:34:59.459 align:start position:0%
same is true of weights and measures
 
04:34:59.459 --> 04:35:00.289 align:start position:0%
same is true of weights and measures
um

04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:03.470 --> 04:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
virtually every single thing that is
 
04:35:06.109 --> 04:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
sold by a weight or measure from
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
firewood to the beer in your
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
refrigerator we have oversight on I I
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
thought you'd like that representative
 
04:35:16.970 --> 04:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
O'Brien so you know those are the those
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
are the things that we have over
 
04:35:22.189 --> 04:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
oversight on we've been dealing with a
 
04:35:25.070 --> 04:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
candy company who was not
 
04:35:29.449 --> 04:35:29.459 align:start position:0%
taking off the weight of the lollipop
 
04:35:32.631 --> 04:35:32.641 align:start position:0%
step sticks in wrappers known as tear
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
so even your lollipops you know we're
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with that and protecting you
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
from having to pay for those paper
 
04:35:40.570 --> 04:35:40.580 align:start position:0%
wrappers and weights and measures
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's always amazing
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
to people when they find out what we
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
actually are in in charge of overseeing
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
um just what a large footprint we have
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire you
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
virtually you know of course the gas
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
pumps there is virtually nothing that
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
you probably do in a week
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
or you probably can't go a week without
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
um buying something that we are uh that
 
04:36:11.890 --> 04:36:11.900 align:start position:0%
we're not in charge of because
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
food in the grocery store by volume all
 
04:36:17.810 --> 04:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
of those things so we have a very large
 
04:36:17.820 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
of those things so we have a very large
footprint

04:36:20.240 --> 04:36:20.250 align:start position:0%
footprint
 
04:36:20.250 --> 04:36:23.330 align:start position:0%
footprint
[Music]

04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
all right yeah I'd like to mention to
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
the committee that as representative
 
04:36:30.890 --> 04:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
goalie pointed out this is not our usual
 
04:36:32.650 --> 04:36:32.660 align:start position:0%
type of
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
licensing but I mean and the cost
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
basically they're covering it from the
 
04:36:40.570 --> 04:36:40.580 align:start position:0%
the existing fees so
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't worry too much whether it's
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand or three hundred
 
04:36:46.730 --> 04:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
thousand or half a million because you
 
04:36:51.410 --> 04:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%

04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you madam chair as an
 
04:39:21.410 --> 04:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
organic farmer and and coming from
 
04:39:23.689 --> 04:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
Warner where we have in water and
 
04:39:25.131 --> 04:39:25.141 align:start position:0%
Bradford in our district there are a lot
 
04:39:27.051 --> 04:39:27.061 align:start position:0%
of organic farmers young farmers who are
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
working really hard and being the wife
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
of a logger
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the need for us to
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
pay attention to what the Department of
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
Agriculture needs and
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I feel that the organic farmers
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
waiting for certification for or for
 
04:39:45.890 --> 04:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
organic status those kind of matters are
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
much more important the data entry so
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy to see this bill and
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
happy to move for ought to pass
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you represent goalie
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair after listening to
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
the testimony and hearing about the
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
Antiquated system that they have over
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
there and the dire need for an upgrade
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh money well spent and
 
04:40:12.770 --> 04:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
seeing that it will be at no cost and
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to be used used by um
 
04:40:18.770 --> 04:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
money that the department is already
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
generating I think this is a wise
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
investment all right does anyone else
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
have a comment question
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas I guess my only
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
editorial one is I don't consider it no
 
04:40:32.630 --> 04:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
cost I mean the money's coming in it's
 
04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
going in the general fund so it can be
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
used for something and if it's spent on
 
04:40:37.490 --> 04:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
this it can't be spent on something else
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
but I I will be voting for this you're
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
totally correct
 
04:40:45.530 --> 04:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay any other representative Dolan
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I still I'm a
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
little concerned that an expenditure of
 
04:40:54.410 --> 04:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
this amount is not in the budget and has
 
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
not been vetted by any of our colleagues
 
04:40:59.930 --> 04:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of co-sponsoring well this is
 
04:41:02.448 --> 04:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
an early Bill and it is going to finance
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I can assure you they will vet every
 
04:41:04.920 --> 04:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
and I can assure you they will vet every
dollar

04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:41:08.270 --> 04:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the cost of the software
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%

04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
we are the policy committee not the
 
04:41:23.090 --> 04:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
finance committee our charge is whether
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
this is a wise step for the state to
 
04:41:29.530 --> 04:41:29.540 align:start position:0%
take that the money is not our business
 
04:41:32.330 --> 04:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's what the finance committee will
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
decide if and when the bill passes the
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
house so I invite in case you have not
 
04:41:40.610 --> 04:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
been over there go across the street and
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%

welcome to the 1800s okay they are
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
behind the times with regard to
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
technology and and and when I was on the
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%

04:41:59.770 --> 04:41:59.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tour a number of farms
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
specialty farms and so forth agriculture
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
is is holding its own in the state of
 
04:42:07.570 --> 04:42:07.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're not growing corn
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's for Iowa and Illinois in the
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
midwest but we are producing a lot of
 
04:42:17.810 --> 04:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
specialty goods and I I don't think that
 
04:42:17.820 --> 04:42:18.590 align:start position:0%
specialty goods and I I don't think that
the

04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
percentage of the economy of the State
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that was represented 17
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
years ago which was about a fifth of the
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
economy has declined substantially and
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
it could be doing a lot better if the
 
04:42:36.890 --> 04:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
department could get out of the 1800s so
 
04:42:38.930 --> 04:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
I will be enthusiastically supporting
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
this Bill yes and representative Dolan
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly true that money is is
 
04:42:47.448 --> 04:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
not our concern work
 
04:42:51.730 --> 04:42:51.740 align:start position:0%
Our concern should be that the money is
 
04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the type of thing that
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're doing we don't need to worry
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's three hundred thousand or
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand we need to say
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's significantly less than the amount
 
04:43:06.770 --> 04:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
of fees they bring in and it requires no
 
04:43:08.810 --> 04:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
additional staff
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then we'll let the finance committee
 
04:43:14.208 --> 04:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
sweat the details of how of whether the
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
you know the what the price is
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
but you know the previous Bill we looked
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
at the at the cost and said
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
that is a massive amount of Manpower
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to ask the state to
 
04:43:28.260 --> 04:43:30.050 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to ask the state to
spend

04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
spend
 
04:43:30.060 --> 04:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
spend
it

04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
whereas in this case it's it's not so
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative shuitt

um particularly with an appreciation for
 
04:43:52.490 --> 04:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's comments about fears
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
of putting something like this in the
 
04:43:54.660 --> 04:43:55.810 align:start position:0%
of putting something like this in the
budget

04:43:55.810 --> 04:43:55.820 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
those of us have been around a while
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
know that anything that goes in the
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
budget is subject to the whims of a
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes very important things get
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
cut out when deals are cut when the
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
final budget is is established by that
 
04:44:16.610 --> 04:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference so I can
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the commissioner was
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
saying and hoping that this can go
 
04:44:24.410 --> 04:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
