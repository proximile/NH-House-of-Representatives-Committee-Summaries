00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
into recess for about five minutes we're
 
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for one Committee Member to join
 
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.229 align:start position:0%
waiting for one Committee Member to join
us

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
we are now at a recess
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who'd like to speak on
 
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
out of recess
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
here yeah
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
let me check
 
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
good morning Paul I'm in the hand
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess I we want to just kind of
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
hear the conversation if you have any
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
questions we're here to answer your
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
questions that you heard our testimony
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
last week we
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm very supportive of the
 
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.889 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm very supportive of the
concept

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
um outlined in in Senate Bill 58 as far
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
as how we get to yes I think is where
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
we're why we're here today and we
 
00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
certainly want um to ensure that all
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are heard but the goal is
 
00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are heard but the goal is
to

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that our health care workers are
 
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.930 align:start position:0%
ensure that our health care workers are
protected

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
protected
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
um in these situations that have been
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
described so I'm happy to answer any
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
questions and John Patty from CMC is
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
also here who's in charge of security
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
um so can talk from a security officer
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
perspective but we're just really
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we can pass something that
 
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:24.740 align:start position:0%
can can protect our health care workers
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions from the
 
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.090 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions from the
committee

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
I know you had some ideas on how to get
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
I believe your first name is John
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
I do have a few questions for you if you
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
so is okay got it it's good
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions I have is you're
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
from CMC yes sir how do your security
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel handle uh excuse let me read
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
back that up is your security Personnel
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
in-house yes and they are not licensed
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
through the state they're under the
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
exemption for security guard licensing
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
what kind of training do your
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
individuals receive or do you mandate
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
so we we go through a 120 hour field
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
training so you know new employee will
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
get 40 hours on each shift to go through
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know our policies and procedures
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
learning the hospital
 
00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
typical training you would get for any
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
organization but then we have
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
um use of force training you know we do
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
carry equipment with us we carry
 
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.430 align:start position:0%
carry equipment with us we carry
handcuffs

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
handcuffs
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
pepper gel and tasers
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
so we go through a required training on
 
00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:00.019 align:start position:0%
that and then we have annual
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
recertification for that training as
 
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.949 align:start position:0%
recertification for that training as
well

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
so you maintain certifications for any
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
use of forest techniques that you use
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
anyone have any other questions
 
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
anyone have any other questions
yes

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
when there is an incident in uh in an
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
emergency room an incident like the the
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
ones we've been talking about in in this
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
hearing and others
 
00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.129 align:start position:0%
hearing and others
um

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:27.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
what are uh security Personnel
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
instructed to do and and what are the
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
medical personnel themselves instructed
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
so you know instructed so our first
 
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.389 align:start position:0%
so you know instructed so our first
um

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
our our main goal obviously is that
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
safety of the staff and the patient
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
right so when there are instances when
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
there are physical assaults we're asked
 
00:16:56.339 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
there are physical assaults we're asked
to

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
I would I would say
 
00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:03.410 align:start position:0%
I would I would say
um

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
maintain the order in the room right
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
because there are other
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
not only are we concerned with the
 
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.090 align:start position:0%
not only are we concerned with the
um

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
patient involved and the clinical staff
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
member involved but there's other people
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
in that area as well so we have to make
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
sure that the area is safe for them
 
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:21.260 align:start position:0%
right so you know we do have
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
statutory protection to maintain that
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
safety and decorum in there which is
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
something that we had sought a few years
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
ago and
 
00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:32.179 align:start position:0%
was passed so we have that protection
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
but clearly our role as Security is to
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
maintain the safety of everybody
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
involved so if that includes you know
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
physical Force non-deadly physical Force
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
and the medical personnel themselves uh
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
so I know this isn't something that uh
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that people like to think about but
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
from what I understand this is a fairly
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
common occurrence in emergency rooms and
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
hospitals these days
 
00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:07.010 align:start position:0%
hospitals these days
um

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
how do you instruct a doctor or a nurse
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
who is
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
either concerned about being assaulted
 
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.610 align:start position:0%
either concerned about being assaulted
or

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
um or who
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
may find themselves in the position of
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
being assaulted by a patient
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
sure so we would like to take a
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
proactive approach you know if we if we
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
I say we if a clinician suspects that
 
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:32.900 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
a concern with the behavior of a patient
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
they will ask for us to stand by but as
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know anybody knows just from
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
common sense and living right these
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
situations are volatile and can you know
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
erupt at any moment so we would always
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
ask for them to take a proactive
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
approach and ask for us to be there
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
however in in the event when something
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
happens and it's not expected we have
 
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.409 align:start position:0%
happens and it's not expected we have
certain

00:18:59.409 --> 00:18:59.419 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that the medical
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
staff would follow to call for our
 
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:12.890 align:start position:0%
staff would follow to call for our
assistance

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
and what specifically are they
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
instructed to do
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
so so we have um you know overhead
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
codes that can be called
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
um we also carry
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
um mobile safety pendants right so that
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
um you know in the old commercial I've
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
fallen I can't get up type of thing
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
um Fury call
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know probably eight years ago no
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
probably nine or ten years ago now the
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
um nurse at the Elliott Hospital who was
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
severely injured
 
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.529 align:start position:0%
severely injured
um

00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
by a mental health patient
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
um he was trying to get to a static
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
alarm on the wall and couldn't get it so
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
when I got the CMC we implemented this
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
mobile pendant so that they can carry it
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
with them so if there's an event they
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
can press this and it alerts
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
um Communications to what the problem is
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
and where we're made aware of it to
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
respond there so you know they they have
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
they have options that they can take
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
um you know again proactive is the best
 
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
approach approach however when that
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
can't happen we do have policies in
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
um so I'm assuming that since you have
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the the mobile pendants uh security
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
officer is not always present in areas
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
like the emergency room
 
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
so we try to be you know depending on
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
Staffing levels and calls for service
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the organization
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we do
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know roughly 40 000 calls you know
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
for security every year so you know
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're busy based on you know our FTE so
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're not always available there um it
 
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:54.620 align:start position:0%
is one of our
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
assigned posts from
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
noon to midnight
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
um you know other organizations have
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
different Staffing structures that they
 
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.930 align:start position:0%
different Staffing structures that they
use

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:04.940 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:08.299 align:start position:0%
but we also are responsible for
 
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:11.900 align:start position:0%
safety in our Annex which is where the
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
iea patients are held so where whenever
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have an IA patient our resources are
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
directed to that
 
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.950 align:start position:0%
directed to that
area

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome hey trying to ask whether
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're the staff is instructed to
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
evacuate or fight is that what you're
 
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:33.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily I'm trying to figure out
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
where we're going I think I think part
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
of it is we've all sort of seen stuff
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
like this on TV but how things play out
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
on TV isn't necessarily the way that
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
they they play out in reality so I think
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I was just trying to
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
understand was just I'm just trying to
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
have a better mental picture of
 
00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:56.179 align:start position:0%
um of
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
how security personnel and medical staff
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
are are supposed to react when something
 
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:03.980 align:start position:0%
like this goes down
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
and and I think that'll help us inform
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we do here today
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
um

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
you know so if you picture you know an
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
emergency room whatever size we have 26
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
rooms right so it's not possible
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
possible for us to be you know in every
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
spot at every time
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you know with these situations going
 
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.529 align:start position:0%
um you know with these situations going
on

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
at different moments you know we could
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
be dealing with it with an issue you
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
know one side of the Ed you know when
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
something happens on the other side
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
right so you know we're not no Ed is big
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
enough where you can't hear you know
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
what's going on so there could be a yell
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know you know some security right so
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know that message gets passed down
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
right so it's just that we're not always
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
available at that moment to be in the
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
sure one more question
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
um do you typically have security
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
cameras in areas like that where you can
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
go back afterwards and track through uh
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
what happened or is there a patient uh
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and issue that we need
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be aware of there as well yeah so
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a that's a delicate balance yes of
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
course we can't have cameras in the in
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
the patient care setting so it depends
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
on where in the hospital this may happen
 
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.370 align:start position:0%
on where in the hospital this may happen
yeah

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you and
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh you
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that there was an RSA
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
change or a bill that passed a few years
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
ago that allows hospital security uh
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
justification for physical force and
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
detaining people
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
how would this build so your that's
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
already authorized this bill would
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
specifically allow non-security
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel doctors uh nurses and whatnot
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
those same protections as am I
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly is that how
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
you see this bill
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that language you know in this
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
particular bill I think was added
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
because it seemed to match the language
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the statute that it's trying to be
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
placed under right
 
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.010 align:start position:0%
placed under right
um

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
we don't need that
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
level of
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
Authority right you know so we we have
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
the authority to detain and maintain
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
safety and decorum anyway so that
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
language isn't in there and I think it's
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
taking away from the intention of this
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill right the intention is to give the
 
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.529 align:start position:0%
bill right the intention is to give the
police

00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
more clarity to come in and make that
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest when the situation
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
presents itself you know my opinion on
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
this you know that language was again
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
included in this bill only to match the
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
language you know for a merchant to
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
detain a shoplifter
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't think that that's
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
so and then there's a separate uh
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment here that specifically
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
in a different RSA that will place that
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
Authority for a law enforcement office
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
to make an arrest without a warrant
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
based on your detention I guess my
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
question would be if a healthcare
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
providers in a scenario where they don't
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
have security a smaller hospital or
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or something else
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
do you think it would still be valuable
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
at least a justification for any health
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
care provider to use some physical Force
 
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:24.260 align:start position:0%
to change somebody
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
for those smaller agencies that don't
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
have security right I guess maybe that's
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking this is weird towards
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
I think you know everybody as you know
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
everybody has the right to defend
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
themselves and that you know if that
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
includes having to detain somebody until
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
the threat is over you know they're
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
already protected by that
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you know CMS
 
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.490 align:start position:0%
um you know CMS
um

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
has specific guidelines about
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
detention and releasing a you know
 
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.930 align:start position:0%
detention and releasing a you know
releasing

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
releasing
 
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
releasing
um

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
removing a restraint you know as soon as
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
possible right so you know those are the
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
guidelines with you know that we follow
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
as well so as soon as the threat is over
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
that detention you know can be released
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not certain that there's any
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
clinician who would really
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
be interested in you know detaining
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
somebody of course it's unless for their
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
own protection
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know but in the in the event of a
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
hospital that has contract security
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's a different matter I
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
would think however they're still
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
protected under that other statute
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
um in a situation where you where you
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
have an incident and you've called the
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
police what is the procedure now does a
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
security person
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
detain the person if they're trying to
 
00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:50.299 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to get away
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
how does it work now
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
so you know if they're if they're trying
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
to get away right the the intention of
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
this bill for me right is to
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
provide the victim of the assault
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
which you know a clinician here right
 
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.470 align:start position:0%
which you know a clinician here right
um

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
some type of protection so if there's an
 
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
assault and the patient runs out of the
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
hospital right you know then that threat
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
to us to the clinician is gone right
 
00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:19.070 align:start position:0%
to us to the clinician is gone right
that's

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
from from a security perspective that's
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
okay you know from a clinician or a
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
clinical perspective probably not right
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.950 align:start position:0%
clinical perspective probably not right
so

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so that's a different matter so if we
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
take an assault that happens and we call
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
the police and they come in and you know
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's evidence of an assault they do
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
their investigation and you know this um
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that this
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
crime has been committed well it's a
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offense and you know
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
except for a few limited exceptions
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know they may they're not going to
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
make that arrest so again just for a
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of background
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
um not to bore you guys
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
in in my years of law enforcement I
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
can't ever remember making an arrest
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
based on this um exception you know
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
um you predict future Behavior you know
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
it kind of the municipalities I worked
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
for kind of saw that as a um
 
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:18.419 align:start position:0%
a risk right you know uh and so
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
um although it's on it's on the books
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
um wasn't always used for that reason so
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
you know this is just some clarity to
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
the police that they can arrest in this
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
right now if we call the police and they
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
find that there's evidence of this
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level assault they'll take
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
the information and if the victim wants
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
to proceed with the matter they'll um
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
request a warrant an arrest warrant
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard testimony that you
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
know would be okay just to you know take
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
that approach
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
and it I would say depending on the size
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the community
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the speed with which you can
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
get a warrant differs greatly
 
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
get a warrant differs greatly
um

00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
you know in my experience at Manchester
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
police you know it could take over a
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
week to get a warrant sometimes you know
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
based on this level of offense you know
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you picture you know an officer going
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
in does the report maybe goes on days
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
off comes back you know submits his
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
request to the judge for Warrant has to
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
be sent over to the court reviewed it
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit of time that goes
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
by it's not always the case where you
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
can go to a small smaller Community you
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
know go to a JP and have that warrant
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
signed right right away
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
I have one for follow-up
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
how many felony level offenses have you
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
seen occur for assaults while you're
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
I'd say probably a half dozen
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
they have been arrested without a
 
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.049 align:start position:0%
they have been arrested without a
warrant

00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
they they can be arrested without a
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
warrant so you know again the victim
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
still has the right to decide if they
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
want to pursue so you know the felony
 
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.850 align:start position:0%
want to pursue so you know the felony
level

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know with the serious bottle
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
injury could be you know uh you know
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
they don't know they may have a broken
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
nose at the time right so you know it
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
takes a little while and when they when
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
the medical records are done you know
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
that that moment has passed yeah so
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
there are those
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I've been you know as a police
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
officer I saw some felony level so again
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
that the felony level is
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
is covered where you know we're good
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
with that the majority of the assaults
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with are the
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offenses which still
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
create a lot of anxiety
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:45.620 align:start position:0%
any follow-up
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you no thank you very much I
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
anyone else offer to testimony please
 
00:31:08.169 --> 00:31:08.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
Center thank you so much for your time
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
Our concern is that there is a problem
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
with Workforce safety
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
but this is not the solution that
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
matches that problem and appropriately
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
addresses it
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
and the the reason I say this is that
 
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:36.500 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
we for well
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
I think the situations we're talking
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
about for the most part involve people
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
who experience mental illness who are
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
transported to a hospital on an
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission they are
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
in great psychological distress
 
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.549 align:start position:0%
in great psychological distress
and

00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this committee wants
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
to criminalize that behavior at the same
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
time we don't want our health care
 
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.190 align:start position:0%
time we don't want our health care
Workforce

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
put in danger
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
so I think what you know there was a
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
study committee about this issue and one
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
of the primary recommendations was that
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
in all instances wherever possible that
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques be practiced so
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
these warrantless arrests that we're
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
talking about would occur after the
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers already sustained an
 
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.010 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers already sustained an
injury

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
injury
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
so instead of focusing there if we look
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
to what's what's the root of the problem
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have a very it's a very distressed
 
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.909 align:start position:0%
we have a very it's a very distressed
population

00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
individuals who are experiencing
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
significant mental illness
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know very disoriented maybe you know
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
hearing voices maybe really afraid
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
and their emotions everything is
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
escalated so
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
but and but they need treatment
 
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.830 align:start position:0%
but and but they need treatment
so

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
if they are no longer presenting a
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
danger I don't know why we would want to
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
if you know they've flailed to try to
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
avoid a restraint for example
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
knocked a health care worker why would
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
we want to criminalize that divert them
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
to the court system instead of trying to
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to help them regain
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
some composure and be able to get
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
treatment that healthcare worker already
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
was hit instead I think we need to work
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
on providing the resources that
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers require the training
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to know how to de-escalate
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
when to back off support they might need
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
consulting services or support from
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric or psychological
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
professionals they may need some
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
additional training
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know all manner of things to address
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
the problem here which is that we've got
 
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:55.820 align:start position:0%
a really
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
volatile some volatile people who are
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental illness
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
who you know if if they aren't treated
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
appropriately could end up
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know in some unprivileged physical
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
contact that's what we're talking about
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
here and I and we don't want our
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers subjected to that
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
we don't want our patients to have to be
 
00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
diverted to the criminal justice system
 
00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:24.169 align:start position:0%
diverted to the criminal justice system
unnecessarily

00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
chairman

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the from your perspective would you
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
say that the a better solution to this
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
would be mental health institutions
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
where we could place people who may have
 
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.649 align:start position:0%
where we could place people who may have
uh

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
a need for a care but can't necessarily
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
be in the care of someone who doesn't
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
understand or have the right training to
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
I think there's like multiple things
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
that need to happen
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
in in the ideal world I DRC my
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
organization is not a real proponent of
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
over institutionalization I think part
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
of the issue is that we don't have
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
adequate an adequate array of robust
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
community-based services so that we can
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
discharge people from our psychiatric
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
hospital or from transitional housing
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
into the community so and so that's
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
created this backdoor problem right
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're not getting people out when
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
they're ready to leave the Department of
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has publicly
 
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
stated on multiple occasions that from
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital has that they
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
have about 60 people on any given day
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
who are ready for discharge and not
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that setting but they
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
don't have an appropriate place to
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
discharge them too and we do have some
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
transitional housing but it's become
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a transition to Nowhere right
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the place the step
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
down for the people in transitional
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
housing to make room for the people who
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
are ready to leave the hospital so that
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's one aspect of the problem
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
and you know fundamentally we need to be
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to treat people in the community
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
and provide services before someone gets
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
to a crisis level of need so that's
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
another way to address the issue besides
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
beds and housing and residential
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
supports would be to have a more robust
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services System so those
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
are things that need to happen I
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
understand that you know we don't get to
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
wave a magic wand and make that happen
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow too bad
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime we know that we have
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
this issue that is being worked on in
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
various ways
 
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.450 align:start position:0%
various ways
um

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
so what can we do for the people who we
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
know are going to ultimately or you know
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
for a while anyway
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
be in Psycho psychiatric distress
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
because we know they exist they're going
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
to end up in our hospitals and they're
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be in the right Hospital
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be in distress at
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
the same time understanding that we
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
don't want our health care workers put
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
at risk and and this is you know where I
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
think we need to consider
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
whether a warrantless arrest expanding
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
our warrantless arrest statute is
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
actually going to address that problem I
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't see it addressing that problem I
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
see it removing some important civil
 
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
rights that people have
 
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
um to not have a warrantless arrest
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
except in certain circumstances where
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
there's you know exigency they're you
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
know gonna flee what like our current
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
law says if they're going to be
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
destroying evidence fleeing from the
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
scene which is unlikely at a hospital or
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
as was in the bill as introduced
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
um where it was this concept was
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
slightly expanded where they are
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
actually interfering with the delivery
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
of medically necessary services and
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're disrupting the hospital so that
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill wasn't the language
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
was developed the way it was to
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
recognize that maybe there would be this
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
time when someone despite all efforts is
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to really disrupt the ability
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the facilities to do their job and
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
treat people and that's why the parties
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
that came together including my office
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
reluctantly thought you know that that
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
may make sense as an expansion but to
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
expand our warrantless arrest law for
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors including times when the
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
person is no longer they're not they're
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
not leaving we know who they are they're
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
not stealing the hospital stuff
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
like a merchant situation
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
and and they're no longer interfering
 
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
with the operations of the hospital why
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
would we want to expand our law in such
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
a way to divert those folks to the
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system without a
 
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.270 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system without a
warrant

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
remembering they can be arrested
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's just you know the warrant process
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
would have to be followed
 
00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:51.950 align:start position:0%
would have to be followed
representative

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I have like five questions in my head
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.770 align:start position:0%
for you
so

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to make a little statement
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
first but
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to empty I go into
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals all the time
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
and because of the problems that you
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure our Hospital staff has
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
been trained to deal with the mental
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
health issues right because
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
they're parked in there for days at a
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
time they're dealing with them they've
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
learned how to deal with them they
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
provider of emergency care
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
a mental health person is flailing about
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
and hits me because they have no idea
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
what they're doing I chalk that up to I
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
forgot to duck right and I'm not going
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
to file a charge on them
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
the person I'm gonna file a charge on
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
that I want arrested and removed
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
is the drunk
 
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.930 align:start position:0%
is the drunk
who

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
stood up knelt up on the stretcher
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
cornered the nurse and grabbed her
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
multiple times until somebody came over
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
and stopped him
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
and then when the security came
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
he was ready to go again
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
that guy needs to be removed right that
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
guy needs to be arrested and gone so
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
those are the patients that we're
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
looking at right are the ones that are
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
and of course as soon as the police
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
officer walks in they go
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just sitting here they're making
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
this all up
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen it I've witnessed it
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's where this bill comes into effect
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
because you know as soon as the cop
 
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.490 align:start position:0%
because you know as soon as the cop
leaves

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
he's back on
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
I've seen that too
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
so this is what I see is the problem
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that everybody seems to be missing and
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
focusing on the mental health patient
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
who is not going to be the one that we
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
want arrested because we understand it
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
going through a psychotic issue
 
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.970 align:start position:0%
going through a psychotic issue
so

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think you all are missing the point
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
can I address that I think I hear what
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
you're saying in that situation that you
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
describe where the person is they're
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
drunk they're unruly they're continuing
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be threatening
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
I think that that person
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
could end up if in terms of how the bill
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
was introduced it it said through actual
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
or threatened violence interferes in the
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
provision of medically necessary Health
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
Care Services I think that that
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
situation would be covered it sounds
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
like that person is only you know is
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
like having doing this doing this doing
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
this person police officer walks out of
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
the room doing it doing it doing it you
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
have reason to believe that's what's
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
happening here I think that could get
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
the police officer what they need to do
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
a warrantless arrest without amending
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
this statute and the risk is that
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
the situation you're talking about you
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
sound like a really
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
well-informed well-trained EMT who
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
understands mental health issues and
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know the what you said about being
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
able like knowing when to duck not
 
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.910 align:start position:0%
able like knowing when to duck not
everyone

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
is is this trained or sensitive or maybe
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be interested in pressing
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
charges as you and we're legislating for
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
all situations
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
um if everyone could be like you it
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
might not be as big a problem right but
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
we but we know that that's not the case
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'd rather err on the side of the
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare worker
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying people have to
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
go to work stay there
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
and get their ass beat
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and there's nothing
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
they can do about it that's not good
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
at at this point like let's play this
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
out if this were to happen the
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers already sustained an
 
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.530 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers already sustained an
injury

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
injury
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
and if he stays he's going to get
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
another one
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
well the person could be charged
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
the person if the person presents an
 
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.490 align:start position:0%
the person if the person presents an
ongoing

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
danger then they could be arrested
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
and I I really do think like we we need
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
probably to look at this with a broader
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
brush we have to let this commission and
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why the commission
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
established in SB 459 which passed last
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
year is delayed and getting started with
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
its work
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know I think hopefully that
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
commission will have some
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations the other thing is I I
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't learn until the hearing
 
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
on this that RSA 627 6 Roman 8 already
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
permits authorized
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
um employees at a hospital or any health
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
care facility to use non-deadly Force
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
um when it's needed when they reasonably
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
believe it necessary to maintain the
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
decorum or safety and allows them even
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
to use deadly force
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
um when they think that's necessary to
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
prevent death or serious bodily injury
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
so there's already a statutory provision
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
that would allow a hospital with someone
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
who's presenting A continuing threat
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
like you describe
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
um that is disrupting the decorum and
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
safety of that institution to remove
 
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.710 align:start position:0%
safety of that institution to remove
people

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
so I it's just another reason why
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do necessarily such a
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
broad sweep to cover that unruly drunk
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
person you're talking about that would
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
also take with the people who experience
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Muse
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
and just just a quick follow-up this the
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
statute that you mentioned again could
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
you one one more with the once more with
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
the RSA I can talk really fast RSA 627
 
00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:52.339 align:start position:0%
colon six
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask uh
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
most Hospital settings
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
you don't move into training now we're
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
talking medical doctors we're talking uh
 
00:45:20.819 --> 00:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
talking medical doctors we're talking uh
RNs

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
RNs
 
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:24.980 align:start position:0%
we're also talking uh
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
Advanced practitioners
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
these people all have a good working
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge and understanding of mental
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
health in general to be licensed don't
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
they well
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm outside of my Lane a little bit here
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
I I think they have a license that in
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
their specialty areas of practice I
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what training that they
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
receive in terms of being able to
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
address someone with significant Mental
 
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.170 align:start position:0%
address someone with significant Mental
Health

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
active psychosis and and that may be one
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that the hospitals joined
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
in this in intervening in that lawsuit
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
and federal court
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
um where they argued successfully that
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
the state's failure to get these folks
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
out as soon as they're deemed
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be IE Aid is a you know
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
kind of is a taking for them and I think
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
what they argued is that they are not
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
prepared and adequately staffed and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
compensated to deal with these
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
situations you know I our office isn't
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
part of that lawsuit but I've read the
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
decision and I've read some of the
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
pleadings and that's my understanding
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals are saying that
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
they're not fully equipped to and I you
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
know I would hope that they would be but
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
apparently they feel that they're not
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily fully equipped and
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
and helping people to get the training
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
they need it's maybe not something that
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
can be legislated it may be something
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
that is more important some places than
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
others it may be that some areas of the
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
state have the workforce that has the
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
necessary training and support available
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
to it to be able to address people in
 
00:46:59.569 --> 00:46:59.579 align:start position:0%
such distress but others don't
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
it would be an issue for the commission
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
to take up
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I just wanted
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
to comment
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I was a nurse in a former life and
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
worked primarily in mental health uh
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
mostly pediatric mental health and child
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
protection and um I will say you know my
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
you know I've met lots of rotations in
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
nursing school went to BU and hospitals
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
that I've worked in and in an emergency
 
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
room you've got uh respiratory
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
therapists lab people people from X-ray
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I would be willing to to suggest
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
that most of those people do not have a
 
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.089 align:start position:0%
that most of those people do not have a
background

00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:35.099 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
um in in mental mental health
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's you know I often
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
say you know I would be a great I was a
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
great psych nurse but if you put me on a
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
Cardiology unit I would not be good I
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
mean it would not be good for the
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
patients because that wasn't my area of
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
expertise so we all come to to the
 
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.950 align:start position:0%
expertise so we all come to to the
healthcare

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
facilities with different backgrounds
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
and knowledge and you know one of the
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
other things that I that you know I'm
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
looking over the the um
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
input that we've received from
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I know as a nurse staffing
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
is often an issue in hospitals and you
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
know we we do a lot we cover a lot we we
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
do whatever we can but one of the
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
dangers I see in
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
um making
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
um first of all I think this this is in
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
the wrong statute to begin with I'm
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
confused by that but
 
00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:24.130 align:start position:0%
confused by that but
um

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
when when the expectation is um when
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
when when security staff is short
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and there's a need to deal with a
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
situation the expectation now would
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
become would be placed upon Healthcare
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
Providers to deal specifically
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
um with these things I've been a little
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
concerned that that burden might in an
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
effort to help health providers
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
we might actually be burdening Health
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
Providers and putting them in some
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
situations where they're not adequately
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
prepared to to deal and so I don't know
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
for me I you know I I um
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
with all the work that went into the
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
this um the commission
 
00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
um and the stakeholder input
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know I think that
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
first uh Cindy rosenwald's amendment was
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
the right way to go
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and I I think this Senate amendment
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
that was not vetted by anybody has just
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
sort of snowballed and you know both are
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned but I think the second
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
one has created more problems than than
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
was original so I would just like to see
 
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.030 align:start position:0%
was original so I would just like to see
us

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
look at that first the original
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
SB 85 excuse me 58
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
and you know see what their what is it
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
there that's problematic
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and is there something that we need
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
to change on that but I don't know I
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
just I think this is sort of it's just
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
convoluted and it's become a bigger
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
problem with this this floor Amendment
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know when all of the
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholders had come to agreement
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the beginning you know on the on um
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced I know I'd sort
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
of like we're
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
we're in a you know I I don't know I
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
think it's it's more work that's sort of
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
non-productive because I think it's
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
already been hashed out and people have
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement so I don't know
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
just like just just to clarify you're
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
referring to the one dated March 29th
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and that's one of the things
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we looked at as a committee as well
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
as these are two separate uh really the
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 58 is under two separate
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
statutes one's under the use of four
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
statue and the other one's under the
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
arrest statute the arrest statute to me
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
seems very clear and concise and that
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
still maintains the probable cause
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
standard for a warrantless arrest if we
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
go into the one under the use of force
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
that gets where a lot of people I think
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
lose it and get convoluted with the
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
language if that's just my personal take
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I've heard that from other members
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
of this committee as well I agree with
 
00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:02.099 align:start position:0%
you and that use of force was really
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
intended for situations where you know
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
like a merchant a movie theater operator
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
we're not talking you know who's being
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
ripped off not by someone who's in a
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis and also in a
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
situation where they haven't registered
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have a band on them
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
identifying who they are they're fleeing
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
with their property and there's just not
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
a likelihood that they'll be able to
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
apprehend that person but to be
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
this is just not about everybody who's
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
in a serious mental health crisis this
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with the director of
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
security for Dartmouth who's the former
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
Chief of Lebanon yesterday I spoke with
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
the sheriff of Sullivan County and the
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
local chief of police in Claremont which
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
has Valley Regional hospital and they're
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
all concise that this is an issue that
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
happens in their hospitals quite
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
regularly and they would be very in
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
support of having warrantless arrests
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
for assaults on on medical staff in
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
their facilities that they oversee I
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
think it depends on I mean we heard
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
various situations at the hearing some
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
involving staff on staff assault
 
00:52:06.319 --> 00:52:07.970 align:start position:0%
involving staff on staff assault
which

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't to me that's a
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
management issue not a warrantless
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
arrest issue I mean that's that's a deep
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem when that kind of don't play
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
silence though it's where it is
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
workplace violence but that's where I
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
get to like what's the problem and are
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
we matching is this legislation a
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem what I mean to
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
me like when you can when you sort of
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
dissect what the committee heard
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
that horrific story we heard about the
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
surgeon who threw a blood-covered
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
instrument in the direction of a nurse
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
and when she went to complain about it
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
was told kind of like along what you
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
said representative Peru good thing you
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
ducked to me that is a huge management
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
problem that that management didn't have
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
her back how do we legislate that how do
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
we how do we manage those employee
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
unemployee situations that should never
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
occur I'm not sure this is that right we
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
talked I think there was testimony about
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
situations with visitors who got
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
disruptive in the hallway and were you
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
know yelling at each other I don't know
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
if there was an assault I don't remember
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
everything exactly in that situation I
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
think that's where RSA 627 6 8 comes
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
into play which would authorize the
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
hospital to
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
forcibly remove that person who's doing
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
that so I think we have that situation
 
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.490 align:start position:0%
that so I think we have that situation
covered

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
this is also maybe why the study
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
committee needs to do its work so that
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
we can really get a we they can get a
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
full understanding of what all the
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
permutations are to this issue what are
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
all the what are all the factors that
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
are impeding Workforce safety for our
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Workforce and what's the most
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to address those
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
or nobody wants to talk now everyone's
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
stuck I know
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
just please identify yourself
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
for the record Holly Stevens and the
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for Nami New
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I did testify at the hearing
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
and you know I just wanted to say that
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
everybody behind you was in agreement it
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
is still an agreement that
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 58 as an introduced is a
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
good solution to this um existing
 
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:29.300 align:start position:0%
problem and I think it would address
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative prue's concerns because
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
it does allow for a warrantless arrest
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody's interfering with with
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
medical procedures so I think it does
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of people who are
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and you know getting in the
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
face of staff and not cooperating
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
because that is interfering with medical
 
00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:51.380 align:start position:0%
problems excuse me the medical treatment
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
and you know Nami New Hampshire has
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
heard that people who are there on ieas
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
are being arrested or being brought to
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
jail so we do know that that is
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
happening in addition to all the other
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
situations that we've heard about but it
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
does happen
 
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.710 align:start position:0%
does happen
um

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that I just wanted
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
to bring up I spoke with our executive
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
director Susan Stearns at length about
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
this bill and if the committee is
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
looking at going with the broader
 
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.730 align:start position:0%
looking at going with the broader
detainment

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
detainment
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
language we would ask that there be a
 
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.170 align:start position:0%
language we would ask that there be a
provision

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
um an amendment made that the hospitals
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
would have to keep track of everybody
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
who was arrested what their presenting
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
problem was whether they were on an iea
 
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:41.540 align:start position:0%
or not and that that information would
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
be provided publicly so that we would
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a sense of what was going on with
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
that the Senate Bill 58 language as
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
introduced were not as concerned about
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't you know be looking at
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
any kind of reporting requirements but
 
00:55:59.930 --> 00:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
if it's the broader language we would
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee consider
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing us to speak
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
um so a couple things were stated
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
um by Ms Rosenberger that I wanted to
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
clarify so the workplace violence
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
prevention program I think my testimony
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
indicated this but I know you guys have
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills so Senate Bill 459 was
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
passed last year signed into law by the
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
governor he had a signing ceremony
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's how important it was at frisbee
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
Memorial Hospital at Senator Gray's
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
hospital because of the importance of
 
00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.589 align:start position:0%
hospital because of the importance of
this

00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
um that is in 15153 workplace violence
 
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
prevention program it outlines very
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
clearly what the hospital's required and
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Urgent Care centers are
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
responsible for and they are responsible
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
for doing
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
um training de-escalation
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera so I just want that
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
off to kind of just clarify that they
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
already do this anyway but now it's
 
00:57:29.049 --> 00:57:29.059 align:start position:0%
documented in in the statute the
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
commission is a separate statute and
 
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:35.180 align:start position:0%
that is under
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
151j the New Hampshire Health Care
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
workplace safety commission again there
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
are two there are four sections of 459
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
three past one did not and that's why
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about 58. so the
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
workplace safety commission is not a
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
study committee as was indicated this is
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
a long this is a permanent if you will
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
not permanent nothing's permanent but
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
this is a commission that will be
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing and not legislators involved
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
there are every single hospital has a
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
seat on it and every single Urgent Care
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
Center has the opportunity to have a
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
seat on it as well as the department of
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
HHS labor has a seat on it the Attorney
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
General's office has a seat on it New
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital has a seat on it
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
because they are not licensed the way
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
the other hospitals are
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and I and three members at large and
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
for instance we would like to have like
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
a nurse from The Nurses Association
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
appointed um for instance um to that
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
works in a hospital or or just um we
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we have requested the
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
commission all of this was delayed for a
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
very valid reason and this was all
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
negotiated last year in the house
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
finance when it was in house finance
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's moved to July of 23 for a good
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
reason um the department of HHS which is
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
where this Falls needs an appropriation
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
needs a staff because they the
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner would be responsible for
 
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to get the um the terminology
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
correct on the form that will be needed
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
to for every single Facility by law that
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
would have to fill out every single
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
assault you have to fill out a universal
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
form and because one of the reasons that
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
came out of the study committee was we
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
don't have consistent accurate data and
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
we want that for the commission which
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
will be protected by privacy just like
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
the quality commission is which is also
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
a permanent Commission
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
um they would be protected and have a
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
discussion about best practices
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
um what what the situations were ex and
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
then maybe come come back to the
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and ask for further changes
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
or just develop
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
um protocols working with law
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement working with um with the
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
Department with whoever um is
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate with the Attorney General's
 
01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:01.549 align:start position:0%
appropriate with the Attorney General's
office

01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and the department so that is those
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
are very important components that are
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
already in law
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
um there so I just wanted to clarify
 
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.630 align:start position:0%
um there so I just wanted to clarify
that

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
um so and then
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
I guess it was stated
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
um by um Ms Stevens and I appreciate
 
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
um by um Ms Stevens and I appreciate
that

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 58 was negotiated by all
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I'm not quite sure where
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
the DRC stands now I I heard a lot um
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
from her and I'm not I I thought that
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
they were fine with Senate Bill 58 as
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
um introduced but um that was my
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and they did not testify
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
during the Senate phase the difference
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
again is what has changed because of the
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment but Senate Bill 58 and
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
we and I agree with representative
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy we call it the Rosenwald
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment the amendment that was
 
01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:55.220 align:start position:0%
introduced and did not pass on the floor
 
01:00:59.289 --> 01:00:59.299 align:start position:0%
makes a minor change to the way 58 was
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
introduced to clarify because one of the
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
concerns was we didn't want and I've
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
talked with some of you about this we
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't want law enforcement having to
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
make the determination of medical
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
necessity that is not that was never our
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
intent so to move the medical the
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
determination to be medically necessary
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
to the end of the sentence that's where
 
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:23.540 align:start position:0%
that's the Rosenwald Amendment which is
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
1251s which I know is in your docket um
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
so we I mean we we agree we we did have
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the problem is it did not pass the
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
Senate um but
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
if you believe this is the more
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate approach I continue to work
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
with I keep I keep Senator I talked to
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
Senator gray last night about this he's
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
very everyone's very interested in this
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
um as you know it it made the union
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
leader yesterday so
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
um I've talked I talked to Senator
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
Whitley last night I talked to another
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
Senator um they all care about this bill
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
um we will work whatever you pass if it
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
passes the house we will work to get and
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
I know you will help me
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
um get this through the Senate if it's
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
if it means 58 the Rosenwald Amendment
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
if that makes more more sense which
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
again you have stakeholders behind you
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
saying that that would work I think you
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
guys are the professionals you you've
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
been in this in this field um if you
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe this would work law enforcement
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh believes this would work they can't
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill because they don't
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
have Universal agreement but um I think
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
you will you've talked to um some law
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement they believe that this could
 
01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:37.849 align:start position:0%
enforcement they believe that this could
work

01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:38.630 align:start position:0%
work
um

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to help clarify a couple
 
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.049 align:start position:0%
just wanted to help clarify a couple
things

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.370 align:start position:0%
things
representative

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
question sure uh my question is about
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
the health care provider or his agent uh
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
are we looking at the bill as amended
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes we don't have a copy of the original
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill we only have the amended
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
version of it so when you when people
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
are speaking okay we don't have that
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
copy so uh
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
that part there doesn't specific it
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
talks about agents which would come a
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
security office right because exactly
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
one thing that's on my mind is are there
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
scenarios in your experience or a
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
testimony that you've heard that there
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
are health care providers that do not
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
have security
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
um good question
 
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
um Mr Patty referenced some Hospital
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
small hospitals contract security
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're not as large as CMC so they
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
don't have Personnel on staff so they
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
contract with them unfortunately I don't
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
know that they I'd have to survey the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals but I don't believe that
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
they're um there 24 7.
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
they have security
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I just worry that they don't have
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
full-time security
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
oh hello all right so I guess my
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
question is uh let's say it's a
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
one of those smaller providers doctor's
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
office because this says healthcare
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
provider that would cover it yeah I
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that too I think
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
certain care things like that it's only
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
and not doctor's offices this does not
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
this statute um does not would not
 
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.770 align:start position:0%
this statute um does not would not
um

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
well so specifically well the RSA
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
151.2 would I guess identify which ones
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
would be covered right that also cover
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
urgent care facilities uh 151 to yes I
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
believe it does
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
um but not doctors offices they're not
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
licensed under Health Facilities doctors
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
are licensed under as their clinicians
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
but their offices are not so offices
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
would not be um or um this would just be
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have to pull up the statute and I
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
should know it by heart but um it does
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
include urgent care in hospitals and ASC
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers what I'm
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
trying to get out here is
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
what protection do we provide to Health
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities covered under that
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
statute that don't have security where
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
they may have
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh healthcare providers that use
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
physical Force to detain somebody and
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
then no longer
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
protected under this statute if we
 
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
remove that part of the bill
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
so I'm what I'm asking you should we
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
still include that justification for
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
Force for health care providers nurses
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
doctors orderlies I don't even know if
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's a term that we use anymore and
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
not just security guards
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think I need John up here okay
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
and I know I asked John earlier I just
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
didn't know if um
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
we should also keep that part of the
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
language for that reason
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
what is here
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
I think he's talking about the use of
 
01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:42.549 align:start position:0%
I think he's talking about the use of
force

01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's under 627 627 thank you let me
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
so earlier I asked you about
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and you didn't see a need for that to
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
be in there if you're already Justified
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
law that passed a few years ago but my
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
concern is as if there are no security
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
on staff a smaller place
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
should we still allow justification to
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
protect health care providers that may
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
use physical Force to defend themselves
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
or to detain somebody
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
so yes in my opinion yes oh thank you
 
01:06:27.059 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
so yes in my opinion yes oh thank you
um

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
two different matters right so
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
RSA under 627 6 Roman numeral eight is
 
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.809 align:start position:0%
RSA under 627 6 Roman numeral eight is
not

01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
is not just for
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
assaults that occur right sometimes
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
security has to escort patients you know
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
back to areas right and you know we
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
didn't have any protection you know
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know statutorily to be you know
 
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
physically grabbing people and and you
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
know bringing them back to to a room so
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was that intention of that
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but to your point yes you know as I
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
said before everybody has the right to
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
protect themselves you know and this
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
just clarifies it for me so yes uh short
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
answer I would say yes thank you
 
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.950 align:start position:0%
answer I would say yes thank you
good

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
um so you support SB 58 the Rosenwald
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment or as amended by the Senate
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald is what we agreed to last year
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
as part of you know SB 459 just clarify
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's the one dated to the 29th of
 
01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.529 align:start position:0%
that's the one dated to the 29th of
March

01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
so yes yes
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay I have a copy if anyone needs
 
01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:39.299 align:start position:0%
I do if actually can I get a connection
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
um can I get a follow-up ask also
 
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.589 align:start position:0%
um can I get a follow-up ask also
um

01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
can I can I just augment a little bit
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
sure we we are not opposed to 58 as
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
amended um by the Senate we could live
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
with it um but we are not it is not what
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
we all agreed to so
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
um if it again it is so important that
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
our health care workers be protected we
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
need something to pass I know that is
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
not a universal um position
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and you have heard testimony
 
01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
um and you have heard testimony
um

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
not supporting the amended bill
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
we think 58 as the with the Rosenwald
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify that works better
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
um but it did not pass the Senate so
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
that was our concern
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but this is a new body um this is a
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
new opportunity to to get it right and
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
then whatever changes then we would work
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
to get it through
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um to the Senate but we all worked very
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
hard on Senate Bill 58 as introduced
 
01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:45.299 align:start position:0%
and a question for you I I've been
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
hearing a couple of different things I
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
think the representative from the DRC
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned I know representative Muse
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
wrote down the the RSA number I didn't
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
um it started with six but it's allowed
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
from her's testimony it allowed you to
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
use uh physical force or even deadly
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
force if necessary to restrain a patient
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
and that by her testimony was already in
 
01:09:06.839 --> 01:09:07.970 align:start position:0%
and that by her testimony was already in
statute

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a little bit confused by it
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
don't I mean I'm seeing that you already
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
have that power base done the testimony
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
from the DRC sure so
 
01:09:16.679 --> 01:09:17.209 align:start position:0%
from the DRC sure so
um

01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
different scenarios right so yes we have
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
the right to detain somebody but we
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to arrest right
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the police
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
to come in when I call the police I want
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
them to be able to come in and make that
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
determination and be able to arrest that
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
patient without without applying for a
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
warrant under a misdemeanor level
 
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.590 align:start position:0%
warrant under a misdemeanor level
offense

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
two different matters so if someone was
 
01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.990 align:start position:0%
two different matters so if someone was
detained

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
detained
 
01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
and the police came you're saying that
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
they would let that person go or not get
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
a warrant to arrest them if that person
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
was detained for for using physical
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
violence against the health care worker
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
they may they have that discretion they
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't you know this isn't a mandatory
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
arrest we're not asking for that so the
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
police have the discretion to make that
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
determination at that point whether or
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
not they're going to arrest that person
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of time if I could just continue a
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
lot of times they don't make a decision
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
to arrest because
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
you know part of one of the limited
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
exceptions under the under 594 10 says
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the person will you know continue
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
that behavior or act out again right and
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
as I testified to before I don't
 
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
I don't understand putting a victim
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
in a position where they have to be
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
assaulted again
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
to um give the police the justification
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
no further questions
 
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.330 align:start position:0%
no further questions
representative

01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
do we know why the Senate didn't like
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
the Rosenwald and they decided to go
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
with this was there something in this
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
that they said oh we don't like that and
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
we need this instead
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
um so I'm kind of trying to figure that
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
out so we could maybe speak to some of
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
it sure maybe smooth that over for them
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
and give them a version of this that is
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
tolerable yep
 
01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
tolerable yep
um

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
some of this happened behind the scenes
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
without our knowledge so um we know that
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
there were concerns
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
um it went to Senate Judiciary we know
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
that there were some concerns relative
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
to again the determination of a service
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
being medically necessary we worked on
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
that language again with stakeholders it
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
was important that it be in there to
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
ensure that we were talking about
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
services that were being medically that
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
were being provided that are medically
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
kind of to limit yeah we wanted to be
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
very limiting as far as the application
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
of this and I think one example could be
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
if you are have been IE8 and you are
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
waiting for a transfer to a drf or New
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital you may not actually
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
be getting medically necessary Services
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
um because you have already been
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
determined that you need to be
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
transferred and you just wait you're
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you're boarding in the
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
hospital that's why we believed that it
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
was very important to include that some
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
Senators had a little bit of
 
01:12:17.159 --> 01:12:17.830 align:start position:0%
Senators had a little bit of
um

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
heartburn with that that's why we moved
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
the language to the end of the sentence
 
01:12:23.159 --> 01:12:24.290 align:start position:0%
the language to the end of the sentence
because

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
um 58th
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
hold on as introduced
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
no as introduced I'm sorry hold on I
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.250 align:start position:0%
have it
um

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
I have a very big file uh let's see
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
um the as introduced
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
um was while in the care of a medical
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
professional on the premises of a
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
residential care or Health Care Facility
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
as defined in 151.2
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
through actual or threatened violence
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
interfere with the provision of
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
medically necessary services so what we
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
did the Rosenwald Amendment just um
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
takes interferes with the provision of
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
health care services and then we moved
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
it to that a licensed Medical
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
Professional has determined to be
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
medically necessary some of the
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
arguments by some of the Senators was it
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
would be law enforcement's determination
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
that it was medically necessary and
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
we're like no that's not what that means
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
um because it would be in the medical
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
record if it went they were kind of
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
jumping to if it goes to if they press
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
charges and go to court we were just
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
talking about actually as John has um
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
stated just getting getting law
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement to act um and without a
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
warrant so that was that's the piece
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to focus on so we
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
thought well we'll make it really clear
 
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:43.970 align:start position:0%
thought well we'll make it really clear
um

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
we were there and then but we it still
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't not everyone was comfortable
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and then this floor amendment was um
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we did the the vote in the Senate was
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
delayed a number of times to try to get
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
to a place that um folks could be
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and that's where the
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment came in and again not
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
everyone saw it and not everyone is
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately comfortable with it
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
um it was a creative approach
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
um it just we're not sure that it it
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
hits the Mark
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the way that we were that we thought
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
58 would but it did the Rosenwald
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment failed by one vote or two
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
votes um I should say two because it
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
would have been even
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and um Senator Gannon was missing at
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
the time so it was um it was an 11 to 12
 
01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.330 align:start position:0%
the time so it was um it was an 11 to 12
vote

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so a 12-12 would have failed of
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
course but um it failed by two boats so
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's not insurmountable I guess it's my
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
like a huge we're all against this no no
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
no not at all not at all
 
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.390 align:start position:0%
no not at all not at all
foreign

01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
just just did want to say
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
um just reading the uh the Senate report
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the original public hearing it it
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
looked like one of the Senators had a
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
question around whether or not
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the original bill would apply to
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
places like cafeterias and I thought
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
that by I thought that perhaps it needed
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit broader which may
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
explain the floor Amendment which is
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
much broader
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
um uh and and I think the where we have
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
the difference of opinion is whether or
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
not the bill should really be structured
 
01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.850 align:start position:0%
not the bill should really be structured
around

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
around
um

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
situations where Medical Services aren't
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
being provided because of disruption
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
um or if
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
or if something is needed that basically
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
would apply everywhere in the entire
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
facility which it seems like New
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law already would cover it
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
would and I'll let John touch upon that
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
but that would be considered trespassing
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
if you're in the in the cafeteria and
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're just start throwing things
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
because you're frustrated because your
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
loved one is in the hospital and and for
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
whatever that you're a guest in that
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
private facility you could be escorted
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
out um so we don't and and it was
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
intentional to be very limiting
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
um as has been stated
 
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.430 align:start position:0%
um as has been stated
um so

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want it to apply across the
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
across the institution
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree she she hit on it
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's New Hampshire statutes are
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
really most of them are crafted very
 
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.649 align:start position:0%
really most of them are crafted very
well

01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and you know we have not we I'm not
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
police anymore police have the power to
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
remove that type of person from a
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
cafeteria if you will I don't need to go
 
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
into all the details but yes she's right
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for anyone
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
oh goodness
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's not really a question but I want to
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
have your input as a as I talk about
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
this so there's three separate things
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
going on here I know it was confusion
 
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
about why it was in physical Force
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
um and we talked about the amendment of
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
the law from the last couple years ago
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
that gave you guys permission to use
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
deadly force or non-deadly Force
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the three things going on here are
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
detaining somebody
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
using physical force and then a
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
so I think the
 
01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:24.659 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald Amendment doesn't talk about
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
detaining somebody or giving anyone the
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
authority to detain
 
01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.070 align:start position:0%
authority to detain
the

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:34.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment SB 58 as amended talks about
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
detainment and use of physical Force
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
also covers warrantless arrests but
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
probably not as as good as a rules and
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
wall Amendment does I don't have the
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
original copy as I said so
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
depending on which one we go with some
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
of them are missing some elements
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
some of them don't allow for detainment
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
by Hospital personnel
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of them don't allow for
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
justification of physical Force by
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hospital Personnel
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I actually I think this
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment only covers warrantless
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
arrests by officers so we're missing two
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
other elements there that I think may be
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
important still
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
so great point Thank you so ultimately I
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
think Paula already alluded to this it
 
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.850 align:start position:0%
think Paula already alluded to this it
was

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
the amended the floor amendment was a
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
creative approach because there were
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
some concerns with the language in the
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
original sb58
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the detaining portion and the
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
physical Force portion you know elements
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
of that they're not needed in this
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
statute there there's
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
other statutory protections out there
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know no matter where we
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
want to hide this it is about a
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest that's all this comes
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
down to is giving and it's not even
 
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
it's not even additional
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
a warrantless arrest Powers it's just
 
01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
clarifying A circumstance in which the
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
police can do it so that was the
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
intention of the limited scope of the
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
original language right we didn't want
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
too broad you know to to concern others
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
um so you're right you're you're spot on
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you can keep it I
 
01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be really brief this is
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg again policy director
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center I want to clear
 
01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
up ambiguity because apparently I did
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
was not clear the language and the
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald amendment is acceptable to the
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center we it's very
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
close to what we had um all worked on
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
together and the bill is introduced and
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
we were consulted prior to the moving of
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
the languages Ms minnehan described to
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
you so just so that you all know we are
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
fine with that language and
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
um I thank my colleague Ms minnehan for
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
pointing out the difference between what
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
passed and what didn't pass and what's
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
in effect and not in effect right now
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
and moving forward I do want to point
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
out that the commission that was created
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's now in 151 J2 that hasn't been
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
able to start its work yet will be also
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
looking at supporting the development
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
and implementation of Healthcare
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
workflow Place violence prevention
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
programs including training so that is
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
in there so I know that hospitals are
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
working to do this but there's also more
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
work to be done so I wanted to clarify
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
really all I wanted to say thank you for
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
the clarification thank you
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything they want to
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
I take it no one here is from motion
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
I want to recognize representative Muse
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I am uh
 
01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.709 align:start position:0%

01:41:27.719 --> 01:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
um
proposing

01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
that I won yeah
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
so representative Muse could we get a
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
um explain I'm sorry yeah trying to get
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself here that's okay
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead and explain
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does I I think we you
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
know we want to say uh we heard you
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
um there were some definite concerns
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
with the bill the way that it came back
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh amended from the Senate and one of
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
the things that we realize is that
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh our process uh both in the
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate doesn't necessarily
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
always allow for the the degree of of
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
public input on uh on some of the things
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
that we do that we would like to speak
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to floor
 
01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.729 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to floor
amendments

01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
so in effect today we had a we had a
 
01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing the public hearing that
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
we we didn't have uh on on the bill as
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
it came through from the Senate
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
so I I want to thank everybody who came
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
out today uh I think this has helped us
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
get to a better place
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
um in anticipating uh based on the
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
public hearing where this might go I had
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
prepared an amendment in advance and and
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like this is where we've wound
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
up what what the amendment uh
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
effectively does is take us back to the
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
um as it was submitted uh and
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
incorporates the Rosenwald Amendment
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I we we uh believe that uh this
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
will address the concerns of the the
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
medical community uh it will provide
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
police with the power to make a
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest uh in these
 
01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.209 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest uh in these
situations

01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
um uh hopefully our medical personnel
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
across the state will feel uh a bit
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
safer in these situations I think we
 
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
realize that there's a lot of other
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that needs to be done in terms of
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
housing mental health people people with
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
mental health issues in emergency rooms
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
and and there were I think
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
increasing the safety of our hospitals
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing work in progress but I
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
think this bill could be an important
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
part of the picture
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'm happy to introduce this and
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and I hope we can make a
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee to
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
pass the bill with this amendment
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pru would you
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
we were kind of along the same lines and
 
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.410 align:start position:0%
we were kind of along the same lines and
uh

01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
presented to beat us to the punch and uh
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm glad he did because I didn't have to
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
go get the amendment so pretty happy
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
about that but this is and like you said
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
we heard what you were saying and we
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
kind of agree that
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
this is much cleaner much neater and
 
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
exactly what you guys all agreed to so
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
give me a second a second
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
she was robbed in the second no
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that this is
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely the appropriate solution I
 
01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
think it's been here sort of all along
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I thank representative Muse for
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
um going ahead and getting this
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
amendment made I stakeholders are in
 
01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:33.179 align:start position:0%
agreement I think those of us who have a
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
sense of how hospitals work and
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we want we want to do
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
something for health providers because
 
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:41.699 align:start position:0%
we know it's a it's an issue but we also
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
want law enforcement to be able to use
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
discretion and to take action when they
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
need to and and I think this certainly
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
allows that to happen and I'm sure down
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
the road there will be gaps or holes
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
that will need to be addressed but those
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
things can can happen but at least
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
immediate and and I'm happy to support
 
01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.850 align:start position:0%
immediate and and I'm happy to support
this

01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Willow well I just want
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
to add on to what's the great things
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
that have been said and totally agree
 
01:46:12.169 --> 01:46:12.179 align:start position:0%
I'm thank everyone for coming out today
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh this is clearly an important thing
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
that my grandmother is a nurse and I
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
know very clearly that there are
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
situations happening in the hospitals
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed and I'm happy
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
to come together on a bipartisan
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to address those
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I did just want to weigh those
 
01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
concerns very carefully with the what
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
was brought up by the DRC and Nami which
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
are completely valid concerns of not
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to criminalize mental health
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
further than we already have in our
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
society and I think hopefully this opens
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
up a conversation about uh not waving
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
our magic wand but starting to slow and
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
arduous process that is the sausage
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
making to get robust community-based
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
services so we can hopefully avoid in a
 
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
preventative way this problem without
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
further criminalizing people but I'm
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
happy to move forward in support of this
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
amendment because I know as uh grandson
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
of a stakeholder how important this is
 
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:04.850 align:start position:0%
of a stakeholder how important this is
for

01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
our nurses and our health care workers
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
in our hospitals so I'm very happy to
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
move forward with this so I'm glad we've
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
made that distinction I'm no
 
01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:15.739 align:start position:0%
representative proves about it what's up
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
I like to say that we recognize the
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
importance of this issue and the
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support hopefully will
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
continue in our full committee and then
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
on the house floor I think this is uh
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
probably overdue and
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's time that the criminal justice
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
committee hopefully will start taking a
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
more proactive response to some of these
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
issues been coming before us I know
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've had some people been very upset
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
about the retention of all our bail and
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
judicial bills that we've been holding
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
but this one I'm very comfortable should
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
move smoothly through our full committee
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
at this point and I'd like to thank you
 
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.300 align:start position:0%

01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
