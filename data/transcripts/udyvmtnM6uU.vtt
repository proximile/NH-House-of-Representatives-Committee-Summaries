00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.589 align:start position:0%
Melissa has done as you probably already
know

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
um the sale has on the lonia property
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
has fallen through and we did hear this
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
bill back
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
on the 17th of April it came out of the
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
Senate on a Voice vote there were two
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
people that testified in favor of the
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
bill at our public hearing but that's
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah I I really don't understand
 
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
the bill if there's going to be a
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
development of the uh the
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
area that's that's the bill we're
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
right why isn't the developer paying the
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
$3 million why is the state
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
paying it's a good question U and again
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
I don't see anybody here to can answer
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
that question representative grassy any
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
comment it's being charged against the
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
sale proceeds from the sale of the
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
property so I'm assuming is when the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
property does sell either we will get
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
our money back or we'll pay those bills
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
out of that money and this also goes
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
until um the Appropriations made for the
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
bium ending June
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
2025 so you know what we're looking at
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
here is we've got plenty of time to sell
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
the property and I suppose if the
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
property doesn't sell in the meantime we
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
would end up pay pay that material but
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
then we would get it back when the
 
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.310 align:start position:0%
then we would get it back when the
property

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
sold and if I'm not correct on that
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
please let me know no based on the
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I believe you're correct it
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
shows Melissa this was updated on the
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
20th of December is anything new as far
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
as a fiscal note uh Noe that is correct
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
I did want to point out one thing that I
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
didn't actually include in the email but
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
that did occur in Senate finance and um
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor Senator Lang did speak to
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
and that this $3 million essentially was
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the project for the sale of this
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
property because it was supposed to be
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
turned into affordable housing units um
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where this bill stands
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
if that sale fell through would you
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
still need the 3 million for
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure because you don't know
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
what the sale would be next whoever
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
would buy it next are they still
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
planning on doing affordable housing or
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
would it be something different so I did
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
just want to point that out that
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
occurred in Senate Finance since no
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
one's here to
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify thanks Melissa we pres Griffin
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'd like to
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
comment on representative grassley's
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
comment and say that the $3 million
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
comes out of the state we sell the we
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
sell the property for 20 million and we
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
get 17 we're out 3 million that we don't
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
out my my opinion is that property's
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to be developed if it's a
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
premature development and the
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure should coming to the
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
property needs to be upgraded that
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
should fall on the developer not the
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
state represent Maguire uh thank you Mr
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
chairman so the other disturbing thing
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
we heard about this whole issue is we
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
spent 13 million spent of this money
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
already to buy a granite place right so
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know where we're getting that
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
money and then and and I don't know if
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
should we maybe so to me this is sort of
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
an obvious itl because we're not ready I
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
mean this this the Project's gone the
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
sale is gone and stuff but I is there
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
any possibility that we should hold this
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
bill to do something with to to solve
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
the granite Place problem do Melissa do
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on with that
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
if I don't know I do know in hb2 that
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
obviously the 13 million for granite at
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Place one was contingent on the sale of
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
this currently they are leasing it so I
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
don't know if just the lease would
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
continue until they have the funds to
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
purchase it but I don't have an update
 
00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.509 align:start position:0%
purchase it but I don't have an update
on

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
that any further comment representative
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
Griffin I certainly agree with
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
your uh description because it's 3
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
million that the state wouldn't in fact
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
be out of if we reimburse the city of
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
lonia repres M all right I'll move

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
all right we'll get started with Senate
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 393 relative to making
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the Department of
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to fund Regional
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.149 align:start position:0%
drinking water
infrastructure

00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh Senate President Morris would you
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this bill I would be
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
happy to uh hear from
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
you no that's all right we don't mind
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr chairman um thank you um I just
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
want to eliminate some confusion that
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
happened in the full finance committee
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
in the house um I believe representative
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
Sweeney will be presenting an amendment
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
that actually speaks to what should have
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
come to the house finance committee but
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
um I just don't want anyone to think
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we're only working on one project
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the uh we work throughout the state
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
on water projects but in this Southern
 
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
on water projects but in this Southern
Tier

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
Tier
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
um London der's done approved the towns
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
um worked out whatever funds they had to
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
do um that's the top one that I
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
presented to you again we want to
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
basically as a state um provide the
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
water line and then have the communities
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
pick it up and Branch out um into the
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
hookups and the other one that we've
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
been working on is Hudson um the state
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
funded part of this uh last year I
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
believe um but it's a $34 million
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
project the state put in 9.7 million in
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
that project um the 25 million's coming
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
locally and we explain all that at the
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of all of this the third project
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
is is phase two of a regional project um
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate when the original project was
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
presented which quite honestly hit the
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
house finance committee a $25 million
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
doll project at the Senate asked us to
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
take a look at phasing it in um we
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
worked with the department and if you
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
want pump details or waterline details
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
everybody behind me can answer all of
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
that but 2A is basically the engineering
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
so that they can go find the money for
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
next spring for
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
construction and the um 2A I believe
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has an amendment
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
for today that he can speak to and work
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
with you um we we are doing all kinds of
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
things along the way but let me explain
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
um something that I think is very
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
important from the state's point of view
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
as to how these things are financed I
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
mean we're very good at going after the
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
federal money we're very good at going
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee that we created in 20
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
2016 and getting money um the other part
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
of this is when we built this Regional
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
water line um there was a lot of give
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
from the local communities you can
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
imagine in Manchester Derry Salem their
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
Investments far exceed anything the
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
state's talking about anything the
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars they have into their
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
systems when we connected to them was
 
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.070 align:start position:0%
systems when we connected to them was
basically

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of lawyers and a lot of Selectmen
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
and counselors coming to meetings and
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
making an agreement which is all legally
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
documented and the commissioner is here
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about that but it
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
involved a lot of PE people playing
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
nice and as we move along with this um
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
we know there's an issue we have to deal
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
with financing on to build the big
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
project we just don't want to get into
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
next year and not have it engineered so
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're here today to talk about a and I
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
think we can get to a resolution here
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
because we are working on a couple of
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
other things um it will it require a few
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
bucks in general funds that's up to this
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee um we've explored a few other
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
things to figure out how to pay for the
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
big project we're not ready to go there
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
right now um we certainly worked with VA
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
um to do some of those things um it's
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
just not quite ready to present so um 2B
 
00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:07.389 align:start position:0%
just not quite ready to present so um 2B
and

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
2C down the road let me explain the
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
benefits though of a project like this
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
because we're all trying to sell housing
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
projects throughout the state and not
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
have the government paying for them all
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at 2C 2 C is the connection
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
to Chester New Hampshire which will
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
create density
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
and they can expand that project that
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're doing and over 55 in that
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
Community which I don't think we've ever
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
talked about Chester New Hampshire in
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
any of our committees for housing but
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's a project that's there and if we
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
can bring the water instead of having to
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
drill Wells um to that project which is
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
just outside of Derry um it will change
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
how things are done then I believe we're
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
going to connect to Sandown and maybe
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
go even further east but it's us
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
bringing the source and the developers
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
hooking up to it and that's what we're
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do with all of this I'll take
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
any questions you have on it but I just
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to show some insight on how much
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
is going on in the department um to make
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
all these projects work um they're
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
attending meetings nightly in our
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
communities to make sure we keep going
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
with these
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
projects represent mire has a question
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um am I right that
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire drinking water and
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund the way it works
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
is that it makes loans to local projects
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
and then gets paid back by those
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
projects they do both so there was about
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
280 million when we started in 16 I
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
think there's 9089 million 90 million
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
available right now in there um part of
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's in loans part of it it's in Grants
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the state's position when we built
 
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.230 align:start position:0%
um the state's position when we built
that

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
committee we had $280 million with $800
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
million worth of problems so we were
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
basically going to be a third of it
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
whatever we were talking when we were
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
talking to people so as representative
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
Sweeney which I tried to teach him what
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
our thoughts were there's 6 and a half
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
million here you have to figure out how
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
to pay for 2 million 2 million and two
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
million and the communities while you're
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
doing this are applying for Grants and
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
doing what they have to do so um I think
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
what on this upfront project we are
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
working on a grant that's probably going
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
to happen that so the communities can
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring their third but all the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
communities are tied together on that
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
application um on this Regional one so
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's a big deal thank you follow
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so you mentioned
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
Chester but looking at the three Maps
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
here 2 2A and two I'm sorry 2 A2 B to C
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see any lines getting into
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
Chester at
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
all yeah if you look at um East Dairy
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
2C can you see that one yes solid blue
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
line where the second um square is there
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see on one of these documents the
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
the developer is willing to put up the
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
money to bring the line to his project
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
so if we can get it to there um the
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
developer will hook up to the project I
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
see thank
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
you further questions of yes I just had
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
a really basic question when when you
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
say we who is we or are are you
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
representing a group or the commission I
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
got dragged into the state side of it
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the um about a year ago when I I had
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
left the state house if you hadn't
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
noticed um You probably noticed in your
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
budget because um I'm not I'm not sure
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
how you got to 18 or 19% but um in any
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
case the uh um the commissioner asked me
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
to help and um get back into putting
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
these projects together um so it was
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
extremely important when you appropriate
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
the 9 million for Hudson to work with
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
them and get that going because that has
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
ties to Windom the backup supply for L
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
andary um and to get into pelum which
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
had mtbe contamination which is kind of
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
phasing out um but then you have the
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
London one which is probably the most
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
contaminated um when it comes to pfoas
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
they they have about half the units in
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
the state are in londondary so we were
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
trying to get a source into londondary
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
hey it was a big deal we have testified
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
locally um and we just keep pushing it
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
along I mean in 2016 I was surprised as
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
you are the governor was speaking in the
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
house and at the rostom and told me I
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
was in charge of this so um I've been
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
working on it since
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
2016 but it's everywhere in the state so
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
if you need other information on what's
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
going on in all parts of the state
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
Peterboro Jaffrey the chair knows we did
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
a major project to mpor over there um it
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
was a project that brought 500 jobs to a
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
company so um and it's the way we trying
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
to think a little unique right the
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
community came in here we financed about
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
a third we financed about 3 million I
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
believe in that project the $10 million
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
bond that was taken locally the company
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
pay I mean those are kind of things the
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
state should be looking at and finding
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
ways to get these projects done so
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing in all these
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
cases further questions to The Honorable
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
Chuck Morris yes representative Sweeney
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
Wonder can we have my Amendment passed
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
around while we have the senator here
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely 1793
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
H they know I was going to be
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for this no I I'll I'll I'll
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
push it Forward I just wanted to keep
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
you as the resource Senator so as
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
Senator mentioned this bill came to us
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
with the $25 million general fund uh
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation which which gave me a
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
little uh setback looking at all the
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
other spending we've been doing uh so
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
this reduces that down to a $2 million
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation and then
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
authorizes a combination of federal
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
funds and the trust fund to 4.5 million
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh just to really get the engineering
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
laid out for the project so that in the
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
next capital budget we can really start
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
tackling the next construction of the of
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
the phases that were being disc
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
there is word uh that the town of Salem
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
secured a $2 million Federal grant that
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
can be utilized as well so it's really I
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
think when it comes down to it it'll be
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
probably 2.5 around that ballpark from
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
the trust fund uh but just to get the
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
engineering started brings it down to
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
that $2 million general fund which I
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
think this committee would probably have
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
a much higher appetite for than the 25
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
million you taught him well he's fairly
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh conservative fiscally so
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
let's back it up a bit No One Secured
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
anything yet on the federal side um we
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
application um that that's been made
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's positive but you know it you never
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
know until these things are done did
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
this project um it will move along and
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
it'll get taken care of this there's
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
also another piece in here though that
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
the committee should be aware of and we
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
left it in here um the the water level
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
in Lake Massabesic if we can raise it a
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
foot a foot I think is what we're
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
shooting for we financed as a state we
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
spent a little bit of money um under
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to do a study in Manchester to
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
raise that Lake that'll basically put
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
another chunk of water into the system
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
um which will allow Manchester to pump
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
um even more to the Southern Tier um
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's a huge benefit to that um that
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
is being chased in federal funds um so
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
we don't describe it in here we just
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned it um but that's part of
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
getting into next year and being able to
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
build out the
 
00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
project now where does that study stand
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
on Massabesic the raising of the water
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
level I why don't you wait when they
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
come up they can answer that question
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
all right it it actually this spring
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
with all this rain shouldn't be a
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
problem it's at that
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
height so yeah I I think the you know
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's other issues in that that have
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be addressed so I think you can ask
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'll seeing
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
done anything else uh oh it's been an
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
honor to come before this committee and
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I look forward to a positive uh
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
outcome thank you well let me just say
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
say this you are missed here by a number
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
of us I could have saved enough money in
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
your budget to pay for this project I
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
knew that was
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
coming thank you very much yeah nice to
 
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
coming thank you very much yeah nice to
see

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
you the Department of Environmental
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
this good morning members you know I
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
always get confused a red light to me
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
should mean it you can't talk yet but
 
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.950 align:start position:0%
should mean it you can't talk yet but
any

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
sorry uh Bob Scott Department of
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so that so that
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
the department hasn't taken a position
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the funding for this project but we
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely support the project and we're
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
very involved in the project and if I
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
could Echo a couple thoughts that the
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
made to date all the work we've done in
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
the Southern New Hampshire tier I I'll
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
equate it to synchronized swimming if
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
you will so you know it takes the
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation and the resources of the
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
local local communities uh the work that
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
has been done that's gone through them
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
they effectively act as a general
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
contractor for it uh and all their and
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
and and devote all those resources so
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
there significant uh in kind match even
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
when they do get grant money uh and then
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
as the senator mentioned too the uh what
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing is the whole model is
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
leveraging their existing uh
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that they have
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
and their willingness to to utilize that
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
to pass water through to other other
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
needed areas of the state um so uh
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps I know the chair asked about the
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
um the lake Massabesic study uh I have
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
with me Mike anger who's a project
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
engineer for everything on this paper uh
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
he perhaps he can give you an update if
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
if the chair would like on when when
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
finished good morning um yes so the it's
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
a feasibility study that Manchester
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
Waterworks has an engineer under
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
contract and paid with Grant funds from
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
Dees and um it's underway now and the
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
final deliverables do in the fall um and
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's the goal is to identify any red
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
flags um and then develop a cost
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
estimate for the final design and
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
construction when's the date oh
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
anger have there been any uh problems at
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
least that have surfaced yet as far as
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
raising the level by a foot or no I
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's the things that you would expect
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um some of the culverts
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh Crossing roads um looking at
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the flows
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
Downstream and you know right now it's
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
just conversations with the different
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
permitting authorities to make sure that
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
the process is outlined but nothing
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
surprising and I think the concept where
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
the money would be likely to be needed
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
is to to uh again raising the level
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
means some Dam dam improvements need to
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
be made to that empowerment so there's
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
some work to be done on the dams the the
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
good news is Manchester Waterworks
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
controls not 100% but most most of the
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
easements around the around the uh the
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
Water body itself also so that that's
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
the good news I would argue you know to
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
the extent this is $3
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
million that we end up putting into this
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully from federal funds um that
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
that that will equate to 1 billion cubic
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
foot of extra water to go into the
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
southern be available for the Southern
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire region so that also
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
provides uh significant backup we've
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
we've had things like past contamination
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
and other things part of that area is
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
getting uh pen Waterworks water uh which
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
is fine too but the the idea of
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
redundancy and and we've done a also for
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
the the region we've we had commissioned
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
a water need study uh going out in the
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
future and there's there's a lot of lot
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
of additional water need that we see
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
coming and that was before epa's recent
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh announcement of this four parts per
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
trillion uh p drinking water standard
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is going to increase the need even
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
more beyond that so so so I say all that
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
to to say the lake Massabesic thing is
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
probably in my experience since I've
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
been commissioner probably the best bank
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
for the buck we're going to see for
 
00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.550 align:start position:0%
for the buck we're going to see for
additional

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
water F the questions for the
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative evil thank
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
you well so I was looking at the
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
amendment and I imagine this is in it's
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
also in the original bill it says um 2
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
million gallons per day to multiple
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
towns impacted by past contamination
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
so how does that interrelate with the
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
stco Bain settlement uh possible EPA
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funding I mean are those
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
all and then of course we have a the
 
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
all and then of course we have a the
lawsuit

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
so yes man a lot of moving parts to that
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
as as you allude to so uh so the the
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
extra 2 million uh gallons per day when
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
we originally uh worked with the
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
communities on the what call phase one
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
to get the water through all the way to
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
to plastow uh it was
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
designed to in the long run be able to
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
to support over 3 3.1 million gallons
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
per day so the pipes were put in at that
 
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
level so we didn't have to go and dig
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
them up and and all that type of stuff
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
in a few years uh so they're they're
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
currently able to with with the the
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks they have right now pumping
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
and treatment they were able to serve
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
that 1.1 million ion gallons this would
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
eventually as as as the senator
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned part 2 A 2 B 2C would would uh
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately get to fruition the full 3.1
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
as envisioned uh having said that again
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
we've had other things happen since then
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
like the past thing as you mentioned so
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the the lake Massabesic uh
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
portion has now been added to give
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
additional Supply uh we do have not on
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
this paper but we're working with uh as
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
a senator mentioned we're working with
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
um lenary that will also uh use both
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester Waterworks and penu uh water
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
also so it is all interrelated and we
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
have as the senator mentioned we have
 
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
certain number of sources and we're
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we can meet all
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
the capacity as that as that is built
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
out sure so my thought there might be
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding in addition to
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
this as well that could help especially
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
from from the P side potentially yes so
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why on the
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
chart you see Federal funding that's a
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
potential for f Federal funding uh also
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
once the water mains are put in you also
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
have to get the water to the the Final
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
End uh that's definitely an area where
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
used so no further questions uh the
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
division okay with this representative
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
Sweeny's Amendment just show a hands
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
please all
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
much so now if um the division is happy
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
we can vote on um Senate Bill 393 as
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
amended with this Sweeney
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment make that
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
motion okay the motion's been made by
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney seconded by
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative EO
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
get my world in order here thanks Joe
 
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes representa Griffin yes

unanimous okay the motion passes 8 to
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
zero okay we'll move right along to uh
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 453 making an appropriation
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the Statewide voter registration
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
system we have someone here that wishes
 
00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:54.829 align:start position:0%
system we have someone here that wishes
to

00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't think of an amendment for
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um I think it's a worthwhile
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
thing to do um the only possibility is I
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't feel like it's a super high
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
priority so if we actually knew how much
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
money we have to spend you know and and
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's and we're short 450,000 I would say
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
maybe delay it right but other than that
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
I you know I guess I'm going to move um
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
octopath okay the motion's been made on
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
seconding seeing no further discussion
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
when the clerk is ready please call the
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
rooll on a to pass on
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
453 hang on hang on
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
hang I mean perhaps because
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is is a member of
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%

Lan please support this it's been a high
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
priority of the election committee for
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
you okay so um if people could tell me
 
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
who said seconded the motion that would
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
was made by represent Maguire seconded
 
00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:34.990 align:start position:0%
was made by represent Maguire seconded
by

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
Griff okay all right representative
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire yes representative Griffin yes
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell yes clerk votes
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lane yes
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes the chair yes
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
okay we have a few more minutes until we
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:25.549 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
but I I it's not really in my mind
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional to to vote a benefit for
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
a specific group family person Etc right
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's part one article 10 um so but
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
but I think that I mean this particular
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
case is one that uh should be Ben you
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
know should have such a benefit and um
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
so I so what this amendment does is it
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
does provide the benefit for the hos
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
family but it
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
also uh going forward provides a similar
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
benefit to others in a similar situation
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
right so so there's two there's two
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
parts to this the the first one is to
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
add um security officers so this line 24
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a big list of those people
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
that that qualify for this particular
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
benefit and and so line 64 adds security
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
officers to the list the reason that um
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
Chief hos was not included was he was on
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
he was he had been a long time law
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer but at the time he
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
was a security officer um and I and he
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
was only part-time I believe right so um
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
so this adds security officers to the
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
list and then this but the second part
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
is lines 15 through 18 so two years ago
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit in
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
question added suicide to the ca
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
possible causes of death that includ
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
include this and the argument at the
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
time was that law enforcement officers
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
who commit
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
suicide T often are victims of PTSD you
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
know it's the stress of the job that's
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
driving them to suicide and so um so
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's why the legislature and the
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
governor added suicide as a cause but
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me that if someone is
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
in a part-time job then the then that
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
justification isn't really there right
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
so so if you're only part-time law
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement security
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
Etc then then the justification for
 
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
suicide you know for example um
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know hos was in a a part-time
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
sort of position that's not really there
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
so this adds a little language that says
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
only if you're full-time does the
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
suicide um aspect of this count so so it
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
seems to me both of these parts are
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
related to hos they make H's situ
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
situation get the benefit in a in a more
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
General way and the house family does
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
benefit thank you questions for
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire represent graphy
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
no nothing
 
00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:27.950 align:start position:0%
no nothing
represent

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
Lane I know I'm a sub but I guess my
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
question is um this seems to be a type
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
of a policy decision rather than a
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
financial decision and is this something
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
that was discussed in the policy
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes unfortunately as
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative grassy said welcome to
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
finance we often get
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
into policy which is tied into fin
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
Financial aspects
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
so I can see a point where you might
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
suggest it should go to Edna for
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
instance which deal deals with these
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
types of issues but go ahead I I guess
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
my followup is was
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
this addition discussed Below in the
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
policy uh represent McGuire could answer
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
that but I'm guessing
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
no unfortunately this this is a Senate
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
bill it came to us as first committee
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
right right so you know I mean the the
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
speaker could have sent it to Edna as
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
first committee and us as second
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
committee but in this case we're kind of
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
right further questions representative
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
evil it's not a question it's a comment
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
um I actually
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
like what representative Maguire has
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
done um because uh I can think of
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
several situations where the state has
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
been asked to provide some sort of
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
support for the family or some sort of
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
death benefit in an unfortunate um
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
situation and this way if we have this
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
as a as a matter of Statute then we can
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
just go back to the statute and these
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
families and there and whoever is
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
representing them um don't don't have to
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
go through the painful process of H
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
through any further comments represent
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
Kells yes thank you Mr chair yeah uh I
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
also like the bill like the way with the
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
amendment um the question is it's still
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay represent Maguire yeah so the the
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
100,000 is the standard amount for a
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
death benefit of a law enforcement
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
officer in who gets killed on the job
 
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.750 align:start position:0%
officer in who gets killed on the job
basically

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions or someone
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
motion representative Griffin followed
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
by representative Sweeney making a
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
second Is there further

to the bill I know from Senator
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
rosenwall there's an amendment that
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
someone's going to
 
01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:08.510 align:start position:0%
someone's going to
present

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
thanks Senator
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
rosenwall you're welcome to come forward
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
if you'd like I believe you have an
 
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:29.950 align:start position:0%
if you'd like I believe you have an
amendment

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
um it's suggested language for the
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
record Cindy rosenal from Senate
 
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.430 align:start position:0%
record Cindy rosenal from Senate
District

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
13 this amendment steps back from the
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill that I introduced to you a couple
 
01:06:45.279 --> 01:06:46.390 align:start position:0%
bill that I introduced to you a couple
weeks

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
ago um it feels like a lifetime ago but
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
I think it was only about two or three
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
weeks ago um it steps back from the
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
requirement that 100% of the PDP
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
funds um be invested in financial
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
institutions with a presence in New
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it um takes the lead from
 
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it um takes the lead from
RSA

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
48 colon 16 which has to do with how
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal funds
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
can be invested have to be secured so
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
that is what you now see as
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
section one and that's the only
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
language that is different I would also
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
point out that down at the bottom of
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
this section one
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
2A there is a
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
target requirement not a floor but a
 
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.150 align:start position:0%
target requirement not a floor but a
goal

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.630 align:start position:0%
goal
of

01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
saying at least
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
30% of the
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
funds in the pool should
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
um banks with a footprint here it's a
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
goal I know that the treasurer has
 
01:08:21.239 --> 01:08:23.070 align:start position:0%
goal I know that the treasurer has
some

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
comments on this language I think it's
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know we listen to the comments of
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
the towns that came in to testify I
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
think this language adheres to the pdip
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
statute which puts Safety
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
compromise

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
chair good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record State
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
mipel so um uh Senator Ren W was very
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
kind to share that Amendment with me and
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
um uh was able to review the amendment
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
and um I think um it was it's it's it's
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
clear that um um there is this
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
understanding that um you know based on
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the feedback from the from the um public
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and and that's why this this
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendment uh was uh developed um my my
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
comment and I was just had of just a
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
minute to to right I didn't have the
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with Senator Rosen
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
before but my my comment um to to to
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen wall is um um I still have
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit of concern um uh even
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
though this amend then is including more
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
Investments um that the pool can invest
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
in I still am a little concerned that we
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
have some limitations in the number of
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
Investments um that we that the pool
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
will be allowed to invest in um when we
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
start trying to list the type of
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
Investments you could the risk is that
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
you could live out some potential
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
options um for you know for the pool to
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
invest just like right now we do have a
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
wide um range of options that the pool
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh can utilize and um my concern about
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
limit ends and putting investments in in
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
the law is that for some reason
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
something um if the market conditions
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
change or um I was just using the
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
example of um when the debt limit the US
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
government was having some trouble
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
reaching to that deal um we were a
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
little concerned that the US government
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
was going to um um not meet um its
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
obligations so we reduce our position on
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
US government for some time and so again
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
in is and that's one of the safest that
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
is the safest investment as far as we we
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
know and um and again so I guess my
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
point is adding limitations to the law
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
could all could create unintended
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
consequences um one of the things that I
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
I I was hearing and I think the the
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
intent of this is try to uh protect the
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
pool which I completely understand um
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
and again the concern is for example the
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
the state this the state of New
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have a limitation we
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
have the ability to um invest in a lot
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
of type of uh Investments according to
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 68 uh but the way we address that
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
even though we have that very wide range
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
of options to invest this we address
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
those limits and those parameters in our
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
investment policies so that's um that
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
was sort of that's my intention um and
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
that was the conversation I wanted to
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
have with the senator and the bankers
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Association because I think we could
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably try to address some of um the
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
desire to have more investments in New
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we could probably try to
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
do it in the investment policy rather
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
than um impacting the law um and then
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
create unintended consequences that way
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
so that's what I wanted to again share
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
with the senator and the group but also
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
um for this committee to to consider uh
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
again this will impact not only this
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but the current amendment that
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're or the current uh proposal that
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're reviewing today and if I could um
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at RSA 48 col 16 that
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
limits the amount the places that
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
City treasurers called called City
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
treasurers I think probably applies to
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
towns too limits the the places that
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
they can make their Investments to
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
government um US
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
government uh
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
instruments and federally insured
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
banks with language about the amount how
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the funds are secured so so there's law
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
about this for the cities that this
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
language is based on one thing I think
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
you could do to address the treasurer's
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
concerns is
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
in um the sentence that says beginning
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
June 22nd
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
20125 you could say any private
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
investment advisor approved by the state
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
treasur and advisory committee shall
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
strive to ensure and that is is
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with the language in Roman 2A
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
so it would be a Target but it would be
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature saying our intent is
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
that these funds be invested in Secure
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
instruments and I don't know how you
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
react to
 
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
that yes on the Fly Right
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I think I think
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
including the intent and the law I think
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate that we could
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
take that message back to the committee
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
reviewing and the investment policy
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
could be designed uh again understand
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
that there is this desire to have more
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
more Investments and you know Banks
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire we can
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainly address that uh we can review
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and we can
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
try to mimic some some of that
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that perhaps because of
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
the number of banks operating in New
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh perhaps that you know we're
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
not going to be the same as New York uh
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
but if we could try to we could try to
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
reach a Target that again tries to meet
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
this desire to keep more funds in the
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
state but providing us that again the
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility to invest in other
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
Securities that also are um important to
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
maintain the stability of the funds and
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
also um um you know we use uh is that
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
have the highest credit that will allow
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
us to improve the yield and the pool and
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we all um you know we all
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
have this fidare responsibility to um uh
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
to to to obtain you know maintain those
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
funds preserve the funds and and obtain
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
the highest yield that we can possibly
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh can reach so those are my comments so
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
just for the division as far as the
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
history of this bill this came directly
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
to us from the Senate we had a public
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on the 17th of
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
April um the vote out of the Senate
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
which was back on February 24th or 21st
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
rather was 24 to Z representative
 
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
Griffin you had a question thank you Mr
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
my question is to the state treasurer I
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
have a background of having been a
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
selectman five terms I was a town
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Treasurer I the investment pool as it
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
exists is a great great
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
institution the goal of the pool is to
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
maximize Returns on extra money and uh
 
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
within the margin of
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
safety and uh I'm my question I guess is
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in your mind fixing something
 
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
broken the pool is is a very successful
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
pool is not fixing a broken pool the
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
pool is a successful pool um but because
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
um it is a successful pool and and we
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
the the am the Investments um we're not
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're not only investing in New
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for sure we have some
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
Investments not only uh in US treasuries
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
we have Investments um of um other banks
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
that operate in in the country so those
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
are the ones you know large large large
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
Banks um large corporations so we have
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to invest in those in those
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
compan companies um so no I guess to
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
answer your question is is not broken
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very successful pool it has the
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
highest rating um that s SMP can um
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
award um so um hopefully that answers
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
your question could I answer
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
that thank you so it no one is
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's something wrong
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
pool however we're I think we're missing
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
to have some portion of New Hampshire
 
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
to have some portion of New Hampshire
taxpayer

01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
funds be
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
reinvested in our communities and become
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
available for commercial lending for
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
retail lending and if you recall from
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
April 17th briyan got's study indicated
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
that when you looked at property tax
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
Collections and room and meals
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
collections primarily also business
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
taxes on a state level there would be a
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
secondary positive Revenue impact for
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
Beyond just looking at the rate of
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
return so that's the reason for this
 
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
return so that's the reason for this
bill

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
grassy yes this is a question for the
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
treasurer as well um the city of Ro does
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
not belong to the pool they're not
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
investing in the pool they invest their
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
money in a private investment firm um my
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
concern is if this bill would pass and
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
it would in some way create a situation
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
where the pool would have lower returns
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
could this force a lot of towns who are
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
currently invested in the pool maybe to
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
drop out and go with a private
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
investment firm instead of the pool or
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
with the banks uh if they feel they're
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
getting they getting a better rate which
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
I have this feeling that some of these
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
and I spoke to my treasure Treasurer
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
about it that you know investing in a
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
private firm um I don't look at as being
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
as safe as investing in the pool and you
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
know that's a concern would you could
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
you see that this would could drive
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
towns not into the banks but into
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
private investment
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
firms that is definitely the risk I mean
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
again trying to make a change that will
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're creating unintended
 
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.310 align:start position:0%
you know we're creating unintended
consequences

01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
um that is the risk the risk is um you
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
know even though we will try to manage
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh the portfolio manager is going to try
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
to um meet the requirements of a change
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the law but if for some reason
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong then you lose the
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
um the confidence of investors and
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
investors will take their money out and
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
once that happens then you no longer
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
have a successful pool we have a higher
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
ratio expense ratio to to operate um you
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
know with less funds so right now what
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
makes it a successful pool is that
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
people have confidence that the pool is
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
has the highest rating um the towns and
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
cities have been able to invest their
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
funds the state New Hampshire has a a
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
position in that in this pool so I'm
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
very confident that the money is there
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
safe um because it maintains the highest
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
rting in order to maintain the highest
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
rating you need to have a lot of um
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
controls in place um you know follow the
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
guidance of the investment adviser plus
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
you know having a strong investment
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
policy there are a lot of pieces I mean
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the myself and um and the and the
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee meets on a quarterly
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
basis to to monitor this performance so
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of pieces that are are
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
you need to have in place to make it
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
work so again an unintended consequence
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
if we change the law that that is my
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
concern and this is why uh I just wanted
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
to mention um the
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you both oh yes
 
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.470 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you both oh yes
representa

01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you um take my question
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say that you could
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
address some of these issues through
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
policy changes and not and would not
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
require a statutory
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
change that that's exactly what I said
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh I think we could
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
try to again understanding there is this
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
desire to try to have a a um um you know
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
more deposits in the state so the so the
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
banks operating and the state can do
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
more lending and all of that I think we
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
can look at what all the states I do and
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's there were some examples um
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
shared with us um the state of Missouri
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New York they do have some
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of requirement that um in their
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
investment policy to to to deposit a
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
portion of the funds that are invested
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
in the pool and those funds operating in
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
in those States so I think we could look
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
at that we could try to achieve you know
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
a goal that again we will leave more
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
funds in this the state so there are
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
some risks of course because um you know
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's some costs you know
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know if we if we want to
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
leave some more funds in the state
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps um the yield could be impacted
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
but we'll consider all of that as part
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
of what we reviewing and and I think we
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
could probably find a a a sweet spot and
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
but but again address it in the
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
investment policy um rather than the law
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the the cities and towns have a
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
requirement to have an investment policy
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
um so themselves can um you know decide
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
how much money they want to um save in
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
the pool already so I think we all we
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
all uh all treasurers um have to abide
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
by this investment policies in order to
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
make the decisions that work for again
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
for the state and cities and towns and
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know in their cases can I you're
 
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
welcome to senat Rose thank
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
you right now the
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
um investment
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
policy allows for investment into
 
01:23:34.159 --> 01:23:35.629 align:start position:0%
policy allows for investment into
financial

01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
institutions in New Hampshire however
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
there are zero
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
so yet I think trust would
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
verify if if our goal is to maintain the
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
safety which is the top priority of the
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
pp in statute but also ensure a good
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
return and all and finally grab those
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
tax revenue impacts that we know we will
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
get I think it would
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
be I think it would be wise to move
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
forward with at least targets
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
on what the Investments can be and what
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
a goal for banks
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
is but not set an absolute
 
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.790 align:start position:0%
is but not set an absolute
floor

01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
because we can leave it to the
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
investment policy and then just not see
 
01:24:45.199 --> 01:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
investment policy and then just not see
a

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
change represent McGuire has a few
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
you for coming um Madame Treasurer
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's an advisory committee that um
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
you are a member of and and um sets
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
policy for the fund um and that advisory
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee has some members of New
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers on it is are the
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
meetings of this committee contentious I
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
mean do you do
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
you you know is it all against the
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
bankers or something like that or is
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in generally an
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
agreement on decisions thank you for the
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
question I I um this bill um has made
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
some uh interesting um reactions you
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
know during the meetings but I think
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
um my experience with with this board
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
has been you know always everybody gives
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
along fine it's just I think that
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
discussion you know again trying to the
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
discussion related to this bill has has
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
become a little more um um contentious
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh during our meetings but I think but
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's another opportunity I
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
guess going forward I think you know
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
having a me the members from the bankers
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
Association and also members of
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
participants of the pool I think going
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
forward could allow us to again what
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
what Senator rosenal is is is trying to
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
um accomplish here is to try to find a a
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
compromise right to try to so so um it
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
it is correct that this pool has not
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
been able to
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
um leave funds in this in the state but
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh but it is possible to put a mandate
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
and the policy and try to achieve that
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
um we can certainly look into that I'm
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
always I'm always um um I've had the
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
oversight of the pool only for less than
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
a year so we haven't had the opportunity
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
to to review all aspects of you know
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
what the pool should be um review the
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
investment policy has been around for
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
some time so this is also opportunity to
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
review the investment policy um with the
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee members hopefully I answer
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
your question yes thank you thank you
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
may I follow sure thank you so um the
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
key part of this bill that uh it seems
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
to me is uh on line nine the words
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
insured or
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
collateralized so my maybe naive
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
understanding when I invest in say a CD
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
or something I get FDIC insurance
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
but it's only up to
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and and so I'm careful not to
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
put more than that in any given bank
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
right for some strange reason I can have
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
as arbitrary amount of FDI insurance if
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
I put some in this bank and some in that
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
bank some like that but if I put it all
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
in one bank it goes away you know it's
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
not there but this is way more than
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
$250,000 so I assume this what this is
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of insurance
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
is not FDIC Insurance am I right or am I
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
wrong I think it would be a combination
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
of of I think what the bill is is is
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
saying it could be a combination of DIC
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
insurance and other type of collateral
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
um so um some banks use some products
 
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
that um utilize FDIC insurance and and
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
this particular product goes and finds
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
collateral and in other Banks throughout
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
the state throughout the country uh but
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
there are other forms of collateral it
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be us treasuries although
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
obligations um uh layers of credit those
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
are common and and more secure uh ways
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
of to collateralize in addition to FDIC
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance all right let me one more so
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
if something is insured or
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
collateralized is is that kind of the
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
difference the reason that that causes
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
lower interest rates is because what
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
you're investing in now is something
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
like commercial paper which doesn't have
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and this would and therefore
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
one is a higher interest rate and the
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
other is lower is that right I think the
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
interest rates depend on the the banks
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
all banks have different policies and
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to set different
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
rates collateral definitely cost uh
 
01:29:14.189 --> 01:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
there's a cost um always there's only I
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly how much I I think
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's one Bank mentioned 12 basis
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
points for for the cost of collateral
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
but I think that the I'm not really sure
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's across the board but it does cost
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
money so I think um the rate is impacted
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
by their business and also their ability
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
to collateralize
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
funds thank you are we ready for a
 
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.790 align:start position:0%
funds thank you are we ready for a
motion

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
or are there any more questions for the
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
state treasurer of Senator
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
rosenwall seeing
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
none um we are ready for a motion
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I'd like to move
 
01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I'd like to move
interim

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
study and I'd like to talk about that
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
and it's seconded by representative wer
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
so I spent some time yesterday with OS
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
to to ask about you know to talk about
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
possibly amending this bill because my
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
original thought was what we heard at
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
the public hearing was that the people
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
who are invested in this bill the
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
various Town Treasures County treasures
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and so on they liked it and they don't
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
want us to to mess with right and so um
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I was I had the idea that well uh but
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand you know in deference
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
to the Senate which was unanimous on
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um why don't we have two pools
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
right and let the people who invest in
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
it decide do I want it the one way that
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have it now or do I want it the way
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
that that this uh this bill would change
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
it to and then let the various counties
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
and towns and so on decide how do they
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
want to invest their money and so we
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
went I went around with the um with OS
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
talking about that and it turns out that
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
effectively what we have now in law is
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
that right because there's a law which
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
tells towns here's how you can invest
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
your money and one choice is p dip and
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
the other choice is
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right but but there's there is
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
yet another maybe there's another
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
section and maybe it's certain kinds of
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
funds certain kinds of town monies can't
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
be that way I don't know anyways what
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
what we saw in the law was it's either P
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
dip or or Banks maybe there's some other
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
choice that we miss but um but the point
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
is it seems to me that we already
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
have um uh a lot of choice right and and
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
so therefore the amendment I was
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
considering didn't make sense to me
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
because because it seems to be that's
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
what existing law is and so but maybe
 
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
there's a germ of an idea here and so
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
therefore interim study instead of
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
itl Representative Griffin Follow by
 
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative grass you I think had a
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
question um when I first read this bill
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
it appears to me it was a great idea and
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
then we heard
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and I noticed that most of the
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
people who sent emails and testified
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
against it were members of the
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
pool and most of the people who
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
testified for it were not members of the
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
pool so I changed my mind 100% I I would
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
itl this bill but interim study is
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this is one of the things
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
that when I sit down with my finance
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
director and and and we talked about
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
where Rochester Rochester invested their
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
surplus funds in Bar Harbor trust it's a
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
formerly a Rochester company so they
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
have some you know some personal
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
relationships there I suppose but the
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
concern that I had and I expressed to
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
them and I said you know what are you
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
getting for a rate and I said you could
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
probably get a rate better rate with the
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
pool and I said and what happens if one
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the partners abcon with a bunch of
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
money um you know you've got no
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
protection and it was like oh yeah okay
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so you know the thing is is that uh
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know not that barab is going tosone
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
with their money they're a reputable
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
company but the thing is is that a town
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
could invest in a company like that
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
which would be very unsecure and that's
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have is that you know
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
you don't you have more choices and I
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to really encourage people to
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
invest in private companies that are out
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
there Loosey Goosey um accepting
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
deposits from communities um you know
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
they may come up with a good proposal
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
for you and you invest your money and
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden the money's gone um
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
I I think what we have now is a safe
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
situation and I would hate to see that
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
change I'm not opposed to itl to take a
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
look at this but um or inim I mean inm
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
Stud I'm not opposed to inm study to
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at this but you know my town
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
has said you know we don't think it
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
should change and but my county has said
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
they don't think it should change
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
so representa Sweeny name is chairman I
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate all all everyone's
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
position on this only wondering if the
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee would indulge a day delay on
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
the vote till tomorrow afternoon uh
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
there may be an agreement that can be
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
reached uh on some ver version of the
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill if we just had an extra day if that
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable with I would I would
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
support that I mean there's so much
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
interest and concern on both sides in
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it makes good sense
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
not to act really hastily on it where
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
pres McGuire are you okay with
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
that um it's really are you CU you won't
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
be here tomorrow
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
so representative hacken Phillips will
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
be sitting in for me tomorrow so okay
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I don't mind it's it's the
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
similar to interim study right a delay
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
one day of interim
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
study all right so we will uh recess
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
until let's see
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
end of the end of the day
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow all right so just it's clear
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
this will be uh heard again tomorrow at
 
01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:52.629 align:start position:0%
