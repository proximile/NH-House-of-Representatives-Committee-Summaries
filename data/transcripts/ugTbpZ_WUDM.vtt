00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chairman and
 
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
members of the labor committee
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to introduce
 
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 align:start position:0%
hp 1053 a bill which would provide time
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
and a half for any employee who was
 
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 align:start position:0%
asked or more often called in to work
 
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
hours with which they were not
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
previously scheduled
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is on
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
the other side of the coin of hb 1094
 
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 align:start position:0%
bill will hear later
 
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
that would require employees receive at
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
least seven day notice of their rest
 
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
least seven day notice of their rest
periods

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
it wasn't coordinated but this feels
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
kind of like an ever or
 
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
if the house finds it unnecessary or
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous for
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
two employers for them to have to notify
 
00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
an employee a week ahead of time what
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
their schedule is expected to be then
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
they at least then the least they could
 
00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
do is pay them a little more for the
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
sacrifice that employee is making for
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the company whether it's
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
through surprise scheduling or being
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
called into work the idea behind the
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill is simple employees have lives
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
they may use their time off to do chores
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
or errands or spend time with their
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
loved ones or god forbid rest
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
the bill does two things to help secure
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that time off it first ensures that an
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
employer really needs that employee to
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
come in by making it so they have to be
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
paid a little more
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
and be paid the time and half for their
 
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
and be paid the time and half for their
work

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing it does is that if the
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
employer decides yeah we do really need
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
you to come in that employee is better
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
compensated for having to rearrange
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
their schedule because there are often
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that i want to
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
refer really quickly to a recent article
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
in nh business review and i want to
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
preface um that i really appreciate the
 
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
folks they quoted on the other side of
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
the debate on this bill i love the
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
timberland owners i love their employees
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
i submitted biomass legislation the 2020
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
session so this isn't in any way
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
adversarial to them but it's definitely
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
a disagreement
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
um the mem person that they quoted said
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
quote you take a shot of rain and say
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
take the afternoon off let's work all
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
day on saturday and then they'll say pay
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
me overtime it wasn't scheduled which is
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
frankly the point of the bill
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
i want to deconstruct that bit about the
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
surprise saturday scheduling
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
logging in timber employee expects to
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
have that saturday off maybe his kid has
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
a community center soccer game maybe
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's the only day he can get during
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
the day or during the week to visit a
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
family member in a nursing home who's an
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
hour away if he lives in any of the
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
northern counties
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they planned on spending that day
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
coaching or resting or anything
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
presumably that person had made plans
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
for that day
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
9 a.m boss sends a text that says it's
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
raining see you on saturday at 9. well
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
now that person is in the position of
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
not only having to rearrange all of that
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
if they're so lucky to be able to but if
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
they have a younger kid and their
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
parents were like mine growing up where
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
they worked opposite schedules to try to
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
get out of child care
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
well now they have 48 hours to try to
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
find child care that either doesn't
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
exist or it's more expensive because
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's the weekend and and last minute and
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know what frankly after that yes i
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
do think that person deserves time and a
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
half for that trouble it's not just
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
weather dependent jobs many low wage 29
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
hour a week employee or employers also
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
keep their employees in this awful
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
guessing game about when they're working
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and when they're needed and even some
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
40-hour a week employers do this as well
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
i want to extend some power to those
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
employees to help balance that
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
relationship out a little bit and as
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
such i would ask the committee otp this
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any uh
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
questions for representative adjutant
 
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
questions for representative adjutant
representative

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
how would this bill interact if the
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
employee was already due time and a half
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
due to having worked that many hours
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is a good question that i honestly
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay a follow-up
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
could you foresee that maybe an employee
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
if they had an employer if they had two
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
employees one that was
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
already over the number of hours where
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
they had to be paid time and a half and
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
one that wasn't
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
they might focus all the unscheduled
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
work on the employee that was already
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
due time and a half because
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
at least according to one reading this
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill it would be no different
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
because that employee would already be
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
um well if
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
if i understand the question and uh the
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
second employee has less hours on the
 
00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
second employee has less hours on the
schedule

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
um then
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
i believe you know that would be
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
shifting the hours around in a way that
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
protects as much time off for both
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
avalon

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
avalon
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for the
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying today
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
taking our questions
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
salary employees are in a position
 
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
salary employees are in a position
already

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.830 align:start position:0%
already
where

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
their hours are
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
pretty well dictated by their employer
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that they would be
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
amenable to this
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
or i don't think this would impact that
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um so if a salaried employee
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
was to cover a shift for a
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
hourly employee or vice versa would the
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
hourly employee be mandated the employer
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
be mandated to pay the hourly employee
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
time and a half but not the salary
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
employee for covering the same shift
 
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
employee for covering the same shift
if

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that would be the case
 
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.790 align:start position:0%
i believe that would be the case
um

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.909 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
if the hours are unscheduled and they're
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
not in a salary agreement where
 
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
not in a salary agreement where
they

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
their hours are
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
less structured in a typical nine to
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
five or eight to four setting
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
and one last follow-up mr chairman one
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
blast follow-up thank you and how would
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
this apply to part-time employees is it
 
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.630 align:start position:0%
this apply to part-time employees is it
still

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
where employers only open four or five
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
hours a day and an employee comes in for
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
covers that four or five hour shift
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
still mandated to pay time and half to
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that part-time employee yes
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
could you turn on your mike
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr sharon thank you
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that sometimes
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
employers will penalize the employee for
 
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.389 align:start position:0%
employers will penalize the employee for
declining

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
declining
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come in the
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
unscheduled hours
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
i i thank you for the question that i
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
would um i would absolutely believe that
 
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
would um i would absolutely believe that
um

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
the the main thrust of the bill is to
 
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.230 align:start position:0%
the the main thrust of the bill is to
provide

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
power balance between the employer and
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
employee as far as
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
time that that employee originally
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
perceived they had off uh it raises a
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
stake for the employer a little bit
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
to say okay well i really need you to
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand that you're sacrificing
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
personal life things uh such as any of
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the family commitments that i had
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned and as a consequence of that
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to receive uh more in
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
pay so that is the intention there
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
representative

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have many many cards on this bill um
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning thank you for the
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
record rudy ogden deputy commissioner
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
department of labor um my being mindful
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's time i don't want to be
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
overly redundant i would say that for
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of administration of this bill
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
we did have same or some of the similar
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
questions to what we've heard
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
namely how would payment be handled in
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
certain scenarios our reading of this
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill would suggest that salaried
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
individuals would not be entitled
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
to an enhancement additionally per diem
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
employees would not be entitled to an
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
enhancement but that's just something we
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
wanted clarification on
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
because as presently prescribed we would
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
see it as not
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
allowing for them to get an enhancement
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
the other question we had relative to
 
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
the other question we had relative to
administration

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
i know there's a bill later on uh hb
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
1094 dealing with scheduling
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
but i think that one thing to note is
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
not all employers have what would be
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
considered a static or clearly
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
established scheduling procedure so
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
where this talks about
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
employees subject to a change in
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
scheduling outside of the normal
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling procedure we would just want
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know if we're dealing with an
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
employer that has a little bit of a more
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
ad hoc scheduling which is problematic
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
to folks certainly but we would just
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to know in terms of how that should
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
be addressed would it be that those
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
individuals would not be subject uh to
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
this type of enhancement or premium pay
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
um so i'm happy to take uh any questions
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
or answer any questions the only thing i
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
would offer answer from what i've heard
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
is representative avaloni when you
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
talked about salaried salaried folks as
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative edge and said generally
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
they're not you know they're they're
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
being paid their set salary regardless
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
of hours worked uh so it would not again
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
for the reason being we would not see
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
there being an enhancement here in those
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr ogden any
 
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:17.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr ogden any

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%

for being here today um
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
the question i have is if an employer
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
has two employees and they decide to do
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make a week's pay
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
what recourse would the employer have if
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
so the employer is then calling the
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
other one and saying they have to come
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
in they have to come in and cover that
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
shift because their friend called in and
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
can't come to work
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
as for the terms of what the proposed
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is they'd be entitled to the
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%

hampshire's tourism community
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
and in the tourism community as you may
 
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
and in the tourism community as you may
know

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
many factors that go into scheduling
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and probably the biggest factor
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
is one that
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
i am not able to control the weather
 
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.350 align:start position:0%
i am not able to control the weather
and

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
the weather has a major impact on
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling of employees at these
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
different facilities throughout the
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.870 align:start position:0%
and it is
very

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
hectic at times to to get a full staff
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that is especially true today
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
shortage of employees and so to have
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
the dictates of house bill 1053
 
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.670 align:start position:0%
the dictates of house bill 1053
um

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
laid upon them during
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
their process of ensuring that they have
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
the correct number of employees to
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
serve the
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
visiting public
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
it is really important that
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the point that
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
the deputy commissioner made about
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling not being static
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
very very true in the tourism sector of
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
our state's business community
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons we are in
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and i'd be happy
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
to address any questions you may have
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for mr
 
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.470 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for mr

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative mendel

yes thank you for your testimony here
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
today i wonder if the entities you
 
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
today i wonder if the entities you
represent

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
on whether the proposed
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would actually
 
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
legislation would actually
enhance

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
enhance
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
the workforce
staffing

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances by
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
attracting workers to our state by
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
virtue of this protection
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
well representative and i'm sorry i
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
didn't get your name
 
00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.189 align:start position:0%

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
the the circumstances under which these
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are operating in new
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire today are are very difficult
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
due to that shortage
 
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.310 align:start position:0%
due to that shortage
and

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
any added costs
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
to their business operations
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
will have an impact on
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
hours offered
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
shifts offered to employees as well as
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
adding new jobs
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so with a finite amount of money
 
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
and so with a finite amount of money
involved

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
just you know provide for
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
time and a half situations or
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other thank you mr cube

served on as i was thinking about it i
 
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.669 align:start position:0%
served on as i was thinking about it i
think

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
10 years ago now
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
time time goes quickly when you're
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
having fun
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
i'm here in opposition to the to the
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill as it applies to to agriculture
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
which is also another
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
industry that's very dependent on the
 
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
industry that's very dependent on the
weather

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
weather
 
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.630 align:start position:0%
weather
and

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
it can certainly speak to the fact that
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
agriculture does not tend to be
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
a overly profitable business in the
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire most most people
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
farm because they they love it
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily bring them a lot of
 
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily bring them a lot of
financial

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
profit and certainly from year to year
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
that can be very difficult and when the
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.909 align:start position:0%
 
schedules

00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
or call people in at the last last
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
minute and so to actually have to tie
 
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
minute and so to actually have to tie
um

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
or pay time and a half
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
when you call somebody in when you
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't scheduled them because it's
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
either suddenly going to rain and you've
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
got to get the hay or vegetables or
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
other things and
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
there isn't the money
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
to back this up
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider this very carefully
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
the negative and it would definitely be
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
a negative impact
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
on agriculture if farmers suddenly had
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
to start paying time and a half every
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
time they had to call
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
workers in because of the
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
weather or possibly other emergencies
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
such as situations if you're milking
 
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
such as situations if you're milking
cows

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
cows
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
and suddenly somebody calls out sick and
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
you've got to call somebody in at the
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
last last minute they're not going to
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
get any more money for that that milk
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
but those cows have to be milked on
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
on schedule
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
eggs have to be picked you know at a
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
certain time whatever it is agriculture
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
is on a schedule you can't simply say
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
well we'll wait till tomorrow when
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
people come in
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
so this this could have a very very
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
negative impact on agriculture in new
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'll leave it at that and be
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%

there are others behind me who will also
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
be opposing the bill i just want to
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
employers in new hampshire
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
are having to deal with a couple of
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
different environments one is the
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
environment that has been created by the
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
coven 19 pandemic and that's affecting
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
employers in a couple of different ways
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
the first is it's infecting it's
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
affecting their revenue coming into
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
their places of business if you're a
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner or if you own a small
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
retail store if you
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
own some type of lodging
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
you're impacted by the fact that people
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
aren't traveling the way they were
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
pre-covered people aren't going out to
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
eat the way they were pre-covered people
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
aren't coming into uh bricks and mortar
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
retail stores the way they were
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
pre-coveted so your revenue is already
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
likely down
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
the second impact that
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think is even more directly related to
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill with covet 19
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that most if not all employers have
 
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
is that most if not all employers have
implemented

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
implemented
different

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic related rules for coming into
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
the workplace
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
used to be pre-code if you had a sniffle
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
many people would just show up at work
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the case any longer employers
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
are saying if you have any type of
 
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.789 align:start position:0%
are saying if you have any type of
symptom

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
symptom
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
sniffles sore throat headache anything
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
stay home
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
shortages of labor that the bill is
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
envisioning are actually quite common
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
now and completely out of the employer's
 
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.270 align:start position:0%
now and completely out of the employer's
control

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
the other environment i want to remind
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
the committee that employers are having
 
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.909 align:start position:0%
the committee that employers are having
to

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge now is a significant
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
shortage of labor i moved to new
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 1990 so i'm not a lifelong
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
granite stater but i've been here a
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
while i've worked for the bia for 22
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
years i can't remember
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
a time where there was as significant a
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
labor shortage in the state as there is
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
now that employers are having to deal
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
with i have one manufacturing member
 
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
with i have one manufacturing member
uh

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the monadnock region who says his
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
criteria for hiring people now is if
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
they can pass a drug test and fog a
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
mirror that's how desperate he is for
 
00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
mirror that's how desperate he is for
employees

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
so to get to a representative cahill's
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe question
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes i'd be willing to believe that there
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
may be employers out there that
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
may take punitive action if they request
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
an employee to come in for unscheduled
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
time but i would suggest that's an
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
employer that may be out of business
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
pretty soon because there are plenty of
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
job opportunities for employees who are
 
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.630 align:start position:0%
job opportunities for employees who are
unhappy

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.430 align:start position:0%
unhappy
in

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
their work situation i would suggest
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
that many employees
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
are happy to come into work if they're
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
able to to get the extra dollars so i
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
would ask that you find this bill in
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
expedient it's it's not good public
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy and it's especially bad at this
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
time in our history thank you mr chair
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
giuvet any questions representative
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr duvet
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
employers are having to pay more per
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
employee now than they did pre-coded
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's no question that that is
 
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.789 align:start position:0%
there's no question that that is
happening

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
they're having you know the the question
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the minimum wage often comes up
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh as we all know that most if not
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
all employers around the state are
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
paying far higher than the minimum wage
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
before covet hit but they're certainly
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
having to pay more now in fact i often
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
get questions from
 
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
get questions from
members

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
calling me asking
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
what are other employers doing how high
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
do we have to go what what is the market
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
right now so there is absolutely no
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
question that that's taking place i
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
would also add that many employers
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that calling someone in for
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
unscheduled work could be a burden
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
and if the individual says that they
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't well then they
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't but for those who say
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
employers are often doing a lot and i'll
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
use the bia as an example we're a
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
relatively small shop we have eight uh
 
00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
relatively small shop we have eight uh
employees

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
but from time
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the exception of one person we're
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
all salaried exempt employees
 
00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:05.669 align:start position:0%
all salaried exempt employees
but

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're occasionally called on to work on
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
what would normally be considered after
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
office hours
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
for those of you who've attended our
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
leadership summit you know that that
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
takes place on a sunday and staff is
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
expected to be there for those of you
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
who've attended our annual dinner that
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
takes place at night staff is expected
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
to be there my employer in order to
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that staff is sacrificing and
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
working at a time that they normally
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be provides compensation time
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
they'll say take take a half day off
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
fill out a slip say it's comp time for
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
the annual dinner and so and
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
employers are trying to find ways to to
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
work with employees to recognize they
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
are giving up on their time when they're
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
any other further questions
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm gina balka ceo of the
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
granite state home health and hospice
 
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
granite state home health and hospice
association

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
our organization advocates for home care
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and hospice agencies and palliative care
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
providers and the people they serve
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to house bill 1053
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would require employers to pay
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
time and a half for workers called into
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
work and not previously scheduled and
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is really untenable for home care
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
and hospice agencies
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
the patient census for home care and
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
hospice agencies changes daily
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
if more patients are discharged from
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals or referred by doctors the
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
census will go up
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
if a patient cared for at home is
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
readmitted to a hospital or dies on
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
hospice the census will decline
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
patient acuity also changes
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
their conditions may worsen and more
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
home visits may be needed
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
another example is when a person who's
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
enrolled in new hampshire's medicaid
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
waiver choices for independence program
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
or cfi
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
becomes eligible for more hours of care
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
the need for personal care services and
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
staff will increase
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
so because of this fluctuation in census
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
and acuity
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
agencies often cannot predict how many
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
workers they will need to schedule in
 
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.549 align:start position:0%
workers they will need to schedule in
advance

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
also if scheduled staff
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
call out patients still need services so
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
other staff will be called in to replace
 
00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:43.110 align:start position:0%
other staff will be called in to replace
them

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
most of our part-time workers are per
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
diem employees who welcome the
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility of choosing the days they
 
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.630 align:start position:0%
flexibility of choosing the days they
work

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
but they also recognize and expect that
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
they may be asked to consider additional
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
shifts on short notice
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
so paying time and a half for
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
unscheduled employees called and torque
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
is not feasible because most home care
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
and hospice agencies depend on
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
government-funded reimbursement programs
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
such as medicare medicaid cfi or va
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the payments to agencies are set for
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
these programs and there is no ability
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
to obtain higher pay payments for higher
 
00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.269 align:start position:0%
to obtain higher pay payments for higher
wages

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
wages
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
and these programs barely cover the cost
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
of care now
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1053 would cost would cause
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
labor costs to increase
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
and many of these agencies would likely
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
stop participating in some of these
 
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
government-funded programs
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
and so patients would go without care
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
i would urge the committee to find house
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill 1053 as an expedient to legislate
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.870 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for the opportunity to
speak

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.669 align:start position:0%
uh
representative

00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%

00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
mandeville mental i'm still learning
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in to testify i
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
just had one quick question you
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony that um
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
employees with which you were familiar
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
select

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
select
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
certain hours and so forth and you added
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
that they understood that they
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
might have to consider that was the word
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
you use
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
extra shifts on short notice
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
in your experience or in your workplace
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
are those circumstances where the
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
employee has the option
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.710 align:start position:0%
employee has the option
to

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
consider and thus either accept or
 
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.470 align:start position:0%
consider and thus either accept or
reject

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
reject
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
the extra shift or is there some
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
different approach generally
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
generally i believe that for especially
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
for per diem staff they're asked to come
 
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
for per diem staff they're asked to come
in

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
in
and

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
they may decline
 
00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
they may decline
um

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think any employer can force an
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
employee to come in to work i guess
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
there could certainly be
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
an employer could say if you don't come
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
into work we're gonna fire you but that
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
is not my understanding of how it works
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
in home care or hospice because most of
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
the employees are per diem now the
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner of labor said it
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
would likely not apply to per diem but i
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
don't see that in the statute
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think that would need to be
 
00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
and so i think that would need to be
clarified

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
see nuns thank you i do have copies of
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman committee members for
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
um i've our organization looked at this
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
bill i represent building and highway
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
contractors in the state
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
we looked at this bill and
 
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.789 align:start position:0%
we looked at this bill and
we

00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
really would want a definition of what
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
an employer's normal scheduling is
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
in construction if you're a plumber
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
you can get called out all the time for
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
different emergencies different days
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
the office if it's a big plumbing firm
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
can maybe doing scheduling the day
 
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.230 align:start position:0%
can maybe doing scheduling the day
before

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.029 align:start position:0%
before
so

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
you might have to go you know be called
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
in on a weekend if some plumbing problem
 
00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
in on a weekend if some plumbing problem
happens

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
then we also have weather issues i
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent highway contractors
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh it's pretty clear in the contracts
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
that you know you don't pave in the rain
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
when it's really pouring or bad weather
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the companies will switch
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
the to working on a saturday or a
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
saturday and a sunday
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a normal procedure so
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
when it says the employers normally
 
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
when it says the employers normally
scheduling

00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
would they be in compliance or not in
 
00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:01.750 align:start position:0%
would they be in compliance or not in
compliance

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
it's also surprised that this bill
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a fiscal note
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
this could be very expensive
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
and not only for private employers but
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire um a few
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
years ago we had a sinkhole on i-93
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t called in contractors to help
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
quickly fix that as that was opening up
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
we had to close the road here in concord
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
d.o.t employees had to be there
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
they worked into the night fixing that
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
repair everybody's proud that how
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
quickly they fixed that problem and
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
keeping the highway open
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
but how would they interpret this bill
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
everybody would be getting time and a
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
half because it wasn't a normal
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is very problematic so our
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
association opposes
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 1053 and i would agree with
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
some of the other previous speakers
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in my office
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been normal scheduling of
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
employees since covid started
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
employers like myself are very flexible
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
the old days of hourly from eight to
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
five o'clock are probably gone
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more flexibility
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
and with covid you have to be flexible
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
in case somebody comes down with
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
something it has to be out
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
you got to make those changes
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
every firm even whether it's a
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
construction firm is dealing with covet
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
and employees calling out this bill
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
would be very problematic to keeping the
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
operation going and so
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
again i would hope this committee would
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
vote itl on house bill 1053.
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr abbott uh questions
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative avalani
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
edward for taking my question
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
in your line of work or your
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
people you represent line of work are
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
you noticing a shortage of products
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
that are causing a lot of rescheduling
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
oh we have we clearly have supply chain
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
issues it's probably one of the top
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
issues that we're discussing with state
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
agencies as far as trying to fulfill the
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
obligations of contracts
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
and getting products and
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
it clearly is an issue for the
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:14.950 align:start position:0%
construction industry
also

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
the previous question
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
was asked about
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
employees and finding employees very
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult in this market
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
contractors are doing everything in
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
their power to keep their employees and
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
and in i i know i represent some
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
companies that will tell me you come to
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
work for us you're gonna start at
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the follow-up
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
so if you had to factor in
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
this time and a half
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
for scheduling changes how would that
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
affect your contracts
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
this this is where the fiscal note comes
 
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
this this is where the fiscal note comes
in

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
we might have a contract with the dot to
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
perform for a certain dollar amount it
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
clearly would affect that if the cost of
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
i got 40 an hour employees working on a
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
project the costs are going to
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically change depending on how
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is interpreted i think right now
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
i would make a plea to the labor
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
department that our normaling scheduled
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
and fluctuates all the time and this
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to us
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
that would be my first answer
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.670 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
huff

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
huff
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
abbott for taking my question
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming um
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong but a lot of
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
the folks that you might deal with are
 
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.230 align:start position:0%
the folks that you might deal with are
union

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh no i would say 90 or open shop about
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
my question really kind of is about
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
union generally speaking my
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is unions
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh will have an agreement and they may
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
have a pay schedule
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
well what if you're at the top of that
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
well i i do have
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
i do uh at one part of my career i did
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the association negotiate union
 
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
for the association negotiate union
agreements

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
and yes
uh

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
between labor and management they
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
negotiate those terms of whether it's
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
vacation days holidays how other days
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
work and time but that's negotiated and
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is where the problem with
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
any of these bills where
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
the employer's relationship with the
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
employees is either defined by a union
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
agreement even in open shop there's
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
usually a clear understanding how
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
flexible a company is with their
 
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.829 align:start position:0%
flexible a company is with their
employees

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't see big issues to require this
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
is i hope that answers your question but
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
this could affect those labor agreements
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any questions
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
hundred members across new hampshire
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that range from both the national major
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
chains to small main street shops and
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
everything in between
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
the associations opposed to this bill
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to give you a couple of
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
very specific retail examples of why
 
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
very specific retail examples of why
um

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
retailers of all sizes just like the
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
industries that you've heard from
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
previously this morning find it very
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to hire to find employees
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's one major chain
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
with one specific location in southern
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that for the holiday
 
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that for the holiday
season

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
season
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
spent the entire holiday season 45
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
positions short of their optimal
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
schedule to make matters worse at some
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
point in the beginning back in the fall
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
they had hired actually hired 30
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
individuals who did not show up for the
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
work presumably found another job and
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
didn't bother to tell anybody
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
at any given time over the last several
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
months they're
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
around 11 people short that are out
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
because they've tested positive for
 
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.829 align:start position:0%
because they've tested positive for
coven

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
coven
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
and this is on top of folks offering
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
incentives including that that
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
particular retailer
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
added uh hourly wage for weekend shifts
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
a 300 bonus for example for finishing
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
out the holiday season
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and still they're finding it extremely
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible to find
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
employees um
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
the coveted situation with the 11
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
employees out on any given day
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
sort of exacerbates the impact of of
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
this bill
because

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
employers are having to scramble at the
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
last minute more than the typical cold
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
and flu season
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
many of the major members have apps for
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
where employees can
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
swap shifts
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
i want to take this day off when i'm
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled to
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
post their shift with somebody else
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
another employee can willingly accept
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
the offer
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
this bill forces the employer then in
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
that case to pay them time and a half
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
when they willingly either at the
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
request of a fellow employee or the
 
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.910 align:start position:0%
request of a fellow employee or the
employer

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
to come into work
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
the other retail specific example i'd
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
like to give you is
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the furniture and appliance sector
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
furniture stores are telling us uh and
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard from constituents
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
or other people that you know
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
um to place an order for a piece of
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
furniture nowadays
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
means a 12-month wait
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
um it's an awful long time
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
the customer puts a deposit down on a
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
piece of furniture at a set price and in
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
it in the interim
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
shipping costs and other costs could
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
increase and have increased
 
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
increase and have increased
significantly

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
the furniture store at that point can't
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
go back to the customer and say geez my
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
costs have increased we're going to pass
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
this on to you it just doesn't work that
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
way the furniture store eats the
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
difference in cost so
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
i can foresee a situation where the
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
truck shows up there's a bunch of
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
furniture unloaded at the store they
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
want to get it delivered to the to the
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
customer as soon as possible and they
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
ask employees to come in and do that
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
this likely this provision would likely
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
put them in the red for that piece of
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
furniture and that's not a business
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
model that's going to be sustained for
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
very long so
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh for all of those reasons uh the
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
retail association opposes this bill and
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
asks you to find an integer to legislate
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm happy to answer questions
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
to the best of my ability
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr any questions
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative avilani
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
being here today for our questions
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the app where employees
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
can switch shifts that have already been
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
previously scheduled
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
upon reading this
 
00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
upon reading this
provision

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
would time and a half apply to those
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
employees who have just switched out of
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
their schedules i believe it would yes
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other further questions
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative mannable
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for your testimony i i
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand the points you've made about
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
covet and uh the
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.349 align:start position:0%
covet and uh the
shift

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh switching issues
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
the other two though i
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
i i struggle with a bit and so
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
my my question to you i guess is twofold
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:46.950 align:start position:0%
as to the
uh

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
the availability of workers which we all
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
are familiar with
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and given the mobility of
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
workers between this state and other
 
00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:58.870 align:start position:0%
workers between this state and other
states

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this kind of a bill and this
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
one in particular
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
be viewed by the retail
 
00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:07.430 align:start position:0%
be viewed by the retail
industry

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
industry
as

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
a means by which to attract workers to
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
come or stay here
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
and part b
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
in respect to the cost issue that you
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the idea of
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
predictability regarding
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
the cost to be incurred for
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
work of this sort be more able to be
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
factored into
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
a pricing mechanism
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
than a haphazard approach
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i apologize my response earlier in
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
my testimony may not have been thorough
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
enough that i was trying to address your
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
earlier question from earlier in the
 
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.790 align:start position:0%
earlier question from earlier in the
hearing

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
retailers are making every effort that
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
they can to provide a financial
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
incentive for people to come and work
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it's just not working so an
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
additional time and a half in this case
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know i think they're already
 
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
you know i think they're already
covering

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
covering
 
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
covering
um

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
in addition i would suggest that
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
whether it be a store owner or store
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
manager in their case knows what's
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
situation

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing what's within their means
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
to attract employees
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
so i think they're already covering that
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
they know what is going to be necessary
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
but understand there's a balancing act
 
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
but understand there's a balancing act
right

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
retailers sell items that are price
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive there's a decision you make
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
between buying item a or item b there's
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
a decision consumers make between buying
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
item a and not buying anything at all so
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's only so much that they can pass
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
on before affecting their sales so i
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
suggest they're already doing what they
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative prout
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
do you know of any prohibition in
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
current law that would make an employer
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't offer as an
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
enticement for employees to come in for
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
work not previously scheduled time and a
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
half for that shift as part of the
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
request to come in thank you for the
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
question no no i don't and in fact i'm
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
aware in at least some industries that's
 
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
aware in at least some industries that's
happening

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
see none thank you mr berry thank you mr
 
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.829 align:start position:0%

that's the last card uh i have is there
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wishes to speak for
 
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.910 align:start position:0%

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll close the hearing on
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
that and i'll turn the gavel back to
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
honorable members for welcoming and
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
welcoming me and to your committee
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
um it's been the first time i've been
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
before you in a long time
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is a bill just a study committee i
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
know that uh there are
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
members who are understandably reticent
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
to do yet another study committee but
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
this has not been studied ever that i
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
could find
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
a study committee to
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
study the effects of high heat and
 
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:50.550 align:start position:0%
study the effects of high heat and
temperature

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
temperature
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
on employee working conditions and this
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
was something that i wanted
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
to look into because of my personal
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
experience with a
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
a whole host of different people i am a
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
a cdl licensed driver i have driven for
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
public transit for five years
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i also
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
have had my entire family has always
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
been basically in the restaurant
 
00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
been basically in the restaurant
industry

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i've had a myriad of family members
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
friends neighbors and
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
bus passengers that i've just heard
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
stories from not because i had solicited
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
any particular stories about heat but
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
just they would come home or be on my
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
bus going home from work and talk about
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
the conditions that they had to work in
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
and honestly
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
over my life hearing these stories it's
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
horrifying it's something that you would
 
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.710 align:start position:0%
horrifying it's something that you would
imagine

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would exist in another country or
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the you know maybe a hundred years
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
ago in a factory
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
stories of cooks that have to work over
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
open flames with no real ventilation in
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
the kitchen no air conditioning in their
 
00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
the kitchen no air conditioning in their
kitchens

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
kitchens
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
stories of people who have to do
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
do wood construction in these shops that
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
have no reasonable
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
air conditioning or proper ventilation
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
and from what i can under from what i
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
could dig up it's not something that
 
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.630 align:start position:0%
could dig up it's not something that
osha

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
osha
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
has done a
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
thorough job of of covering
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
so i would just like to see in an
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's a lot of
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
factors here in terms of what would be
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
expected in a particular industry in
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
terms of what exact temperatures had an
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
effect at what humidity levels what kind
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
of airflow you would need for
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
for someone to remain healthy and being
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
able to actively do their job over hours
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
what kind of access to water they might
 
00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:43.670 align:start position:0%
what kind of access to water they might
need

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
that this is something that just needs
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
more study than than i certainly can put
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
in as an individual it needs more
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
expertise than i have
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm i am uh
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
quite adamant and happy to talk at
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
length about the literal dozens dozens
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
of people that i've heard talk about
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
high heat working conditions over the
 
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
high heat working conditions over the
years

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
just want to know if we can study what
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
we can possibly do about this and i'm i
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that is
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
worth the study worth looking into and
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's really my testimony and
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
prove senator sullivan
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
um

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's um and mr chairman if i'm out of
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
order you'll be quick to tell me
 
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.270 align:start position:0%
order you'll be quick to tell me
but

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
there is bill hb 1304
 
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.230 align:start position:0%
there is bill hb 1304
which

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
is intended to
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
study the impact of outdoor working
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
conditions in heat and cold
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as what you're talking
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
about but it's awfully similar
 
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:01.829 align:start position:0%
about but it's awfully similar
um

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd just like to hear how you
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
think i mean
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
establishing two study committees would
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think be foolish
 
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.870 align:start position:0%
i think be foolish
um

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
how could you see
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs of both of these bills
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question obviously
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
when i submitted this idea to
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
ols and with the understanding that
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
typically the lawyers will notify you if
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
you're working on similar legislation as
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
another member but i was not notified so
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that this other bill
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
was going in i'm very happy for these
 
00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:36.870 align:start position:0%
was going in i'm very happy for these
two

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
study committees to be rolled into one
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.390 align:start position:0%
study committees to be rolled into one
and

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think the wording would have to do
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
something about studying the effects of
 
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.349 align:start position:0%
something about studying the effects of
both

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
high and low temperatures regardless of
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to call you out of order
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
for the
representative

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
testimony it's the easiest yet i'll be
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
here all day so
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have uh ten more minutes folks
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
before your um
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
for our next
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
hearing just a few announcements if you
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
have not heard
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
the speaker has requested that we move
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
up by one week when we get
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
our bills in second committee our
 
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.430 align:start position:0%
our bills in second committee our
financial

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
bills we only have two of them
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled both of them we've already
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
heard one of them
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we were getting the second one i
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
believe next time we meet we'll be
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
discussing it so we will have to execute
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
those and have them
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
out of our committee by february 10th
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
intends to have a
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
house session
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
so we don't know where or what day of
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
the week
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
but at this point
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
it is my goal to have all of our bills
 
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.950 align:start position:0%
it is my goal to have all of our bills
heard

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
by february 10th
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
session on
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be here in person as best you can
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
if you cannot find a replacement for
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
yourself because we will be executing
 
00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
yourself because we will be executing
bills

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
each of the next uh
 
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.950 align:start position:0%
each of the next uh
two

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
labor committee sessions
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
i try to do them in groups
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
we all have different personalities in
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
how we run committees but boy you guys
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
lucky you're on that committee
 
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
lucky you're on that committee
um

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
this someone was asked to want to just
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
tell me as a presenting representative
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
that there was a typo and the chairman
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
requested that they
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
forming the phrase of a parliamentary
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
procedure or something it was just as
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
simple as typo on you know line three
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
um and then they were executing bills 15
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
minutes after they heard them which kind
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
of as a rule i don't think we should do
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's up to any chairman how they want to
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
do it so i'd like to give you as much
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
time in advance to let you know what
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
bills are coming up and which ones are
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
going to be exact if you look in your
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
calendar which should come out tomorrow
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see that heather and i were very
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
busy the last 24 hours trying to put all
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
these together let everyone know
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
what is going to be exact and when
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
i don't like pulling stuff out
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
i don't like pulling stuff out the last
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
minute you can have everyone has an
 
00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.390 align:start position:0%
minute you can have everyone has an
opportunity

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know just to say their piece there's
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
no gotcha stuff going on um
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
so any other questions of the chair at
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be the most consistent
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
one of us needs to fly the friendly
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
skies so we're going to try to do some
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
things earlier in the day and other
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
people have obviously a number of you
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
have emailed me that you have interim
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
conflicts that you have to go
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
to a hearing present your bill speak on
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
behalf just like i did this morning
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's all fine and good i will try to
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
accommodate as much as possible if
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
someone here has a bill
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they cannot be there for a certain
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
day if there's an exec on that bill i
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
will not do that that day
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
unless i'm going to find a crunch with
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
time with the two
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
second committee bills which
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
is not going to happen
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
so just let me know i believe someone
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
this someone else has let me know
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
when they're not going to be around so
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
people have been pretty good about
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
letting me know
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
but it's very important i respect the
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
fact that some people don't want to come
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
into the committee room
 
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.870 align:start position:0%
into the committee room
um

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
but if you cannot on the 27th or the
 
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
but if you cannot on the 27th or the
third

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
please tell your party leader that you
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
at least 24 hours in advance so we can
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
get someone here
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
because i don't want anyone to say well
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't get to vote we didn't know
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
there was going to be executive sessions
 
00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:24.150 align:start position:0%

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:28.549 align:start position:0%

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
um and at that time so this is just to
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
explain it this would be prohibiting the
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
use of a credit history check
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
in employment decisions for
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
most jobs um at that time it was almost
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
entire uh prohibition and there was a
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the banking industry
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
that approached me and said we would be
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
fine with this if you exempted certain
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
types of positions that are kind of
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
fiscally sensitive
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was a perfectly
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:49.109 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was a perfectly
reasonable

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
compromise so this contains that
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
compromise um i am aware that there is a
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for
 
01:02:58.559 --> 01:02:59.349 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for
uh

01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
representing a number of employer
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
clients that is here in opposition i did
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
just speak with him and i believe we can
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
work on clarifying language specifically
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh his concern primarily was that a
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
concern that this might not include
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
employees of contractors
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i am happy to work on an amendment to
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
clarify that that
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
provided those contractors those
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
positions where those contractor
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
employees would be
 
01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:28.549 align:start position:0%
employees would be
um

01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
be used are sensitive positions that
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
they also be allowed to credit check
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
those employees
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but having said that
 
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
um but having said that
uh

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.190 align:start position:0%
uh
i

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
the reason this is necessary and i
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
realized we're currently in a labor
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
shortage and i was in the committee
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
office right here and overheard someone
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
say currently people are hiring anybody
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
who can i think pass a literacy test and
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
fog a mirror or something something to
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
that effect i understand that you know
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
right now uh this might not be a huge
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
concern for your everyday uh
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
employers and employees but it will
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
certainly be a concern again and the
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
issue is that we believe that we have um
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
a system
 
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
a system
where

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
if you just
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
hunker down and work hard and save up
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
money you can get there
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
right we believe in that system that
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
kind of meritocracy
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
good hard work is is rewarded but the
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
problem with our current system if
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
happened to get into a situation where
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't have enough money to cover
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
their bills now they're stuck they're in
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
a catch-22 they can't get a job to pay
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
those bills
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
but you're
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
not allowing them to have a job in order
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
to pay those bills so they're stuck and
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
that isn't consistent with our ideals it
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
isn't consistent with our belief that
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
just enough hard work and hunkering down
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
um will will get someone where someone
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
where they need to go and i kind of want
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
to push back i think there's a bit of a
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
stigma when it comes to um
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
people that we call poor actually this
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
is a sociology term the unworthy poor
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
this stigma that
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
people with in this case bad credit
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
history um that they're just no good
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
they're just irresponsible lazy no good
 
01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
they're just irresponsible lazy no good
people

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the truth of the matter is when you
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
actually look at individuals we're
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
talking about people who went through
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
divorce who had health concerns
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
who are going through perhaps a bad
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
economy right now
 
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
economy right now
who

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
have had any number of issues happen to
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
them in their lives are there
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
irresponsible people in the world
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely but there's a whole bunch of
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
people through no moral feeling of
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
theirs who just happen to hit rough
 
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
theirs who just happen to hit rough
times

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
times
and

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to those people is
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
cutting them out cutting their legs out
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
from under them and not enabling them to
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
work their way back up into a good
 
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
work their way back up into a good
position

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
so again i'm happy to add any kind of
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
clarifying language to make sure any and
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
all sensitive positions are allowed to
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
credit check those employees
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
but um you know
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
i was security guard contracted
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
employees was brought up i'm happy to
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
work with that but i think for most
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
positions what we need to do is make
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
sure people are able give them a ladder
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
so that they can climb back up with that
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for any
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
you mr chair right thank you
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
i've been on this committee for a while
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i've seen this bill a few times
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm always disappointed that it
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
because i think it's i think it is
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
limit someone's possibilities because of
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
some prior error that may not have been
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
an error at all maybe circumstances as
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned medical bills
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
a divorce who you know maybe your spouse
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
has run up your credit and you have no
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
control over that and i've also learned
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
that there are many times the credit
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
reporting agencies have errors
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you could be i think i heard from a
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
previous sponsor of the bill that uh he
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
was in
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the lob testifying
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
and yet someone said he bought a tractor
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
do you uh do you feel as though
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
i see you've got most of the exceptions
 
01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
i see you've got most of the exceptions
covered

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
is the is there is there a
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
reason why i mean like have you heard of
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
examples where someone has passed a
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
credit check and you had somehow
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
embezzled i've seen town managers that
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
have embezzled is it a credit history
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
passing a credit history not again is it
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
not is it it isn't a guarantee that
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
something won't happen you won't have
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
gambling debts from uh
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
some other circumstance or some other
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
thing that happened that lead you to
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
pill for something from the drawer
 
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
pill for something from the drawer
uh

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.270 align:start position:0%
uh
right

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
is that is that all
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question my
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
honorable co-representative newmarket um
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
so right there is no guarantee in life
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
you are absolutely correct and certainly
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
people who happen to have a lot of money
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
and we can name any number of like news
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
stories on this issue who have a lot of
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
money and have a lot of great credit
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
um have been caught doing some really
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
awful things including financial things
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
or especially perhaps financial things
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times that's how they
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
got that money to begin with um but
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh you're right that there is no
 
01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
uh you're right that there is no
guarantee

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
but again i i have put in those
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
exemptions and you know i also wanted to
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
point out yes i pointed out that people
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
may have ended up in bad credit because
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
of divorce or health crises or what have
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
you any even just a bad economy right
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
because if if we believe that people
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
with bad credit are simply you know no
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
good irresponsible people then why is it
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the worse the economy gets all of a
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
sudden there's more immoral people that
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
have bad credit no it's something that
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
impacts everybody regardless of their
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
morality or worthwhileness but also
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
young people right young people that's
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
an example of no credit
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
but how if they have if you credit check
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
all these positions
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's a real barrier to building up
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
good credit as a young person
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i understand that
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps an employer would make an
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
argument of well i would like to see
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
this person's moral character i want to
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
know that i'm hiring a responsible good
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
person but the point is is that this is
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
not reflective necessarily of their
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility and unless you're hiring
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
them for a sensitive position
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's really not nothing none of your
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
concern and you have to enable those
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
people to work their way up and out of
 
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
people to work their way up and out of
debt

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question
 
01:09:57.199 --> 01:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question
representative

01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
so

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
where my head is at is that the process
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
of performing a credit check for the
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
employer is not free and i don't can't
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
see them
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
performing it for no reason so what can
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you give me some examples of positions
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
that people are running credit checks
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
that don't fall into one of your
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
exemptions that you're what you're
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
trying to stop because i can't see you
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
know someone running a credit check for
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
a landscaping job or or something you
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
know there's no reason behind why the
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
employer wants the credit check i
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
just off the top of my head recently
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
heard of someone who was denied a job as
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
a sales job at a harley-davidson because
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
um was part of that job negotiating the
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
final price i mean it almost seems like
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
that would uh
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
fit under the exemption of roman numeral
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
fit under the exemption of roman numeral
iii

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
iii
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is which in which
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
case it shouldn't be a problem passing
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
this right but um but my understanding
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
is that while they had negotiation
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
skills they're limited to a certain
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
range in which there's a bottom line
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they can't go beneath so there's
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
that limitation and yes they were able
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
to negotiate the price but they didn't
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
weren't responsible for like taking the
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
person's money that was all done
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
um by the structure in the organization
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
so not not the person in charge of
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually doing the the money work
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you and apologies to the
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
i see a a a small area here that i'm not
 
01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
i see a a a small area here that i'm not
quite

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
sold on
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
and what that is is
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
this law
appears

01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
appears
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
to be telling an employer what they may
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
or may not be able to consider in hiring
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
now my question is is how are you going
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
to enforce that it's almost like
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to use this term
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
in the broad sense but it's almost like
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
thought police
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying to a an employer
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
do your due diligence to get the
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
employee that you want but don't think
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
so how would you enforce that so it's
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
not thought police it's not don't think
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
it says shall use or request information
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the credit history so they can think
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they want but they can't
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay stop follow-up i mean i mean to
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
further answer that question for example
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
we are in a um
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
a state where employers can
 
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.070 align:start position:0%
a state where employers can
largely

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
largely
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
employ or fire whoever they want so
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
technically if you come in and they
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't know your credit report but you
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
just for whatever reason you're dressed
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
you're hygiene you just look like you're
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
not a responsible person they cannot
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
hire you based on that obviously
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
right so it's not thought police is my
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
point uh no i'm i'm good
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
for representative cahill any other
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
first time around questions
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative cahill you recognized
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sharon a very brief one
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't the question of
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
credit history doesn't that sort of go
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
disdain for interfering in people's
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
privacy their financial
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
records and
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
who knows what else they would learn if
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh studying your credit history thank
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
you so much for the question that is a
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
point that i failed to mention in my
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and had thought to mention
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
originally that there is a certain
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
expected level of privacy for example if
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
my bedroom habits are you know
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
considered private and they and those
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
habits don't impact
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
a potential job that i might be filling
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
it would we would all consider extremely
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
invasive for an employer to somehow get
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
an official record of what i might be
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
interested in the bedroom right so that
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be entirely invasive of my privacy
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
and have nothing to do with the job
 
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.310 align:start position:0%
and have nothing to do with the job
so

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
likewise they your potential employer
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
could find out any number of whatever
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
habits or interests or whatever you
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
might have by looking at a credit report
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
so yes it's invasive if it has the point
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
is it have if it has nothing to do with
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
the job that you're being hired for then
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
it should be none of their business and
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be considered because you
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
have a right to build yourself up and
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
save up money work hard and get out of
 
01:14:48.159 --> 01:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
save up money work hard and get out of
debt

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the
 
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the
presenter

01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
presenter
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
before i call
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
bruce berkey
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
to tell us why they have to add the
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear regulatory people i'm going to
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
call rudy ogden from the department of
 
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:22.630 align:start position:0%
call rudy ogden from the department of
labor

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record rudy
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
ogden deputy commissioner department of
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
labor um just in reviewing this
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation the one question we have as
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier uh bills or bills
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
like this have come up several times so
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
in a generalized sense we're aware of
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
the intent and what uh is being looked
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
for but relative to lines 14 and 15 um
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
the department would just seek
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
additional guidance or clarification the
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
exception that says an employer has a
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
bona fide purpose for requesting or
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
using information
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
i believe the intent may be to be
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly broad with that language but
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would just point out that from an
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
administration or an ongoing
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
administration standpoint we would just
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
be looking for
 
01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:02.310 align:start position:0%
be looking for
um

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
if an employer runs a credit check and
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
they say well i believe that is a
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
indication of responsibility
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
would it be the department then saying
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
no that's not a valid reason that's not
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
a bona fide reason
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
again i think i just put it out there as
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
something where if this was passed we
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
would just want to be clear that we see
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
that as being very broad so it might be
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial to uh tailor that a little
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
bit or more narrow it so that for
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of actual intent
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
that could be met happy to take any
 
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
that could be met happy to take any
questions

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr agnes nice to see you again
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot in the telephone but
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see you after probably over
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative avaloni
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
commissioner

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
14 or 15 were questioned as well but
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
most employers
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
need a release from the employee or
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
potential employee to have their credit
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
check have a background check to have
 
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
check have a background check to have
anything

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
checked um so they would be
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
aware that their credit
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
could be a deciding factor in their job
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
if they're complying with uh what they
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
should be then yes there should be some
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement or notice that the
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
credit check is going to happen
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
jeffy ogden
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
the question was asked earlier about
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement would this be handled in the
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
way of other claims that
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
a person who
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
applied for a position and came to the
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
asked to ask to sign the release
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
credit check after this had passed
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
would that be a violation or something
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
that would be brought to the
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
department's attention
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
for correction
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative cahill thank you for the
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
question yes this is uh from the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
intended legislation being placed in rsa
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
275 protective legislation uh it would
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
be subject to our other enforcement
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
actions namely if there was a violation
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
of this or suggestion of a violation of
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
this we would look into whether or not
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
it happened or more likely than not
 
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.750 align:start position:0%
it happened or more likely than not
happened

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
there would be the probably an initial
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
warning because the warning statute
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
would call for a warning to the employer
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
of our suggestion that there's a
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
violation here if it's not corrected
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
there could be fines
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
resultant from the action or inaction
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%

they own approximately 89
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the facility
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we are here today
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 1385.
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
i am the unnamed lobbyist that
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative reed spoke with we had a
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
nice conversation about uh some of our
 
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.790 align:start position:0%
nice conversation about uh some of our
concerns

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
um there are two
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
um concerns that are
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
bright um
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
and there perhaps are others
 
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.390 align:start position:0%
and there perhaps are others
uh

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
at the facility there is a a security
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
force that works um to
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
keep that facility
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh tight and safe and secure
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
contractors they are not employees of
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
nextera energy
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
next their energy contracts with a
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
company to provide that service
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
with the responsibility that next server
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
energy has in overseeing the facility
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
there would be a need for
 
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.350 align:start position:0%
there would be a need for
the

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
for them to have access to
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
credit reports for
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
the employees of that contractor
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
the second example
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
is that every 18 months seawork station
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
goes uh shuts down and goes through
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
about a 30-day refueling process
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
rods that
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
create the energy at the at the plant
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of 500 additional
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
employees there are generally about 600
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
employees at the station
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
year round
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
but during the refueling process there
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
are an additional 500 or so
 
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.910 align:start position:0%
are an additional 500 or so
employees

01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
and they're not employees of next-door
 
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.430 align:start position:0%
and they're not employees of next-door
energy

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
they are employees of contractors who
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
come on site
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
who have specialties
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
these people are from all across the
 
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.390 align:start position:0%
these people are from all across the
country

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're not just new hampshire
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
they they they go from
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
a nuclear power plant to nuclear power
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
plant to nuclear power plant all across
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
the country performing these services
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it's it's been a boon for the uh
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
rental real estate market um in in the
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
seacoast because of the
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh the time of year that they come in
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
they come in generally around april or
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
in the october november time frame when
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
those rental car cottages are
 
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
those rental car cottages are
empty

01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
empty
 
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
empty
so

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
those employees those contractors
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
employees of those contractors
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
also need to
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
have their credit
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
reports available to nextera energy
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
because the ultimate responsibility for
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
that site is next to our energy
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
so uh representative reed and i spoke
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
and about the possibility of developing
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
some language
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
um i'd be happy to work with her or with
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
the committee or both
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr burke any questions
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you mr
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
berkey for your testimony
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
you brought up something that over the
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
years i haven't heard discussed before
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll ask you for your thoughts in a
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
more general sense even though you're
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a very specific
 
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.629 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a very specific
industry

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
industry
so

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
someone works primarily in another state
 
01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.629 align:start position:0%
someone works primarily in another state
and

01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
that state doesn't have these
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitions so they have had and this
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
is very broadly it's is related to
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
hiring but also termination promotion
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
demotion discipline compensation
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's in its credit checks
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
in anything to do with employment
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
so a person works in another state where
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is done as a matter of course now
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
they come and are involved in a project
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire where they have some
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
nexus with a new hampshire employer
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
from what you said it would seem like
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
this could create a
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
an instant problem
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
because the law didn't apply until the
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
moment it suddenly does
 
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
moment it suddenly does
any

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
any
thoughts

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
on that in the more general sense
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and and one that
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
i have not sort of mapped out as to how
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
it would be addressed but
 
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
it would be addressed but
um

01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
certainly nexter energy would
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know if they have access to that
 
01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
you know if they have access to that
information

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh can go to the employer of that
 
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
uh can go to the employer of that
contractor

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
or to that business that is the
 
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
or to that business that is the
contractor

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
to you know air concerns
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
but it would create a very confusing
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
process because of the
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
interstate nature of the
 
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
interstate nature of the
activity

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:41.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
berkey

01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
berkey
 
01:24:41.679 --> 01:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
berkey
um

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
so am i correct in that the federal
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
regulations that you know
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
cover nuclear facilities don't refer to
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
contract workers
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding
 
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding
thank

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
you representative mandeville
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you uh mr berkey for your
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony i um
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
um i understand you're concerned about
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
contractors and you've said you'd be
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
willing to talk to
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
the bill's proponent about that
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you may have heard deputy ogden's
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh point about um
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh sub paragraph four and the bona fide
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
purpose i wonder if your client
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
would feel that some of its concerns
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be addressed if there were some
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
sort of proactive opportunity set forth
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
prospectively a bona fide purpose to be
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
identified and approved by the labor
 
01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:41.189 align:start position:0%
identified and approved by the labor
department

01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mandeville
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
a good question um
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would agree with deputy commissioner
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
ogden that the
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
in some instances we might like it to be
 
01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
in some instances we might like it to be
broad

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
broad
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
um but
certainly

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know any language in any law that
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
does not have four crisp corners
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
brings in the lawyers and and i'm sure
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's a concern of the departments and
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be a concern of
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
next-door energies
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
so i would um
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know i would endeavor
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
myself representative reid this
 
01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:24.709 align:start position:0%
myself representative reid this
committee

01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:24.719 --> 01:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
committee
to

01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
try and crisp that up a little bit yes
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you very much thank you

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
on 12 51.
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
do we still have the
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.239 --> 01:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
270

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:44.830 align:start position:0%
270
279

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
the reason i bring this up if you have
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
looked at the next bill in front of us
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
it references
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 279 20 colon 22 and 279 colon 21.
 
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
rsa 279 20 colon 22 and 279 colon 21.
um

01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure i have it out for
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
everyone in case they have any questions
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
related to what that means
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh 279 22
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
colon 22a because that's to do with high
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
school students and um
 
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.030 align:start position:0%
school students and um
and

01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for
 
01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:26.629 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for

01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:26.639 --> 01:29:01.350 align:start position:0%
that
so

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%

here and thank you for your service and
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
attention today house bill 1251 is a
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
simple bill designed to allow new
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire's tipped wage workers
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
and disabled workers access to nothing
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
more than minimum wage which is 7.25
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire sub minimum wage
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
reserved for tipped workers
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
is now frozen at 3.37
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
until last year subminimum wage was
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
coupled with the minimum wage at 45
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
percent of minimum wage
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
we know that new hampshire defaults to
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage of 7.25 cents
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
per hour
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bill passed last year eliminated
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
this coupling
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
and freezes sub-minimum wages for tipped
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
employees at three dollars and 27 cents
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
per hour
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
even if the federal minimum wage rises
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
under current law any restaurant hotel
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
motel inn cabin or ballroom employee who
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
receives more than 30 a month in tips
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
may be paid by their employer at 45
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the current 7.25 an hour
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
which amounts to 327 and again that's
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
now frozen
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire workers are again at a
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
disadvantage when compared to wages in
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for tipped workers in our
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are massachusetts at
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
six dollars and fifteen cents per hour
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
maine is six dollars and 38 cents per
 
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
maine is six dollars and 38 cents per
hour

01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
and vermont is six dollars and 28 cents
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
you may not think of tipping as a legacy
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
of slavery but it has far more
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
racialized history than most americans
 
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.950 align:start position:0%
racialized history than most americans
realize

01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
realize
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
tipping originated in feudal europe and
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
was imported to the united states by
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
american travelers eager to seem
 
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
american travelers eager to seem
sophisticated

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%

country
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and after the civil war as u.s employers
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
largely in the hospitality sector looked
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
for ways to avoid paying formerly
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
enslaved workers
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
one of the most notorious examples comes
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
from the pullman company which hired
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
newly freed african-american men as
 
01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
newly freed african-american men as
porters

01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
porters
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
rather than paying them a real wage
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
pullman provided the porters with just a
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
meager pittance forcing them to rely on
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
tips from their white clientele for most
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
of their pay
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
tipping further entrenched a unique and
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
often racialized class structure in
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
service jobs in which workers must
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
please both customer and employer to
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
wage to workers who were
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
who then were forced to rely on tips was
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged at the time
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
in his popular 1916 anti-tipping study
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
the itching palm writer william scott
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
described tipping
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
as an aristocratic custom that went
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
against american ideals
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
the relation of a man giving a tip and a
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
man accepting it is as undemocratic as
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
the relation of master and slave scott

a citizen in a republic ought to stand
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
shoulder to shoulder with every other
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
citizen with no thought of cringing
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
without an assumption of superiority
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
or an acknowledgment of inferiority
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
when the department of labor conducted
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
an unusual sweep
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
of 9 000 full-service restaurants
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
between 2010
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
and 2012
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
they found that 84 percent had violated
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
the sub-minimum wage system
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
in order to chase after those lost wages
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
workers have to file complaints with the
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
that takes time and money and that is
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
something a tipped worker who has
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
missing wages
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
already doesn't have
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
there are states that have eliminated
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage altogether
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
like oregon and washington
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
and my colleague representative schultz
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to you more about
 
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to you more about
that

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i urge the committee to
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
right the wrong done to our tipped and
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
disabled workers and recommend that
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1251 ought to pass
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i've provided you um
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
some research data
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
and uh which you are i'm not going to go
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
through it because we're all you know
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
you are all able to read it and
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
you can do that at a time that's most
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
convenient for you but there's some
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
information there and the references to
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
where it came from are printed on the
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
sides of the pages
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the presenter representative
 
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.590 align:start position:0%
for the presenter representative
seaworth

01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing your bill
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
several times during your testimony you
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned disabled workers and i'm
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the language of your bill
 
01:41:04.239 --> 01:41:05.270 align:start position:0%
looking at the language of your bill
here

01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
it seems that the
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability is already
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited in current language
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
and by striking that you're not
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
changing anything relative to disabled
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
workers am i misinterpreting the bill
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
you you have not
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
all right now you got me confused
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually and well
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative schultz is going to speak
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
more to that representative seaworth we
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
this committee did pass a law correct
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
which we can no longer provide a
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
lower than minimum wage for disability
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
so what was your question about why that
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
was crossed out
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
what i was questioning i i recall
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
working on that legislation too
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
i was questioning the statement and the
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that this would
 
01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.870 align:start position:0%
testimony that this would
provide

01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
additional wages to disabled workers
 
01:42:01.119 --> 01:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
additional wages to disabled workers
which

01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
i understood not to be the case and i
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure i wasn't
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the intent of this
 
01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.709 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the intent of this
language

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative chris schultz
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
who recognized to speak
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and committee
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
and i hope you'll stay here too so as i
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a representative from concord i'm
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
working on wage issues i most recently
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
worked for the one fair wage campaign
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
where representative alt shiller and i
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
also were working on well actually the
 
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.149 align:start position:0%
also were working on well actually the
federal

01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
only the federal raise the wage act
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
which does include a provision about
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities but 10 states new hampshire
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
being the first did probably with the
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
work here
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
of many of you uh did get rid of that
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
sub minimum wage for workers with
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities so sorry for that confusion
 
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.270 align:start position:0%
disabilities so sorry for that confusion
but

01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
on the federal work that we were doing
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
that is not the case federally
 
01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.310 align:start position:0%
that is not the case federally
um

01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
so i no longer work for one fair wage
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
but i didn't want it to seem like
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
there was an impropriety to my
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this which is
 
01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.790 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this which is
why

01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller is a sponsor
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i have since been laid off by said
 
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.709 align:start position:0%
and i have since been laid off by said
organization

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
which is fine um
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
because i we have been
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
eager to see wage justice for some time
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
and as she mentioned uh there are seven
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
states in the country that we can look
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
to to say how does this work how does
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
this impact the marketplace how does
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
this impact
 
01:43:49.119 --> 01:43:50.470 align:start position:0%
this impact
competition

01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
how does this impact the back of the
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
house at a restaurant
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the front of the house which
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
i know has been a concern for some
 
01:43:57.119 --> 01:43:58.149 align:start position:0%
i know has been a concern for some
workers

01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
but in those states
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants have thrived profits have
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
we know this because
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
folks have brought it up on their
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
investor calls for companies like darden
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
soon after california eliminated the
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
subminimum wage category
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
for workers wages uh darden said i'm
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
surprised the ceo of darden to the to
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
the shareholders uh that he was
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
surprised that actually
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
the restaurants in the states where
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
there where the sub minimum wage had
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
been eliminated we're doing better
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
and that is in part because you know
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's sort of that old uh henry ford
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
saying you know you want to pay workers
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
well enough so they could buy the cars
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
well you want to pay your workers well
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
enough so they can eat at your
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant i mean that is a piece of it
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire of course
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is a significant portion of our
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
workplace we are a tourist state
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh have also the highest percentage of
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
women in tipped wage jobs
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere around 75 78 percent
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
nationally that average is in the 60s
 
01:45:12.719 --> 01:45:13.990 align:start position:0%
nationally that average is in the 60s
so

01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
predominant business here that is
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
predominantly filled by women
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a concern and
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
we have information about the families
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
on one piece of this and i can provide
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
more on this and the regular minimum
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
wage but it does disproportionately hurt
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
families mothers with children
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so much so as we discussed with the
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
regular minimum wage
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
and it's still to me i think should be a
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan concern
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
that workers who earn so low that they
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
have to go on public assistance which
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
means we the taxpayers we the property
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or however you pay your taxes
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
subsidize the wages of those companies
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i think for maybe different reasons
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
for the same reason that doesn't seem
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
right you know that any worker that's
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
working full-time in new hampshire one
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the wealthiest states the wealthiest
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
country on earth
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
that just
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me so i'm
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
hoping this bill and the tabled minimum
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
wage bill we can perhaps find some
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
common ground
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
on that piece i don't want to
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
i definitely want to acknowledge that
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
because i think there is some room for
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
some bipartisan action
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
that would actually
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
increa increase
 
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
the income of all
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
granite staters overall and increase the
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
wealth in general and all the other
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
great things that happen when you
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
prosper as a state
 
01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.350 align:start position:0%
prosper as a state
um

01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay you mentioned that
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
i also want to say there was a rumor
 
01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.510 align:start position:0%
i also want to say there was a rumor
because

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
because
the

01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lodging and restaurant
 
01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lodging and restaurant
association

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
is a formidable organization um i
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually know the folks
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
that uh are involved with that
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
organization and the restaurant owner
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's prominent
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
i have a good relationship with him
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
we've worked together on some
 
01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.990 align:start position:0%
we've worked together on some
immigration

01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.149 align:start position:0%
immigration
[Music]

01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
laws uh gosh 12 years ago at this point
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that they say is
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
that servers don't want this
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
their tips will go down
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
that actually is not the case
 
01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
that actually is not the case
um

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh their wages will go up
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's important to understand
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
you will also hear that servers don't
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
want this and we have done a survey that
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
i can provide to you and i don't know i
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't remember if it's
 
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
quoted on here but um
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
the raise the wage coalition which is
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
mostly all volunteer has done
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
a survey
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the workers in this industry and in
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
fact the over industry
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
would like a raise
 
01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
would like a raise
um

01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i think it's compelling when you see
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
the signs
 
01:48:02.159 --> 01:48:03.430 align:start position:0%
the signs
that

01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
many workers are needed in a number of
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
jobs the dunkin donuts near me which is
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
across the street from the walmart on
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
loudoun road that's my district
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
their signs recruiting workers
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
says starting wage fifteen dollars with
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
tips on top
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
i think if it's good enough for dunkin
 
01:48:22.719 --> 01:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
i think if it's good enough for dunkin
donuts

01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
donuts
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
it should be good enough for our entire
 
01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.709 align:start position:0%
it should be good enough for our entire
workforce

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
it levels the playing field um
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other things i could
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
say about this and i'm happy to provide
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
more information as we can and
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman of labor and thank
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%

for hearing
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
our testimony today for the record i'm
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative nicole klein knight of
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
manchester district
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
11 for hillsboro county
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
i come before you today
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
not just as a sponsor but as a
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
service industry worker
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
as you know the long hours of the
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
the weird schedule that we promote from
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
a week to week basis
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
is hard on a young person to get a
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
normal full-time job
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
so sometimes to make ends meet i will
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
work in restaurants in the industry
 
01:50:06.639 --> 01:50:07.510 align:start position:0%
work in restaurants in the industry
and

01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
i have to say relying on other people
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
for baseline income
 
01:50:12.719 --> 01:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
for baseline income
is

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't get tipped
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
and it's slow because of covid
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
you make three dollars for a whole hour
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm expected to
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
serve well 325
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm expected to serve and live and fight
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the people of the state along with
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
that also work in this industry
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
how do you expect us to pay our rent and
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
pay for food and pay for gas
 
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.390 align:start position:0%
pay for food and pay for gas
on

01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.270 align:start position:0%
on
such

01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:56.229 align:start position:0%
such
mere

01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
mere
 
01:50:56.239 --> 01:50:58.310 align:start position:0%
mere
scrappings

01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
scrappings
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
there's been times where the business
 
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.430 align:start position:0%
there's been times where the business
owner

01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
their

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
stuff together to put it in a nice term
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
stock their shelves they don't go out
 
01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.470 align:start position:0%
stock their shelves they don't go out
before

01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
opening and they don't
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
get supplies needed so they're
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
constantly out of something if you were
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
a customer to order something and it's
 
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
a customer to order something and it's
out

01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
who do you take that out on
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
you take it out on the server if your
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
food's late who do you take that out on
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
the cook or the server
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's things that are out of our
 
01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
there's things that are out of our
control

01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
but yet as the face of the industry
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
we suffer the brunt of
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
the consequences
 
01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
the consequences
now

01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem fair to me
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
so at least a bare minimum this would
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
provide a fighting chance for
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
people like me and
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
i represent
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
a small population but
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
a large population of service industry
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
workers who have really suffered during
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the least we could do if they're
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
relying on tips to survive and there's
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
nobody coming into a restaurant or the
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner is failing them to
 
01:52:17.679 --> 01:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner is failing them to
provide

01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
a well-run business
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
these people suffer
 
01:52:23.679 --> 01:52:25.589 align:start position:0%
these people suffer
they

01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
they can't feed their kids
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
they run the risk of
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness and it
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
it goes on and on
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
so for that for all those reasons of
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
relying on other people
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
to pay your living wage
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
i urge you to please consider this is a
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
small ask to meet the federal minimum
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
standard of ought to pass thank you so
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
much for your time
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are you going
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%

oh yes this is well she actually um
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
spoke she signed up to speak to testify
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i just didn't know if she all right
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
we'll ask
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
we'll see if we have any questions here
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the members of you and then
 
01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
libby is that her name okay they will
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%

01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative knight
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
in your testimony if i understood it you
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
implied that you have
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
on at least one occasion been paid
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
including tips less than the minimum
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
wage which is illegal under both federal
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
and state law is
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
was that the case and if so did you take
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
any action under the current law to
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
rectify that situation
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative i i'm concerned uh that
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
do you not know what the sub minimum
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
i am well informed about the law in this
 
01:54:04.719 --> 01:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
i am well informed about the law in this
state

01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay but it's under seven dollars
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i believe the minimum wage for tipped
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
cents federal
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's 325.
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
and what i'm referring to if i may
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is that
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
both federal and state law requires that
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
all employees including tipped employees
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
be paid the federal minimum
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
an employer may take as credit against
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
that minimum any tipped wage
 
01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:46.070 align:start position:0%
that minimum any tipped wage
above

01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
and there are two different levels
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's the lower level for federal and
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
a higher level for state
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
but at no time may the total wage be
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
less than the
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for all employees
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what i was referring to
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
the testimony seem to be saying there
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
are employees who who don't honor that
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
who pay less than
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
the absolute minimum wage
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
even when
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
adding in the tipped amounts
 
01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.629 align:start position:0%
adding in the tipped amounts
and

01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
if that if that is this representative's
 
01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.870 align:start position:0%
if that if that is this representative's
experience

01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
she took further action
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
considering it was a violation of the
 
01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
considering it was a violation of the
law

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question actually um
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
there have been times where the business
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
owners were struggling and i hadn't been
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
paid actually for weeks on end but
 
01:55:40.159 --> 01:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
paid actually for weeks on end but
because

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted the my community to be
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
successful and i care about small
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
i decided to keep it to myself but after
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time i actually did
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%

raising like the sub
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%

mr chairperson and the committee i'm
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
claudia estelle i live in acworth
 
01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
i'm representing myself
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:48.870 align:start position:0%
i'm representing myself
[Music]

01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
wage issues are something that are
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
important to me is a moral issue
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
and also as a practical issue i have
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
written testimony that i submitted
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
online and i don't want to waste your
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
time repeating myself
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
or and
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly on things that you've
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
but our two points i'd like to bring up
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
please are
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think that tipped wage workers often
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
are subject to harassment
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
and to discrimination
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
if the if your
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
server is
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
younger or more attractive people are
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
more likely to pay to leave a larger
 
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.390 align:start position:0%
more likely to pay to leave a larger
chip

01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
chip
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
which is not necessarily fair to the
 
01:58:38.719 --> 01:58:39.830 align:start position:0%
which is not necessarily fair to the
worker

01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
worker
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
and particularly during covid um
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
tipped workers are often submitted to a
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
lot of harassment it's kind of like oh
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
take down your mask i want to be able to
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
see what you look like and see whether
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
you're smiling or not just so i can
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
determine what your tip is going to be
 
01:58:55.599 --> 01:58:58.629 align:start position:0%
determine what your tip is going to be
um

01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is is that
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
in this state we have a big problem with
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
a worker shortage
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is not just a purview of
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
your committee um there's a affordable
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
housing shortage there's a lack of
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
affordable daycare
 
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.189 align:start position:0%
affordable daycare
but

01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
being able to pay people appropriately
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
is something that you
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
you can make a difference on by passing
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
this bill and i would encourage you to
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have
 
01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have

01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%

good afternoon rudy ogden deputy
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%

02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
folks have the one thing i did want to
 
02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:04.709 align:start position:0%
folks have the one thing i did want to
clarify

02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
is relative to individuals with
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're uh you are correct
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh members who spoke to that law having
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
been changed some time ago there is
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
still an allowance for individuals with
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities to be paid at a sub-minimum
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
rate if they're part of a training
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
or rehabilitation program so there is
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
still that allowance but in a
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
generalized sense that was changed a
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
couple years ago so i just wanted to
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
clarify on that point happy to answer
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
i do have a question for you
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%

high school and post-secondary student
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
workers with disabilities now i'm
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%

02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
is that still
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
in our law
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
is this still applicable 22 aaa is still
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
applicable okay and it talks about being
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
able to
petition

02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
petition
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
to request a
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage for high school students
 
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
or post secondary students correct
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
correct does anyone ever do that
 
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
correct does anyone ever do that
yes

02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
could you give us an example of
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
one in the last uh
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
year or so so typically we would refer
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
to that as school to work and that does
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
come up in the context of internships
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
quite often there will be employers who
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
through an arrangement with a college
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
they will say that um
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
this employee this student might work
 
02:01:37.199 --> 02:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
this employee this student might work
um

02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're not really paying them sub
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
minimum there are some unpaid
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
internships though that work through
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
so it comes up it does come up quite
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
and one last question
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
other than the internships
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
have you seen any proposals in the last
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
two years that outline
 
02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
two years that outline
a

02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage of say
 
02:02:03.679 --> 02:02:04.629 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage of say
dollars

02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
or six dollars or something else other
 
02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
or six dollars or something else other
than

02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know these unpaid internship type
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
things off the top of my head no
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you deputy
 
02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you deputy
ogden

02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
ogden
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:02:23.199 --> 02:02:24.550 align:start position:0%
there was
testimony

02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
earlier about situations where
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the server has not been paid
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriate you know the full
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
minimum wage based on their
 
02:02:35.119 --> 02:02:36.310 align:start position:0%
minimum wage based on their
uh

02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
on their sub minimum and the tips
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh a nice i see that this is something
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
that a person can do that if they make
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
thirty 30 a month which seems like very
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
other low but do you have people
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
reporting such such situations
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
and might that be
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
that they don't happen or that they are
 
02:02:56.719 --> 02:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
that they don't happen or that they are
as

02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
intimidated about reporting being you
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
know shorted on their on their wages
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
i would say that this most often when it
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
does come up it's not involving a
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
scenario in which the employer is just
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
paying the sub minimum it's when the
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
employer is not paying at all so if you
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
have an employer that's uh just not
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
doing anything right there are instances
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
in which they're not paying their
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
servers the sub minimum rate
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
arizona representative avaloni
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner um
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
this would repeal
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
27921 the entire section
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
is that my understanding
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
correct our understanding of this
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it's replacing 21
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
the existing statute that sets forth the
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
subminimum rate for tipped workers
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
um and tracks to the federal uh minimum
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
wage overall it's replacing it with the
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
language here correct
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
and follow mr chairman follow up um one
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
of these limitations says it doesn't
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
apply to outside salesmen and things
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
like that so would salesmen that are
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
commissioned or anything like that be
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
having now having to be paid minimum
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
wage even if they're not bringing in any
 
02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:14.709 align:start position:0%
wage even if they're not bringing in any
business

02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
i do think you'd have to look at the
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
other exceptions that are set forth in
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
well but they're being repealed
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
everything that whole sections being
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think it would have to be
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the effects of that i think
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
one more yes please
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
and 22 aaa
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
i know you guys went through that about
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
like work study or if you're in a trade
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
and you're working to trade
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
like you're being an electrician in your
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
off week of school and things like that
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
they're gonna be required to be paying
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
these people
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
minimum wage now
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
if unless they have an exemption
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i'm clear on
 
02:05:08.239 --> 02:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i'm clear on
that

02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
so again my understanding of this
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is it says notwithstanding
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
or accept as provided so i believe it
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
allows what's happening in 22a to
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
continue to happen
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
so if you had those requests for
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
internships or other opportunities where
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's a learning and experience
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
component to it which again we most
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
often call school to work but there's
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
other arrangements like that those and
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
see on line six where it says accept as
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
provided in rsa 279 22a
 
02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
provided in rsa 279 22a
okay

02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
commissioner

commissioner
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
any questions for the commissioner to my
 
02:05:48.079 --> 02:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
any questions for the commissioner to my
right

02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
to my left representative mandeville yes
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
deputy ogden um
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth referred
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
previously to
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
the current 279 21
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
the employer needs to make up a
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:13.830 align:start position:0%
difference between
the

02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
amount of tips received and the minimum
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
wage if if the former falls short
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
in that respect
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
the current 279 21 says
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
if such an employee show and such an
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
employee includes restaurant workers for
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
example among others if such an employee
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
shows to the satisfaction of the
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner that the actual amount of
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
wages received at the end of each pay
 
02:06:36.639 --> 02:06:37.510 align:start position:0%
wages received at the end of each pay
period

02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
did not equal the minimum wage for all
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
hours worked the employer shall pay the
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
employee the difference to guarantee the
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
federal statutory minimum wage
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
could you give us a sense of the
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
experience in
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.709 align:start position:0%
the department
regarding

02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
those issues raised proof offered
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
decisions made in other words give us a
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
how this statutory provision
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
happens as as
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know in the daily life of the
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
department so i think as i referenced
 
02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
earlier most often when we run into
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
instances here it's not a matter of
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
where the employer
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
is only paying 327 and then not doing
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
the truing up it's most often that the
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
employer is paying nothing so it's the
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
employers having financial problems or
 
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're just paying nothing so most
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
often that is how it's come up oddly
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
enough the other instance in which it's
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
come up as a problem particular to this
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
statute is if you do the math if you
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually do the division of it it's like
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
three the the minimum or sub-minimum
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
rate should be 326 with like trailing
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
decimal we have had employers who are
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
only paying 326. of course you can't pay
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
fractions of a cent so they should be
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
paying 327. so i'm not trying to get
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
lost in the weeds but if you're actually
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
asking how have we interacted with this
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
statute it's most often saying you're
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
not paying 326 and running decimal you
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
should be paying 327 or it's they're
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
paying nothing
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
we don't we have not had many instances
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
in which the the
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
the instance is i didn't make enough
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
tips to make hole and my employer only
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
paid me that it's that i didn't make
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
enough tips and my employer paid me
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
nothing or my employer paid me nothing
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i still made tips so that's most
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
often how it's come up or been dealt
 
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:22.870 align:start position:0%
often how it's come up or been dealt
with

02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:24.950 align:start position:0%
with
follow-up

02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
do you think that's because those
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
latter circumstances don't exist or they
 
02:08:30.079 --> 02:08:31.109 align:start position:0%
latter circumstances don't exist or they
just

02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
are difficult for employees to bring to
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
well i i couldn't say i mean
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative cahill brought up this
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
idea of folks being intimidated to reach
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
out sadly i can't speak to the fact if
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's folks who are too intimidated to
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
come forward i'm not aware of that
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
again my generalized understanding our
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
inspections that we've done uh we do a
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
lot of inspections of restaurants and
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
hospitalities we typically are not
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing the we're seeing no payment or
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing them pay
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then the truing up is happening and
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
if the place is actually functional
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
usually the tips are enough because
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
again the minimum wage is not that high
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think was said earlier the minimum
 
02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
i think was said earlier the minimum
wage

02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty low so between the 3 27 and
 
02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
is pretty low so between the 3 27 and
tips

02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
tips
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes is happening if the
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
place is not functional at all or is
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
just failing or if there's other things
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
going on that's i think when it comes up
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
and those are the instances in which
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the deputy
 
02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.270 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the deputy
commissioner

02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
cena thank you very much
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative schultz i take uh a point
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
of reading body language and and you
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
shook your head a number of times so if
 
02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:40.629 align:start position:0%
shook your head a number of times so if
you

02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
so if you would like to make a brief
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
comment uh before we break for lunch um
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a bad poker player i do
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
wear my feelings honestly i will say
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
what i know for sure
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
is too many workers especially tipped
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
wage workers don't know their rights
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
they believe their hourly wage is only
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
the 3 27.
 
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
the 3 27.
uh

02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
they realize they get tips if they don't
 
02:10:15.119 --> 02:10:16.390 align:start position:0%
they realize they get tips if they don't
make

02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
7 25 an hour which is our federal
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
there are multiple ways you can account
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
by hour
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm certain that it doesn't always
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
work out that way it's complicated it's
 
02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
work out that way it's complicated it's
difficult

02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
honestly the the easiest way to fix this
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
is to get rid of the subminimum wage
 
02:10:36.239 --> 02:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
is to get rid of the subminimum wage
category

02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
the second thing i'll say and again i
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you calling me back up
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
because i wouldn't have asked for this
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is specifically
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
about the sub-minimum wage category
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
when authoring this bill with uh
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
tony dean tangelino i believe that's how
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
you pronounce his last name who writes
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
most all the labor bills
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
um i did ask about the
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
sales by commission
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
the special category that
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
licensed workers like hairdressers who
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
rent a booth and essentially they're on
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
commission as well
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is a whole other segment of the law
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
i will double check
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
but that was not intended to be affected
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
this was specifically targeting
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
subminimum wages
 
02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
subminimum wages
um

02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
as i understand it currently only
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
affects and it called it used to call
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
out specific i think that y'all got rid
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
of this last year when you changed how
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
wages were paid instead of a percentage
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
to go to a specific number but it
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
included a number of tipped wage worker
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
categories you know caddies
 
02:11:49.119 --> 02:11:50.709 align:start position:0%
categories you know caddies
busboys

02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
busboys
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know that sort of thing
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
um sky caps um
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and the student portion
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
and i also just happen to know like
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
college work study programs
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
is affected by federal law it is a
 
02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
is affected by federal law it is a
specific

02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
federally aided program
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
and minimum wage applies
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
to that but rarely do students make that
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
i was a poor college student who made
 
02:12:17.119 --> 02:12:18.069 align:start position:0%
i was a poor college student who made
that

02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:18.079 --> 02:12:19.589 align:start position:0%
that
so

02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that's helpful no thank you but
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
it is the intention because i heard your
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
concerns the intention isn't to affect
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
any of the
um

02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
any of those categories
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
that aren't
 
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
under traditional wage categories like
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissions and rentals of booths and
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
those are another category of worker i'm
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
pretty sure at least that was the
 
02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:41.669 align:start position:0%
pretty sure at least that was the
intention

02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
intention
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan you have a
 
02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.189 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan you have a
question

02:12:47.189 --> 02:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
more of a comment just to clarify what
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the representative is
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
is saying
 
02:12:52.639 --> 02:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
is saying
um

02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
279 colon 21 is a fairly substantial
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it appears that this
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
this bill replaces all of 279 21 with
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
one sentence okay
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
um if it was if that was not the intent
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
then i would suggest that this bill does
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
not represent your intent
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
need some study
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
unless the committee likes it as it is i
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's your bill at this point i you know
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
i've stated our intent
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no other oh i'm sorry
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%

sullivan brought it up i brought it up

02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
including all the subsections with one
 
02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:27.589 align:start position:0%
including all the subsections with one
sentence

correct and i apologize if i wasn't
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
clear our reading of this would be that
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
all of those things would have to looked
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
at as being taken
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%

but
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's a rarity oh
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
um it is uh
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%

private parties
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
so people are still going in there
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're shut down
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
by the state but he has

yes
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
when she said that well i didn't want to
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
get him into trouble
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
so she's not getting paid for
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
those months
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then she comes as well because my
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%

03:03:03.269 --> 03:03:03.279 align:start position:0%

03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
and and call ellen reed as prime sponsor
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
to testify on behalf of your bill
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
once again and for the final time today
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee if i
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
may be so bold i think that today my
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
bills have gone from at least
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
controversial to more controversial i
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
see a
 
03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
stack of pink cards piling up against me
 
03:03:30.389 --> 03:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
over there but
 
03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the record my name
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
is ellen reed i represent rockingham 17
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
new market in newfields um so this is
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
another bill that's been
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
before you in various versions in the
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
past or before this committee more
 
03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
past or before this committee more
specifically

03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
this bill has two parts
 
03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
this bill has two parts
it

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:03:51.830 --> 03:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
requires that an employer
 
03:03:53.429 --> 03:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
provide a work schedule to their
 
03:03:53.439 --> 03:03:54.870 align:start position:0%
provide a work schedule to their
employees

03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
at least a week in advance
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it requires a rest period of 10
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
hours between shifts on consecutive days
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
this only applies to essentially medium
 
03:04:07.750 --> 03:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
and up sized companies that have either
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
10 employees or more or have two
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
locations or more in the state
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
so i'll take the two pieces separately
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
scheduling of
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
of employees work schedules and working
 
03:04:21.359 --> 03:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
of employees work schedules and working
hours

03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:25.429 align:start position:0%
hours
essentially

03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
if you don't provide a schedule in
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
advance to your employees they can't
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
schedule their lives
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
all of us here are here today because we
 
03:04:37.269 --> 03:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
have scheduled things in our lives
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
around our duties here but an employee
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
who doesn't get an advance schedule of
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
their work
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't schedule their lives oh can you
 
03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
make it to
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
this baseball game
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know yet i haven't gotten my
 
03:04:52.150 --> 03:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
schedule yet can you make it to this
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
birthday party i don't know can you make
 
03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
it to the state house to testify on a
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill you really care about i don't know
 
03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
yet i haven't got my schedule yet and
 
03:05:00.790 --> 03:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
you do have some employers
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
that may not provide their employees
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
with the work schedule until literally
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
the day before they have to work
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
um i have been in contact with some of
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are opposing the bill and
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to work with them on
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
language i know that different
 
03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
industries may look different and i'm
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
happy to work around that when employees
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
are not being negatively impacted but my
 
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
point is is that people
 
03:05:26.309 --> 03:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
the the effect that you have when you
 
03:05:28.230 --> 03:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't provide a work schedule to an
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
employee is that employee is constantly
 
03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
on call right they don't know
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
if they're gonna have to work and so
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
they have to keep their schedule free
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the possibility of work now we have
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
to pay on call labor and if i can't
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
schedule my life and live my personal
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
life and do the things the hobbies the
 
03:05:48.469 --> 03:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
interests the passions that i have
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
deepening relationships with people i
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
care about the things that make life
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
worth living and i have to hold off on
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
that because i just don't know whether
 
03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
or not my employer is going to make me
 
03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:57.429 align:start position:0%
or not my employer is going to make me
work

03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
for fear of losing my job
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
then that's that's not really fair
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's on call time and honestly i it's
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
not in the bill but it should be paid as
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
such if you're going to make me hold off
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
on my private life
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
so the exemptions here do allow for
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
employees to
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
pick up switch shifts agree agree to
 
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
work request to work days that are not
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
in their schedule
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
but essentially from i think for most
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
industries and as i said before i'm
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
investigate different industries
 
03:06:30.790 --> 03:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
realities on the ground and
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
possible exemptions
 
03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
but for most industries if you as a
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
manager can schedule one day in advance
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
then you can schedule seven days in
 
03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
advance and if people can't make it and
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
you have to to switch shifts then then
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
you can do that then but that at least
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
guarantees the employees the right to
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
say this wasn't on my original schedule
 
03:06:50.710 --> 03:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
i've already
 
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
promised i'm going to this baseball game
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
i've already scheduled my doctor's
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
appointment whatever it is and and say
 
03:06:55.920 --> 03:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
appointment whatever it is and and say
no

03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the other piece to this
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
is the rest period so i have a minimum
 
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
rest period of 10 hours between work
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
shifts on consecutive days
 
03:07:12.550 --> 03:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
so essentially if you think about a
 
03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:13.830 align:start position:0%
so essentially if you think about a
normal

03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
normal
 
03:07:16.150 --> 03:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
person's work schedule and they get out
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
of work and they have eight hours i'm
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
just gonna go with eight
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
um they have eight hours between the end
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
of their work shift in the next work
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
shift on the next day
 
03:07:26.479 --> 03:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
shift on the next day
they

03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
drive home from work get home
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
get undressed
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
make dinner
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
take care of the kids put them to bed
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
put themselves to bed
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
they might have five hours or so of
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
sleep before they have to wake up do all
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
of those things get their kids ready for
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
school make breakfast
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
shower all of that and then get to work
 
03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:49.349 align:start position:0%
shower all of that and then get to work
again

03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're literally making people lose sleep
 
03:07:53.670 --> 03:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
by not ensuring that they have enough
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
time off in between shifts
 
03:07:56.160 --> 03:07:58.389 align:start position:0%
time off in between shifts
so

03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
i did it say consecutive days for a
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
reason i'm exempting the dreaded split
 
03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
reason i'm exempting the dreaded split
shift

03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
shift
 
03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
and being on the labor uh committee i
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
presume you know a slit shift is but
 
03:08:10.230 --> 03:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'll just share a little bit of my story
 
03:08:12.309 --> 03:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
i did mention before that i'm a cdl
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
driver and i drove for public transit
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i had to work split shifts and what
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
that meant is i had to wake up at 4 am
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
get to work by 4 45-ish depending on the
 
03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:22.950 align:start position:0%
get to work by 4 45-ish depending on the
day

03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
i do a shift where depending on the day
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'd work from about 4 45 to 11 or 12 in
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of the day clock out and then
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
because i'm a state rep i drive up to
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
concord like a mad woman usually
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
changing my clothes in the car
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
i get up here i do legislative work i
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
drive like a mad woman back for 4 p.m
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
work again clock in again at 4 pm clock
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
out at 9 pm by the time i get home it's
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
10 and i have to get up at four again
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's a split shift now i don't like it
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
but some industries need it so that is
 
03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
but some industries need it so that is
exempted

03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
exempted
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanna
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
let you know that i did exempt that so
 
03:09:00.070 --> 03:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's consecutive days
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
so again
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
the aim of the rest period is similar to
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the schedule in that we need to give
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
people time to do the things that make
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
life worth living otherwise you're just
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
living to work and i don't think anybody
 
03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
thinks it's what we should be doing
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
um so i do want to say and this is a
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
argument i know you're going to hear
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
some of the same arguments
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
against this as you've heard against
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
other bills previously today
 
03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
other bills previously today
but

03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments is well they don't
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
have to employees don't have to do this
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
but they do if they want to keep their
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
job right like they have to to keep
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
their job so it is a have to because you
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
need to pay rent and you need to buy
 
03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
need to pay rent and you need to buy
food

03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
food
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is and i was very
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
conservative in that i put the bill in
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
um as it already existed previously i
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't think i necessarily would have
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
worded it exactly like this but i wanted
 
03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
worded it exactly like this but i wanted
to

03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
kind of work with language that was
 
03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
kind of work with language that was
familiar

03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
on page two the the top paragraph there
 
03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's an existing rsa that has to do with
 
03:10:05.349 --> 03:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
sunday it says no employer shall operate
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
such any such business on sunday
 
03:10:11.429 --> 03:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
um and then accept yada yada and the the
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
drafting lawyer as they had done in the
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
past kind of um tweaked it a little bit
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
but honestly if it were me i would
 
03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
strike that entire i don't know that
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like a blue law right i
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're treating sunday
 
03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're treating sunday
special

03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'm just saying
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
these this is the intent people need
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
time to work they need some breathing
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
room i'm happy to work on amendments
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
that help um
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy but and with that
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to take questions
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands that was one of my
 
03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
first comments line one employer no
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
employer shall operate any such
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
business on sundays unless
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
so is this only applicable for sundays
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
that is as i said sir that is existing
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
rsa and so i just simply didn't strike
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
existing rsa but that is in our current
 
03:11:05.590 --> 03:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
law as you can see
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
where there's strikes in language added
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph so that means that
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not my new paragraph
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
under line six
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
whoever violates the section shall be
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
fined fifty dollars um i just thought it
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know it should be employer or
 
03:11:24.790 --> 03:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
manager or owner whoever i you know
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to find a
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would take that entire paragraph out
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
as i've already said it but again i put
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
it in as it already had existed and
 
03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
it in as it already had existed and
without

03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
i should say minimal changes to current
 
03:11:36.319 --> 03:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
i should say minimal changes to current
rsa

03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
on line 14 15 and 16 you talk about
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
compensation for time and a half uh
 
03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
before working through rest periods
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention that that
 
03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
could entice employees who want to get
 
03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
paid more to
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
03:11:56.870 --> 03:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
your thoughts i
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
just had part of this conversation with
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of the people who will be
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
testifying against about that very
 
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
portion and you did hear you know a bill
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
earlier today about time and a half
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
compensation and some of those arguments
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
will be the same i am fine with removing
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
that like i said this is a bill as it's
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
previously existed not as i tailored it
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative prout and representative
 
03:12:30.309 --> 03:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
after that
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
um
what

03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
do you see would prevent an employer if
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
this were to become law from scheduling
 
03:12:39.279 --> 03:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
this were to become law from scheduling
someone

03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
to work say
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
nine to five seven days a week
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
and then calling them and canceling the
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
days they don't actually need them to
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically work around this
 
03:12:51.670 --> 03:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
because we actually have existing rsas
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
about the procedures for
 
03:12:55.110 --> 03:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
canceling previously scheduled work that
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to change
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good point and again
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
i put this in as it already existed and
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to look at amendments to fix
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that but i do very very strongly believe
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
we need to have some protections in
 
03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
place to allow employees
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
to know that they're going to have time
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
off to do the rest of their life so if
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
we can find a way around to make
 
03:13:19.269 --> 03:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
everybody happy that is what i will go
 
03:13:19.279 --> 03:13:20.469 align:start position:0%
everybody happy that is what i will go
for

03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman you
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
inspired me with your line by line
 
03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:29.269 align:start position:0%
inspired me with your line by line
questions

03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
there was one other i i wondered about
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
online nine of page two
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's an exception to it all if the
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
employee requests or consents that seems
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
really broad
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
if an employee shows up to work isn't
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
that not consent which means
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
does it
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
apply at all i'm wondering about the
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
language no i i also did in fact i don't
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
know if you can see from there but i
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
literally circled or consents
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
already knowing that this is a work in
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
progress knowing that this committee has
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
had difficulties in the past with this
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
again this is a starting point and i
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
want to really work towards the goal of
 
03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:09.429 align:start position:0%
want to really work towards the goal of
yes

03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
understanding all the different
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
industries particulars and what works
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:21.429 --> 03:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
so you know the questions of the
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and don't worry i'm
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
done for the day
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have fun with the next guy
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
just because
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
i like him
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
a man with many titles
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
honorable mr speaker
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
mr department head mr commissioner
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
sean jasper
 
03:14:44.790 --> 03:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
nice to see you in front of labor
 
03:14:46.229 --> 03:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's certainly
 
03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
nice to be here again twice in one day
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i am still sean
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
jasper and still the commissioner of
 
03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:55.429 align:start position:0%
jasper and still the commissioner of
agriculture

03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
03:14:55.439 --> 03:14:57.269 align:start position:0%
agriculture
so

03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
i do see this as a a bill again you
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
could take much of the the testimony
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
which mr chairman you were introducing
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
your own bill you didn't hear me earlier
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
but much of the testimony that i said
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
that this could be very harmful
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
to agriculture you know you get into
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
having to pay people time and a half
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
much of the same
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
still applies there are many times when
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
because of the weather those work shifts
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
03:15:22.720 --> 03:15:24.070 align:start position:0%
are going to be
extended

03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
extended
 
03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
so you might be thinking you're going to
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
work till
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
five or six but there's a rainstorm
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
coming in and you're going to work till
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
dark which goes beyond there and again
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's no additional income
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
to pay for that it was work you were
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
planning on doing perhaps the next day
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
but had to get in early
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and give your employees the time off i
 
03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
and give your employees the time off i
think

03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:15:47.670 --> 03:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in this work environment
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
people have to
 
03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
people have to
to

03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
treat their employees well if you don't
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose them there are a
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there and i and i
 
03:15:56.720 --> 03:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there and i and i
question

03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
the timing of putting in
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
bills such as is this one because the
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
economy is extraordinarily uh
 
03:16:09.910 --> 03:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
favorable to to employees at this time
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
but we have to be
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
mindful of
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
the difficulties
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that employers face because of the
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
shortage of workers
 
03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:22.070 align:start position:0%
shortage of workers
and

03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
many people who choose to work in in
 
03:16:26.950 --> 03:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
fields my daughter's in the restaurant
 
03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
industry and while at this point she's
 
03:16:33.190 --> 03:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
on salary even when she was on
 
03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:34.229 align:start position:0%
on salary even when she was on
hourly

03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
hourly
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
work she was being called in
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
many many times
 
03:16:39.920 --> 03:16:41.110 align:start position:0%
many many times
um

03:16:41.110 --> 03:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to commit
 
03:16:44.479 --> 03:16:45.349 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to commit
and

03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
so then her
 
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
schedule was adjusted adjusted that's
 
03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
part of the industry that's part of of
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
agriculture and i think that um you know
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have to be to be mindful
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
of that and not put undue burdens
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
on employers while i appreciate what the
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor said
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
virtually all employee employers today
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
if an employee asks for time off in
 
03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
if an employee asks for time off in
advance

03:17:11.110 --> 03:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
advance
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
they work around that schedule i do find
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
that having a full week
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
have that schedule posted can be
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
very burdensome because of those type of
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
things people often
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
find out about a an event and like oh i
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
need this off
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
in five days
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
and well that's fine if you're doing a
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
schedule the week before which most
 
03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
schedule the week before which most
employees

03:17:35.190 --> 03:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
employers small employers do
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
now what do you do because now you've
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
got a hole you need to grant that
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
employee that period of time but
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's scheduled and
 
03:17:45.359 --> 03:17:46.229 align:start position:0%
everybody's scheduled and
so

03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know all in all
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
we need to let the market um
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
work businesses run as they have been i
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
don't think there's
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
um a need at this time and particularly
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
for government intervention into this
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
area i'll conclude my testimony
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
with that and now mr chairman you can
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
have your fun
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for the commissioner
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i have one are there the federal
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
government puts out
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
rules regarding
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
time off between shifts for airline
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
pilots train engineers
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
cld drivers on with their with their
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
logs and stuff is there anything in the
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
agriculture business that the federal
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
government has certainly not that i have
 
03:18:32.790 --> 03:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
heard of or am aware of so
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe so there is
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of flexibility with with
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture due to
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
it is so weather dependent and depend
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
dependent on
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
um having to have people do certain jobs
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
at certain times as i said
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
this morning you don't have the luxury
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
of saying oh well we'll milk the cows

03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
is this really a problem that needs to
 
03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
be corrected
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
and if it is is it reasonable to believe
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that every business
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
has the same issues the same constraints
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
ability or inability to be flexible
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
that demands a one-size-fits-all
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
solution and
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
my experience is the answer to that is
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
no there are some specific
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill i'd like to bring
 
03:20:19.359 --> 03:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill i'd like to bring
up

03:20:20.710 --> 03:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:20:22.229 --> 03:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
one of which is
 
03:20:25.990 --> 03:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to distinguish between
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
what we call exempt or non-exempt
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
employees hourly versus those like
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
myself that are on salary
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
i don't my employer doesn't have
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
a work schedule for me i have job
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and i'm expected to to
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
meet those responsibilities and it's not
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
tied to me being in at the office at
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
nine and leaving at five so this
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill is uncle it seems to indicate it
 
03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
applies to everybody
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
so does that mean employers who have
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
salaried individuals are now going to
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
work schedules for those individuals
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:21:02.720 --> 03:21:04.630 align:start position:0%
that are
conspicuously

03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
conspicuously
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
noticed in the workplace
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
and speaking about conspicuous notice
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is a little unclear on
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
what has to be conspicuous in the notice
 
03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
is this referring to just general work
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
schedules of the organization
 
03:21:22.630 --> 03:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
or is it referring to specific
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
individuals because there are many
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
companies manufacturing companies
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
financial services companies
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
they may have a thousand employees or
 
03:21:30.880 --> 03:21:31.830 align:start position:0%
they may have a thousand employees or
more

03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:21:33.990 --> 03:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so is the bill requiring the
 
03:21:36.870 --> 03:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
employer to have some type of
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
huge wall chart whichever with
 
03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's individual schedules noted
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
not just in english but in a second
 
03:21:44.479 --> 03:21:45.670 align:start position:0%
not just in english but in a second
language

03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
that may be used within the workplace so
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
it just seems
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
at very many levels to be impractical
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
and again i get back to is this really
 
03:21:56.800 --> 03:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
and again i get back to is this really
necessary

03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
employers right now are under a lot of
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
constraints which i mentioned in
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
previous testimony earlier today
 
03:22:08.550 --> 03:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we are asking for
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility every business is different
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
and we need to trust uh the managers and
 
03:22:16.309 --> 03:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
owners of those businesses that they
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
will conduct uh themselves you know in a
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
way that is good for the employees and
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
the business no employer wants to have
 
03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
an employee who's falling asleep on the
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
job because they've had insufficient
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
time between their previous
 
03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:35.670 align:start position:0%
time between their previous
work

03:22:35.670 --> 03:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the other hand some employees or some
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
employers may want to have the
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility to ask someone to work
 
03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
overtime in a crunch time which it seems
 
03:22:48.150 --> 03:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
like this bill would prohibit so mr
 
03:22:50.229 --> 03:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
chair that concludes my testimony i'd be
 
03:22:52.630 --> 03:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
03:22:54.389 --> 03:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr javier any questions
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.190 --> 03:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
mr gervais one thing i didn't hear in
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony was
 
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh reference to page two line ten
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
um or line seven through what looks like
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
thirteen uh where we're talking about
 
03:23:15.269 --> 03:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh mandatory rest periods uh in between
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
shifts can i get uh your opinion or
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
position on that specific segment
 
03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:22.469 align:start position:0%
position on that specific segment
um

03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
when you say page two are you referring
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's labeled as page two okay yeah and
 
03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:32.150 align:start position:0%
it's labeled as page two okay yeah and
um

03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks like section yeah it's
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
well i guess i have a couple of comments
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
this doesn't the the whole question
 
03:23:52.150 --> 03:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
about consent has already been brought
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
up and is a little vague
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh the second thing
 
03:23:59.190 --> 03:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
is and i recognize that the sponsor says
 
03:24:01.269 --> 03:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
this was not something she
 
03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
intentionally had in there but the
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
compentate compensation at one and a
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
half times is something we addressed
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
earlier today that is something that
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that i don't think is
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
necessary or something the bia could
 
03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
necessary or something the bia could
support

03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i would say
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
just in general
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:24.309 --> 03:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a with a
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
assuming you first of all believe that
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a problem that needs to be
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
corrected coming up with a
 
03:24:28.239 --> 03:24:30.710 align:start position:0%
corrected coming up with a
one-size-fits-all

03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
um solution for every business generally
 
03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
will create more problems than than
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're trying to solve
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow up uh with permission from the
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
chair can i provide context with the
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
kind of question that i'm trying to ask
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
um in in researching this bill um i
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
found some information from the national
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
highway traffic and safety
 
03:24:55.359 --> 03:24:56.950 align:start position:0%
highway traffic and safety
administration

03:24:56.950 --> 03:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there were about 700 vehicle
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
fatalities associated with drowsy
 
03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:03.269 align:start position:0%
fatalities associated with drowsy
driving

03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
driving
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you have employers in the state of
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where it's a
 
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
depending on where you live longer
 
03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:09.910 align:start position:0%
depending on where you live longer
commute

03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
commute
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
and you don't have
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of rest period in between it
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
raises the elevation for a potential
 
03:25:16.399 --> 03:25:18.309 align:start position:0%
raises the elevation for a potential
fatality

03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
fatality
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
is there will from
 
03:25:25.349 --> 03:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
either yourself or the via
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
um to do something uh with this
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
um having a mandatory rest period in
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
between as an end to reducing vehicle
 
03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:36.710 align:start position:0%
between as an end to reducing vehicle
fatalities

03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
fatalities
 
03:25:38.950 --> 03:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate the question and you
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know each other well but
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
some people here know that for many many
 
03:25:45.190 --> 03:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
years i worked for
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
aaa the auto club specifically in their
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
traffic safety department and worked on
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of legislation relating to that
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
especially to drunk driving and seat
 
03:25:58.950 --> 03:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
i don't recall ever
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
working on
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation requiring mandatory break
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
time to reduce instances of fatigue but
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from my personal
 
03:26:13.190 --> 03:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
experience that i do appreciate
 
03:26:16.389 --> 03:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
that there is are risks inherent with
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
fatigued driving which is
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
why to the chair's question earlier
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
there are federal regulations for
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
commercial truck drivers in terms of the
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
amount of time they can spend on the
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
road and the amount of break times that
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
between the times that they're driving
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
so it's recognized as an issue i
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
maintain that most employers
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
are reasonable and don't want to put
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
their employees at any um
 
03:26:47.190 --> 03:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary risk but i will also say
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
probably many instances where an
 
03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
probably many instances where an
employee

03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:26:57.510 --> 03:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
so and so didn't come up come into work
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
today i just found out is there any way
 
03:27:03.429 --> 03:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
you can come in
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
earlier and it not be
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
outside of that 10 hour minimum and
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
for most reasonable the employer
 
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
employers the employee can say i can't i
 
03:27:17.190 --> 03:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
can't keep my eyes open right now i
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't think i can drive safely
 
03:27:19.439 --> 03:27:20.630 align:start position:0%
don't think i can drive safely
so

03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
my preference is always to let this work
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
out between the employee and the
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
employer i mentioned
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
earlier today that this is not
 
03:27:29.279 --> 03:27:30.309 align:start position:0%
earlier today that this is not
a

03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're not living through a time where
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
employers can
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
enact draconian policies without a
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
negative ramification of employees
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
leaving because it's too easy to find
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:47.429 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um you did and
 
03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
the regulations regarding uh pilots and
 
03:27:55.349 --> 03:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
truck drivers and train
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
drivers were brought up
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe there's a similar
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
mechanical risk to operating a truck
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
with that kind of sleep deprivation to
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
driving a car for a commute i i
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i have a background in
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
traffic safety issues i would readily
 
03:28:13.269 --> 03:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%

03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%

1094
 
03:28:59.439 --> 03:29:01.429 align:start position:0%
1094
and

03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier this morning i
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
represent the commercial and
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
construction industry both highway and
 
03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:08.550 align:start position:0%
construction industry both highway and
building

03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
really doesn't fit the construction
 
03:29:12.399 --> 03:29:13.990 align:start position:0%
really doesn't fit the construction
industry

03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
clearly we are scheduling sometimes
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
daily every other day
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
the seven day just does not work for us
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh we did talk to i did talk to the
 
03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor we actually both talked to the
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor before the hearing
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
this just would be so problematic for us
 
03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
this just would be so problematic for us
to

03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:35.190 --> 03:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
all entertain now i know the sponsor
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
talked about maybe making an exemption
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh but that i think
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
this has ramifications on the second
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
part as well with the uh
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
10 hour and the rest period that we
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier this morning
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
i have with me amy charbonneau from
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
continental paving
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
definitely involved in scheduling within
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
her company and i don't know if you want
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
continental paving we do paving
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
construction heavy highway all
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we have about 350
 
03:30:07.439 --> 03:30:09.269 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we have about 350
employees

03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
99 of them are from new hampshire
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
when our employees come into the
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
construction industry they they know
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
what industry they're in
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
but we also know how tough the schedule
 
03:30:20.630 --> 03:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
is for them so as a family run business
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
we do a lot to do all the things that
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsor mentioned
 
03:30:27.190 --> 03:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
but not under a blanket rule that it's
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
totally different than the way we do it
 
03:30:30.229 --> 03:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
so we understand it's a lot of long
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
hours and a disruptive schedule some
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
days but what we do is we always try and
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
give weekends off we do a lot of things
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
like an early friday or we do ways to
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
make up for the things that our industry
 
03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
makes us do on a daily basis we only
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
have so many months a year to get our
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
life done
 
03:30:47.429 --> 03:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
and i guess the important part that a
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't realize or the
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor is that we don't have a door
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
that locks and unlocks you know opens in
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
the morning and closes at night we can
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a machine that breaks down and our
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
guys are two hours away and they have to
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
make it back and or we you know you have
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
10 trucks on the road full of asphalt
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the paver breaks you still have to
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
fix that paver and you still have to put
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
all that asphalt down because
 
03:31:07.030 --> 03:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
realistically the state's paying for it
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
so i got to get those guys to finish
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
their job they have to come back we
 
03:31:12.150 --> 03:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
start them late in the morning if we
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
have to we do make all those on the
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
moment adjustments but it's very hard to
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
say that what's going to happen seven
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
days prior to that and to schedule that
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
so our
 
03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
industry knows what they're doing
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
for work and i think a lot of our
 
03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
businesses new hampshire's full of
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
family businesses in this industry and
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
we do work with our employees we love
 
03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
our employees so there's that we do it
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
instead of a law doing it and i would
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
just ask that it stays that way
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and i'd just like to add
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
amy's from the highway side but the
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
building side almost does the same thing
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
with a building project
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
these projects you know you don't know
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
how long a subcontractor when he's going
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
to finish before the next subcontractor
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
could get on the job scheduling is not
 
03:31:58.630 --> 03:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
done that far out so when anybody's
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do this
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill just does i mean as soon as
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
you bring it up to my legislative
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee or my board of directors
 
03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
committee or my board of directors
immediately

03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
we we just couldn't do this and so
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here in opposition to
 
03:32:11.920 --> 03:32:12.710 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here in opposition to
it

03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:32:12.720 --> 03:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
it
um

03:32:13.510 --> 03:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know we've talked about this before
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i would leave that with the
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee and answer any questions the
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you very
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
you folks can't pay when it rains all
 
03:32:34.830 --> 03:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
right correct you had a tough time this
 
03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
year what were you what did you do
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
when we had rain every other day or two
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
or three days in a row when you still
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
had to get the work done how are you
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
able to deal with that so there's a lot
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
of times i mean we as a company i can
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
only speak for ourselves but
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
when you have two or three days in a row
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we end up paying guys for
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
eight hours they call in the morning and
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
they don't come in we're very generous
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
to our employees because we want them to
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
keep working for us
 
03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
um other days so then say it rains
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
monday tuesday on wednesday you decide
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 80 degrees and sunny on
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
saturday i gotta pave on saturday but it
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
my employees want to pave on saturday
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
because i may have paid them for one or
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
two days but i can't pay them for all
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
three so they want to work saturday
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
because they didn't they want they want
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
their overtime they live for their
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
overtime so that their wives can stay
 
03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
home i mean there's a lot of benefits to
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
what we do in the overtime it the rain
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
the weather frost in the fall i mean so
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
we may not start till nine o'clock but
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
you don't know the day before tomorrow's
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
gonna be super cold hey you i can't have
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
you come in till nine o'clock but you're
 
03:33:32.070 --> 03:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
gonna work a little later the sun's
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
coming out and it's gonna be great
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's always fluid and but
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
for the most part they work from six in
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
the morning to four or five o'clock at
 
03:33:41.680 --> 03:33:42.710 align:start position:0%
the morning to four or five o'clock at
night

03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not i can't keep it as
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
structured as the paper wants me to so
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
they generally know when they're working
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then there's a couple adjustments
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
here and there that we try and make to
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
the best of everybody's ability but we
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
as like a family want them to have
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
family time we we strive for that
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
because if a happy employee makes great
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
work so i just believe that the industry
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
let us handle it on our own it's more
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
versus legislation and paperwork and
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
office people
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any additional
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenters
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
sitting on thank you very much
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
i have though karnak has the last card
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
in his hand
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
the committee again bruce burkey with
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
sheen vinnie capital group and
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
again representing several of our
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
clients who are opposed to
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 1094
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%

03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
federation of independent business
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
all of them are opposed to this because
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the constraints that you've just
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
heard about from
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
mr abbott and ms charbonneau they gave
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
very good testimony and i won't try to
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
go above and beyond that but it is clear
 
03:35:12.399 --> 03:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
go above and beyond that but it is clear
that

03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
weather plays a huge
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
role in the tourism community
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
it does with the paving community and it
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
does with other businesses
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so it really the the businesses and
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
their and their administrative staff
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
they need the flexibility
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide the opportunities
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
for people to work here in new hampshire
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
and not to be
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
put in a straitjacket by a bill like
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
this with that i'll conclude my
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
testimony mr chair
 
03:35:45.190 --> 03:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
happy to try and address any questions
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
burkey see none thank you very much
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you oh i'm sorry
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah sorry mr chairman thank you
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful um
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
yes i um
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i note that you
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
ended your testimony by talking about
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that would be made
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
available to
 
03:36:11.190 --> 03:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
workers and
 
03:36:13.990 --> 03:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
of course this
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
excludes circumstances where
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
an employee would request
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
or consent once that gets clarified
 
03:36:27.190 --> 03:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh so i mean clearly the opportunity
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
could exist
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
my question is twofold
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
do you not see this bill as
 
03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:38.309 align:start position:0%
do you not see this bill as
um

03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:41.110 --> 03:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
already allowing for an opportunity for
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
workers to
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
gain the additional uh hours that
 
03:36:48.309 --> 03:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
they're interested in and secondly we've
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
had testimony uh such as from the
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the bia and others
 
03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:54.870 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the bia and others
about

03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:55.750 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
um
trusting

03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
trusting
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
business and and the business to to deal
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
with workers as they need to do
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
businesses could trust workers to
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
respond to the needs that the companies
 
03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:10.630 align:start position:0%
respond to the needs that the companies
have

03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
in a manner
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
that if we're trusting
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
that it could work both ways
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative that that you know there
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
are two separate distinct sections of
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the spill
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
certainly speaking to the first section
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
about having the seven day schedule in
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
advance that is the straight jacket
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
the second section what you're talking
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
about with respect to consent
 
03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
um there's there's some good there but
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's also some bad there and and the
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
bad being the time and a half pay rate
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
that would ensue and and that would uh
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
you know begin to put uh constraints on
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
on businesses because you know maybe
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
they don't offer that shift so the
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
person doesn't get the extra shift um
 
03:37:55.600 --> 03:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
person doesn't get the extra shift um
maybe

03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
they they don't say open as late
 
03:37:59.279 --> 03:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
they they don't say open as late
maybe

03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:38:03.190 --> 03:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
um you know that the next hire
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't get hired because they're paying
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
extra so i i don't think that a state
 
03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:10.710 align:start position:0%
extra so i i don't think that a state
mandate

03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what this bill would
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
put forth is uh appropriate for the
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
business community
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%

section one page i'm sorry
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
page two section one
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
line four the employees shall promptly
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
file a copy of such schedule and every
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
change therein with the labor
 
03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.389 align:start position:0%
change therein with the labor
commissioner

03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
would that
 
03:39:06.479 --> 03:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
would that
require

03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
additional staff for your
 
03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
additional staff for your
unit

03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the record uh rudy ogden deputy
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner partner of labor in terms
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
of just accepting them uh no i don't
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
think that we would need additional
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
staff in terms of accepting them
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
presumably we'd be able to receive them
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
electronically or in some other format
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
and process them
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would need
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you know how many
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
employers would be filing schedules if
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i don't have that i could
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
try and find a confirmation of what the
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
number might be
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes and the uh fine
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:57.760 --> 03:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
staffing

03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
03:39:58.880 --> 03:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
staffing
people

03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
your investigators would be going out
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
and making sure that everybody's filed
 
03:40:03.199 --> 03:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
and making sure that everybody's filed
their

03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
schedule with any relative change given
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've heard that some of
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
them are daily changes
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:40:14.309 --> 03:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
be in violation
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
if there was going to be
 
03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
someone looking at whether there was a
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
violation that would be our staff
 
03:40:19.199 --> 03:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
violation that would be our staff
correct

03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
then you would follow up yes and you
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
if it's in the law we would enforce it
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
mr ogden for coming up
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
since we have you here
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask about the the sponsor
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
talked about this kind of oddity of the
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
sunday law it
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
provides for a day of rest but is very
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
specific if that day of rest isn't
 
03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:55.349 align:start position:0%
specific if that day of rest isn't
sunday

03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
requiring that basically the employer
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
get the permission of the commissioner
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
for sunday work with some
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
explicit exceptions i was wondering if
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i you've probably done it before for
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
me but if you can
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
characterize how frequent is this done
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner has had to grant
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
permission for an employer to have
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
sunday employment
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm only aware of a few instances we
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
most recently had a request and again we
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have it specific to sunday it was
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
the day of rest because what it talks
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
about is not having folks work on a
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
sunday unless unless in the perspective
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
the next six days there's going to be a
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
day of rest i'm aware we did have a
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
request for that over the holidays it
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
was a supply chain company
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
and they in order to service or
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
prepare fulfillment they did say okay
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have no day of rest for
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
some period of time the workers are all
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
amenable to it but it is
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
infrequent all right thank you if i
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up uh just to clarify
 
03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:02.469 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up uh just to clarify
um

03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the department's
 
03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this law is if
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
is providing a day of rest that is not
 
03:42:12.239 --> 03:42:13.830 align:start position:0%
is providing a day of rest that is not
sunday

03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have any special hoops
 
03:42:20.309 --> 03:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
let's say restaurants often offer monday
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
off so they can work the weekend
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go through the
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
department to say we're moving our day
 
03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
of rest until monday and we like the
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission correct it would be looking
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
for a day of rest
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you rudy uh
 
03:42:44.469 --> 03:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner ogden um
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
the no employer with
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
page two line seven no employer with ten
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
or more employees in the state
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
would you would you
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
assume that that would be full-time
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
employees or part-time employees or
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
part-time employees that equal 10
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
full-time positions
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
based on the way it's written we would
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
assume any and all because in our laws
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
typically we do not have a distinction
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
between full-time part-time it's just a
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
matter of number of employees so again
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
for purposes of the department's
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
administration of this bill
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
we would look at 10 or more employees
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
whether they be part-time or full-time
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
03:43:20.720 --> 03:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
president

03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
president
 
03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:43:25.510 --> 03:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh deputy commissioner for taking my
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
question um the the sponsor of the bill
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
alluded to that workers need protection
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and to that i would ask do you get
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
complaints in your department about work
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling and lack of rest
 
03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:42.070 align:start position:0%
scheduling and lack of rest
i

03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
know but i would point out that perhaps
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
we're not getting those complaints
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
because there is not a protection in
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
place so i just want to be very clear on
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
but in part i believe that might be
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
because there is not an existing
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
protection or provision okay thank you
 
03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:04.469 align:start position:0%
protection or provision okay thank you
question

03:44:04.469 --> 03:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other hands
 
03:44:09.189 --> 03:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
i have no more thank you very much uh

1094 and we have 15 minutes for the next
 
03:44:22.880 --> 03:44:24.710 align:start position:0%
1094 and we have 15 minutes for the next
hearing

03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
do the members of the republican members
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
of committee understand that there will
 
03:45:10.830 --> 03:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%

03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.510 --> 03:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that was it was completely
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
inadequate but i ended up having several
 
03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle who
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
which actually
 
03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
i think we'll know because he was
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.840 --> 04:00:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.550 --> 04:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we keep my mother happy
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
gonna be on time
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh folks i have been remiss should have
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
done this
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
um these are the sign up sheets and
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
normally what we do is we'll read them
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:00:55.680 --> 04:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
you know
uh

04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
we did we kind of had a hard time doing
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
that on online
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
last session
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
we had so many people online it was very
 
04:01:05.279 --> 04:01:06.389 align:start position:0%
we had so many people online it was very
difficult

04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:01:06.399 --> 04:01:08.950 align:start position:0%
difficult
so

04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're all here for viewing um
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
two or three people signed up when they
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
usually sign up they all so in this case
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's almost every single person here who
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
signed up also testified
 
04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the most part um so if anyone would
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
like to see these but from now on i will
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
um i will ask the
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
clerk to to get me these or whatever or
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
our assistant so we can read them
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
i i know we have the opportunity to sign
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
on to um bills either in opposition or
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
support online are you getting those
 
04:01:44.479 --> 04:01:45.349 align:start position:0%
support online are you getting those
lists

04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
lists
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative i think that just
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
started two days ago
 
04:01:53.830 --> 04:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
is it i thought they just reimplemented
 
04:01:53.840 --> 04:01:57.910 align:start position:0%
is it i thought they just reimplemented
that

04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
i guess if if we're not getting copies
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
of it and being informed of it i'm not
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
sure what the point is i mean i've i've
 
04:02:48.790 --> 04:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
been signing in on bills that i think
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
are important
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
but if no one's ever seeing the fact
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
that i signed in on it i don't know what
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:12.080 --> 04:03:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
i'll give you my opinion a second but i
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions avalani cahill
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um is the
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
sheets added to the red folder at the
 
04:04:04.150 --> 04:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
end of
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that you had to
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
sign in on a bill like at a certain time
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the morning if the bill was being
 
04:04:19.920 --> 04:04:21.510 align:start position:0%
in the morning if the bill was being
heard

04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
but as far as the report i think it
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be useful at least
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
for our executive sessions to have not
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
every name read but perhaps the number
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
of people who are opposed or
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
or uh in favor of and i think the the
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
idea was to have the emails forwarded to
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you what i am going to do is uh
 
04:04:49.510 --> 04:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifically i'm going to ask heather
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
when she gets them or whoever to make
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
sure it gets sent out to that generic
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
the house labor committee site so you
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%

04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
lino i will find out
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure

those go in the permanent
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%

one of the weak points has been
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we've developed a reputation for
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
not having the most not having the most
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
responsive workman's comp system and so
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of blue-collar workers who
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
in the new england market who will not
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire and the reason is
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
that they've had a bad experience
 
04:07:24.800 --> 04:07:25.910 align:start position:0%
that they've had a bad experience
with

04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
being injured on the job through no
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
fault of their own and they
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
they get disqualified and they have to
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney and
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
fight through the system to try to get
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
compensation the the problem with that
 
04:07:39.040 --> 04:07:39.750 align:start position:0%
compensation the the problem with that
is

04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
is while you're waiting
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
usually three to six months to actually
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
get comp uh compensation
 
04:07:46.159 --> 04:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
get comp uh compensation
um

04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
you as the worker who have been injured
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
through no fault of your own
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
you as the worker are facing these
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
really high interest and penalty
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
rates you're not getting
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
if you are you're having to pay for the
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
doctor's visits and x-rays and tests on
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
your own
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of workers have faced
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
eviction repossession repossession of
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh 29 interest rates on their
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
credit cards that they have to pay while
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
they're waiting and waiting and waiting
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursements they faced foreclosure
 
04:08:17.600 --> 04:08:19.349 align:start position:0%
reimbursements they faced foreclosure
bankruptcy

04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
medical bills or medical tests that
 
04:08:22.870 --> 04:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't get performed
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
so they can't get fully diagnosed until
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
they actually go in for an mri mri could
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
be 800 or a thousand dollars just to
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
look at a small
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
section of injured tissue
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
delayed retraining longer recovery time
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
or inadequate care
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
something that might be resolved in you
 
04:08:43.030 --> 04:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
know six or eight months ends up taking
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
over two years
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
because you
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
if you don't happen to have the cash on
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
hand and you don't have your credit
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
cards already maxed out
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
um you can't get the medical care and so
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
you can't get the the
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
injury taken care of so with the intent
 
04:08:59.110 --> 04:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh was and i spoke with the department
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
of of uh
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
labor just a few minutes ago and they
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
had a number of questions on the on the
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
actual methodology but
 
04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the compromise
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
right now on workman's comp is that we
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
let the company take a discount they pay
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
only 60 percent of your base pay and
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
none of your overtime
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
right now if they start paying right
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
away and then they and
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
covering your your medical costs and
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
your doctor's visits and x-rays
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
the formula that i proposed
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
was that if a company is more than 60
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
days late if they're dragging their feet
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
or they're simply refusing to pay or
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
they're forcing you to to go through the
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
was to have them just pay 100 of your
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
base wages for anything that's more than
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
60 days behind
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
but there are other dif there are other
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
formulas there are different ways to do
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
it right now what's happening is
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
um the department of labor in a
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
particularly abusive case they can find
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
the company up to twenty five hundred
 
04:09:56.159 --> 04:09:57.269 align:start position:0%
the company up to twenty five hundred
dollars

04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
um and there's also uh
 
04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh interest that the company has to pay
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
for paying late but that rate of
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
interest is is
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh far far lower it's a very small
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
fraction of the losses faced by the
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
workers themselves
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
so if if the company's going to dispute
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
it if the company is going to fight it
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
or the company's just
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
dragging their feet or they're being
 
04:10:20.640 --> 04:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
dragging their feet or they're being
non-responsive

04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
non-responsive
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
or could be errors within uh areas of
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
communication um
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
among the
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
the two or three companies that are that
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
are processing that case
 
04:10:32.560 --> 04:10:33.429 align:start position:0%
are processing that case
um

04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
it may be the company's fault it may be
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
the adjuster's fault it may be someone
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
just went on vacation and or paperwork
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
was lost but it's not the fault
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's not the fault of the worker
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
themselves and yet the worker is the one
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
having to pay
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know the 29 interest rate on their
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
credit card the workers the one facing
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle repossession the worker is the
 
04:10:55.110 --> 04:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
one having to pay for all the costs
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
of some paperwork errors on the part of
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
the company
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not advocating for
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
creating a hostile anti-business
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
environment what i'm advocating for is
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
having a sufficient penalty maybe
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
even rewriting the bill just to increase
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
the interest rate
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
like anything else to force the company
 
04:11:14.880 --> 04:12:21.189 align:start position:0%
like anything else to force the company
for

04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying and taking
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
our questions today
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
um could you
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
on page one section lines 22 through 28.
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
can you talk me through how you arrived
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
yes i i just used the same formula
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's already
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
present where
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh if a if the adjuster pays on time
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
that they pay 60 percent of the base
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
wages and i simply said
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
using the exact same formula
 
04:12:53.600 --> 04:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
using the exact same formula
um

04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know minimum weight minimum
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
of 30 percent of the state's average
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
weekly wage or
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
no more than 250 percent of the state's
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage that's the formula
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's already used in statute
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
um instead of 60 anything that's more
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
than 60 days late they would just pay
 
04:13:10.720 --> 04:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
than 60 days late they would just pay
100

04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
100
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
on the presumption that the worker is
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
actually having to
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh fight the case
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
in other words you no longer give them
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
the 40 discount for paying on time
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not paying on time
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the same paragraph that
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
it says for payments made to an employee
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
more than 60 days after the injury is
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
first reported
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
so um this would include
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
the time period where um
 
04:14:03.600 --> 04:14:04.309 align:start position:0%
the time period where um
a

04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
employee is reported but has not yet
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
been approved for workers comp is that
 
04:14:08.960 --> 04:14:09.830 align:start position:0%
been approved for workers comp is that
correct

04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
right it's it's meant to
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's meant to get the adjuster
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
to move a little bit quicker
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
if if you're having to wait 60 days
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
after an injury that's that's two months
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
without any pay there are a lot of
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
things that go into collections within
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
60 days follow-up
 
04:14:28.960 --> 04:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
60 days follow-up
follow-up

04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
claim is denied
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
and the employee um
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
appeals the denial
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
and eventually is approved
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
all of that time would um
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
also be contributed to the 60 days is
 
04:14:47.110 --> 04:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
um that would all
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
fall under the higher 100 rate and then
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
anything paid
 
04:14:54.080 --> 04:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
anything paid
um

04:14:55.830 --> 04:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
once a judgment or ruling is made
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
against the company and they start
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
paying on time they would pay at the
 
04:15:03.269 --> 04:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
lower 60 percent rate
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
so in other words it's what what this is
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
hit the company with is
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh if you report an injury today
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and two months goes by and you now
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
realize you've got to take this to the
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
you've got to hire an attorney that's
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
he's going to take 20 percent of your
 
04:15:22.479 --> 04:15:23.429 align:start position:0%
he's going to take 20 percent of your
your

04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
total so that's going to take you down
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
from 100
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
all the way down to 80
 
04:15:29.670 --> 04:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then you're you're still
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
accumulating debt and you're still
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
accumulating interest in penalties
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
so it's meant to be anything that's more
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
than 60 days
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted to point out that i know you
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
the employee is injured through no fault
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
of his own workers comp is basically a
 
04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:54.870 align:start position:0%
of his own workers comp is basically a
no-fault

04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
no-fault
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
institution that we have to protect the
 
04:15:59.110 --> 04:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
employer from litigation
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
so it really is the dispute may be that
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
the did the injury occur at work or was
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
it when uh
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
mountain biking on the weekend
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
or or there may be some other
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
other issues i i don't know i'd be
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
curious to hear from course
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
deputy ogden and our own chair who's
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
very familiar with workers comp if there
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
really is such a problem
 
04:16:21.750 --> 04:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i think we've talked
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
about this issue before with trying to
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
incentivize prompt payment
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
and it may be that you know the raising
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
the interest rate could be better but
 
04:16:31.110 --> 04:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
can you tell me i know you've also
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned that new hampshire has a lot
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
of going for it except for the very low
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
taxes do you own the home
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
04:16:38.720 --> 04:16:40.830 align:start position:0%
yes i do
thank

04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm aware that the property taxes
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
are going way up on the seacoast
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
right now but it's still an overall low
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
tax burden
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
without a medival
 
04:16:57.670 --> 04:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm so uh thank you mr chairman
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative abramson for
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
testifying i'm afraid i didn't hear i
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't think i correctly heard your
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
response to uh representative sullivan's
 
04:17:06.960 --> 04:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
response to uh representative sullivan's
question

04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that the intention
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill is
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
a claim is
 
04:17:17.760 --> 04:17:19.030 align:start position:0%
a claim is
submitted

04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
04:17:19.040 --> 04:17:20.229 align:start position:0%
submitted
and

04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:20.239 --> 04:17:21.030 align:start position:0%
and
is

04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the subject of some dispute
 
04:17:26.229 --> 04:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately it's agreed or
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
determined that it should be paid
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
is is it the at the 100 percent or at a
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
60 percent post some point in time
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a good question it's
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's the the part of the claim that's
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
denied and not paid and is just dragged
 
04:17:45.920 --> 04:17:46.790 align:start position:0%
denied and not paid and is just dragged
out

04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
something that's a 60-day delay usually
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
goes on for a lot longer than it's
 
04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
usually you know several months before
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
you actually get payment
 
04:17:55.110 --> 04:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
but once the company starts making the
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
payment if they're making payments on
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
time after that six months from now that
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
that amount should be paid at 60 percent
 
04:18:03.680 --> 04:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
that amount should be paid at 60 percent
but

04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
if it's just like any other payment if
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
you're making your your car payment or
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
or your credit card payment or payment
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
on medical bills or what have you if
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
you're late
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
the amount that you're late is what what
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um yes thanks for
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying that um and i assume of
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
course that
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
i should read this to discuss
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
payments as
 
04:18:32.159 --> 04:18:33.269 align:start position:0%
payments as
those

04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the carrier
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
are determined to be obligated to pay or
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
agree to pay
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
i mean this doesn't create some kind of
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
no fault no fault where
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the passage of time
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
payments become due is that a correct
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
statement correct okay uh my my intent
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
was that this wouldn't cost employers
 
04:18:54.080 --> 04:18:55.030 align:start position:0%
was that this wouldn't cost employers
anything

04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
it would just
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
you would know that your carrier would
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
start you know getting a little bit more
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
responsive thank you
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think i'm going to beat mr avilani
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
to this um
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
what would there be a cost to this that
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
might be passed on to the
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
people that insured businesses if the
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
carriers have to pay more wouldn't they
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
likely wouldn't this transfer to higher
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
rates for everyone who pays workers comp
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think so and the the reason
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
is right now um in business to business
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
payments if there's a if there's a
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
penalty structure built in businesses
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
just pay on time
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
the unlikely event
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
would be that a company has to borrow
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
money to pay six months sooner you know
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
in order to pay on time and the the
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
interest rate that businesses are paying
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
if they're paying six months sooner the
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
interest rate on on six months is not
 
04:19:51.199 --> 04:19:52.070 align:start position:0%
interest rate on on six months is not
um

04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
a very large amount of money might my
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
expectation is my experience has been
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
that with the complaints that i've
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
gotten from people is just that the the
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
carrier is
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
taking a long time to just process
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork that they're sitting on a case
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time for whatever
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
reason that they would just move quicker
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
if there were a penalty
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
a higher interest rate if for for kind
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
of dilly-dallying that they would they
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
would move a little bit quicker i don't
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
think it'd be an increase in cost
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
when i saw this thank you for taking my
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman
 
04:20:29.680 --> 04:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman
um

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
when i saw this bill it reminded me of
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
a bill that we saw a few years ago
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
um from a
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative from lancaster i believe
 
04:20:41.760 --> 04:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
representative from lancaster i believe
and

04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
it was based on his own personal
 
04:20:47.110 --> 04:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
experience and i think
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
when i saw a late payment
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
it brought me back back to his issue and
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
i believe his issue was
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that were just
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
really lousy at getting their payments
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
out so he was dealing with a late
 
04:21:04.800 --> 04:21:06.389 align:start position:0%
out so he was dealing with a late
payment

04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
once it was approved and it just wasn't
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
getting his money
 
04:21:09.520 --> 04:21:10.790 align:start position:0%
getting his money
um

04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:10.800 --> 04:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
um
if

04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
it seems that this bill would apply to
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
that but only if a company was actually
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
delaying payments by up to 60 days is
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
if the payment were made within 60 days
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any penalty under this
 
04:21:26.640 --> 04:21:28.389 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any penalty under this
bill

04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
and and it is
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
what i have seen is that some
 
04:21:35.110 --> 04:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
some insurance companies they should not
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
be in the insurance business
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
they might be in the insurance business
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
because they're actually an investment
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
firm and they found that they can bring
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
in some revenue
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
from uh insurance
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
the benefit of insurance is that
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
something unexpected happens with a car
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
collision or life insurance or claim or
 
04:21:51.920 --> 04:21:52.790 align:start position:0%
collision or life insurance or claim or
something

04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
of that sort the insurance company is
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay right away
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it might be very large unexpected
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
cost something that's completely random
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
for someone to be in the insurance
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
business they really need to pay out
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
claims quickly process them quickly and
 
04:22:08.950 --> 04:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
pay them quickly and some companies are
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
as i recollected it it was an issue such
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
as that but
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
these companies just weren't weren't
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
accustomed to actually doing something
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
similar to payroll
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're continually
 
04:22:25.840 --> 04:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
we're continually
um

04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:27.990 --> 04:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
slipping up with getting the payments
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
out on time
 
04:22:30.000 --> 04:22:31.349 align:start position:0%
out on time
in

04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
in memory of the uh representative from
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
lancaster it would be nice if we could
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
address that as well but that's uh
 
04:22:41.189 --> 04:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.349 --> 04:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely i would agree with that
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
cena thank you very much for your
 
04:22:49.920 --> 04:22:51.429 align:start position:0%
cena thank you very much for your
testimony

04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner rudy ogden from the
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman of rudy ogden deputy
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner department of labor as
 
04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative abramson mentioned we
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
just did speak briefly the department
 
04:23:17.670 --> 04:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
relative to this bill and not to rehash
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
old things that have uh come up in in
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
your folks questions but we did have
 
04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
some technical questions namely related
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
to this issue as presently
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
drafted for payments made to an employee
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
more than 60 days after the injury is
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
first reported
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
i do think that it's worth figuring out
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
where exactly you want to tether that to
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
you could very well have an injury
 
04:23:38.080 --> 04:23:39.429 align:start position:0%
you could very well have an injury
reported

04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
reported
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
and not have an order for payment or
 
04:23:41.920 --> 04:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
and not have an order for payment or
anything

04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that the carrier or the
 
04:23:47.349 --> 04:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
employer is responsible for anything
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
until well after 60 days have passed and
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
that is not always a matter of people
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
dragging their feet or not doing what
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing it could be
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
that you have an injury
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
you report that injury you don't end up
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
getting treatment until 90 days later
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
you don't have a medical bill you don't
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
have any missed time so i just want to
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
point out that in terms of if we're
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
talking about late payments late
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
payments is somewhat different than just
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
saying 60 days after an injury is first
 
04:24:14.399 --> 04:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
saying 60 days after an injury is first
reported

04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
reported
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing we had as a question for
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of technical consideration
 
04:24:22.389 --> 04:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
is where it says if an employee's
 
04:24:25.110 --> 04:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage is more than 30 of
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
the state's average weekly wage weekly
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
compensation shall be and then it goes
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
on we would just want to be clear that
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know is this intended to not provide
 
04:24:35.670 --> 04:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
this premium payment or enhanced payment
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
to those individuals making less than 30
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
of the average weekly wage so again one
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
way of structuring this to the extent
 
04:24:42.479 --> 04:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
way of structuring this to the extent
you're

04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
looking to do this type of
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
notion would be to just say everybody is
 
04:24:50.790 --> 04:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
going to get this enhanced
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
payment upon late late pay
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i would point out
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
just in terms of generalized information
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of like this general
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
discontent of you know workers all over
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
not liking new hampshire other than
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
we do oftentimes hear about folks don't
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
like the fact that our indemnity rate is
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
60 of their average weekly wage i
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand there's a lot of there's
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
policy to that i understand there was a
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
compromise made in terms of why it's not
 
04:25:17.680 --> 04:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
compromise made in terms of why it's not
66

04:25:19.110 --> 04:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
66
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
but i just point out that that is
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
something we hear as a generalized
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
complaint about workers comp
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the other thing that we
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
hear about in terms of complaints in
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
this context is as
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
under existing law the department is
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
entitled if you have a carrier that is
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
flagrantly late representative
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
sullivan brought up this notion we have
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with carriers before who have had
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
a history or bad practice or pattern
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
they can be fined but that fine goes to
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
the department and there have been
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
complaints from individual or affected
 
04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
workers saying
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the worker the payments were late to
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
me yes you find them and maybe that's a
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
deterrent going forward but the fine
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't you you recovering that fine
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't help me for my lap my uh
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
inconveniences or added costs or
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
expenses that i've incurred so that
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
again i just point that out not out of
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
any sense of defensiveness but just two
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
instances in which the department has
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard of concerns in this area the only
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
other thing i would point out because
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
you folks often ask
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
are we aware of yes there are issues
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
where carriers pay late uh we do have
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
incentives where the check is supposed
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
to be there on a friday and the person
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get it to a monday when we are
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
made aware of those instances we go
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
after you know the carrier it's not
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
always a fine we're not issuing a fine
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
every single time
 
04:26:41.110 --> 04:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
but we are trying to work to get those
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
corrected but that does come up i do
 
04:26:46.229 --> 04:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
think direct deposit has cured or
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
alleviated some of these concerns
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
not everyone though elects to do direct
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
deposit additionally when folks do
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
direct deposit sometimes there's a lag
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
in setting that up where it you know
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
they set up the direct deposit and then
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
it takes some time to set in so i'm
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but just
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide that additional
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
context and as representative abramson
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
said um we did have some technical
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions if the parties want to move
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
forward with this we're willing to and
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
happy to try and help in any way in
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the language
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner could you explain to
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:27:23.429 --> 04:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
procedure is
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
now in a scenario where an
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
injured employee
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
is unhappy
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
handling of a workers compensation claim
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
so most often times if they're unhappy
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
with something if they have on their own
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
they would call
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
unhappy in the sense of how the claim
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
has been handled um if they're not
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
getting their check if they're not
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing back from the adjuster this is
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the claim
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh they're not the employer hasn't
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
provided the information on payroll all
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
usually the first two weeks
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the issue
 
04:28:04.469 --> 04:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
getting these things started so
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
i know what the procedure is in place
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
but i'd like you to tell everyone
 
04:28:11.110 --> 04:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
when that person contacts us what
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
contacts us whether it is in writing or
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
over the phone they're put in touch with
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of different people in our
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
office who then would go and say okay
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
what do we have on file procedurally or
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
process wise where is this case or claim
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
at and then what that person does is
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
they then go reach out to if there is a
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
carrier assume there is a carrier
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're reaching out to the carrier and
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
saying okay where are we at on this
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to you know push and
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
what we're ultimately trying to do
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
is we do understand this idea of feet
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
dragging needing bills to get paid if
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's a dispute if the parties are
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
actually into a ripened dispute if
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
someone asks for a hearing by law
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to get a hearing within
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
six weeks now certainly the parties will
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
say oh i want to continue this or we're
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
willing to continue it we'd be looking
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
for both sides willing to continue it
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
but i just want to what our efforts are
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to your point if
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
someone's unsatisfied or they think
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
something's not happening we try and
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
talk to the parties get the parties to
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
make and get everything in the file what
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
needs to happen then we try and say is
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
there a dispute does someone want to ask
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
for a hearing or is this something that
 
04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
can be worked out or taken care of
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
if it can't be worked out and taken care
 
04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
of then it's like okay somebody asked
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
for a hearing and then we're trying to
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
push it okay within sex six weeks let's
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
get a hearing scheduled so folks can
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
dispute that issue
 
04:29:30.870 --> 04:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you a few
 
04:29:32.950 --> 04:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
years ago you had a workers comp
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
carrier that was notorious
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
my word not yours
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
for late payments
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
i know the department addressed that but
 
04:29:44.830 --> 04:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
04:29:47.110 --> 04:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
fine uh
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you have the ability to
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
bring forth upon an insurance carrier
 
04:29:52.880 --> 04:29:54.229 align:start position:0%
bring forth upon an insurance carrier
for

04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
late payments
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
so 408 payment as was mentioned by the
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor we could find up to 2500 dollars
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
for that in incident so
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh if they're late every week you know
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
you could find them per incident saying
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know you've been late on that
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
payment i will say in addition to fining
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
typically what we try and do
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
is ask for a meeting with the carrier
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
and they've been in the situation where
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
the carrier will send certain of their
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
adjusters in or certain of their
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
manager's ways is it just people being
 
04:30:25.279 --> 04:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
manager's ways is it just people being
relaxed

04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
those that are late some are better than
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
others but we've usually been able to
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
work through them and at least get them
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
when we're aware of an issue on some
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
type of track going forward
 
04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cahill
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner uh how do we define
 
04:30:49.439 --> 04:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner uh how do we define
late

04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
late
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the payments when they're due
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
or the
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
speed of the
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
claim being evaluated and just and
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
determined what are there some
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
rules there yeah so in the most basic
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
sense if there's an order for payment
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
there will be an order for payment in
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
which it'll say pay within x if it's an
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
indemnity payment similar to almost a
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
payroll it's supposed to be set up with
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay this payment is going to happen
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know and it'll be on friday and then
 
04:31:21.990 --> 04:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
every you know there is a set schedule
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the carrier is aware of that
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
schedule either through an order or
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
through an arrangement between the you
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
know okay indemnity payments are going
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
to start they'll kick in and they should
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
be sequential after that follow up
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
so how long generally between the injury
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the payment start
 
04:31:41.830 --> 04:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
is there a standard for that or that's a
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
really good question i think i'd want to
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
get additional information for that
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
because again some of these cases
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's no dispute at all they're
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
accepted they start moving and payment
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
could happen right away to the sponsor's
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
point there are certainly incidents in
 
04:31:54.880 --> 04:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
point there are certainly incidents in
which

04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know the employees waiting to see is
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the claim going to be accepted but
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
there's only 21 days to accept or deny
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
but sometimes what happens
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
is if there's an initial denial
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
oh we denied it because we need more
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
information please employees supply more
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
information and then sometimes the
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
employee takes some time to gather it
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
because to the sponsors point if they
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney and not everyone
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
should need an attorney but if they
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney sometimes it
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
takes the employee some time to gather
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
that information put together what they
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
think is
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
what's needed and get there so there can
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
be delays so i have a hard time
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
apologies answering what would be an
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
average case i can certainly ask folks
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the department i think i could get a
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
more credible answer than i can convey
 
04:32:41.110 --> 04:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
right now one more follow-up follow-up
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh might there be
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
delays in getting information from the
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
medical community that's treating the
 
04:32:47.199 --> 04:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
medical community that's treating the
patient

04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
yes i would say that uh there are many
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
instances in which uh the parties are
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
the the medical record you know that
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay did the person see a treating
 
04:32:59.120 --> 04:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
okay did the person see a treating
physician

04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
physician
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
has that made it where it needs to be do
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have sufficient medicals to make a
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
determination or move
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the question
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
i have a few additional
 
04:33:17.520 --> 04:33:18.949 align:start position:0%
i have a few additional
approximately

04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:33:18.959 --> 04:33:20.629 align:start position:0%
approximately
uh

04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
ballpark it no one's gonna hold you to
 
04:33:22.639 --> 04:33:23.349 align:start position:0%
ballpark it no one's gonna hold you to
it

04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
approximately how many complaints do you
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
think a month you receive for late
 
04:33:27.199 --> 04:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
think a month you receive for late
payments

04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
payments
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
for late payments um
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
and i'm not talking about the ones that
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
friday to monday that you know or what
 
04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
have you although i know that's still an
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
issue that you're trying to resolve and
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
the um direct deposit has helped that
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm talking about someone that's a
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
week late two weeks late
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
things like that with
 
04:33:46.320 --> 04:33:47.670 align:start position:0%
things like that with
significant

04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
um issues with the carrier
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
a handful of times a month and when i
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
say a handful i'm probably saying a
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
10 or less
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
i would say on average that's the amount
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
now that might be happening a lot more
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
than that but i'm saying incidents of
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
people actually calling in and saying
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh payments late needs i need help i
 
04:34:09.510 --> 04:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
10 or a lot 10 or less a month one final
 
04:34:12.719 --> 04:34:15.189 align:start position:0%
10 or a lot 10 or less a month one final
question

04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
which you may not want to answer
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
do you feel the fine is appropriate or
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
i would say the fines appropriate in the
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
sense of if we
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to issue a 2500 penalty for every
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
late incident i actually think that you
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
would see deterrence
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
in there and it's probably something i
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to say out loud but i do
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
understand this idea of
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
folks being frustrated that they're not
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
getting the money so
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
again a penalty from us i see as a
 
04:34:46.320 --> 04:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
again a penalty from us i see as a
deterrent

04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
deterrent
 
04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
but the fact that that penalty in no way
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh is then attributed or provided to the
 
04:34:52.480 --> 04:34:53.269 align:start position:0%
uh is then attributed or provided to the
uh

04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
the injured claimant i see as is
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat problematic but again that's a
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
policy decision
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
i have to keep looking representative
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
mandeville because i'm not used to
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
saying your name so i want to make sure
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
i have it right that's why every time
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
you put your finger up i'm looking to
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm saying it right represent
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
medical you're recognized thank you mr
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you uh deputy
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
ogden um
 
04:35:16.959 --> 04:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
ogden um
but

04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
particular to this this proposed bill
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
in light of your testimony about
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
date the injury is first reported
 
04:35:28.400 --> 04:35:29.189 align:start position:0%
date the injury is first reported
would

04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
you either feel more comfortable if the
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
time that the trigger
 
04:35:34.240 --> 04:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
time that the trigger
was

04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
some period of time say 45 days
 
04:35:38.719 --> 04:35:39.990 align:start position:0%
some period of time say 45 days
following

04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
following
 
04:35:40.000 --> 04:35:41.109 align:start position:0%
following
a

04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
timely determination
 
04:35:44.480 --> 04:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
timely determination
or

04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
some other means of
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
establishing a proper time frame that
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
takes into account
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
what the carrier has to do to
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
deal with or adjust the claim
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i think that's
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
a great question to be clear
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
when we initially the department saw
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
this bill we were considering it more
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
akin to representative sullivan's point
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
as a late payment bill
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
when i thought it was a late payment
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill i would say certainly we'd feel it
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
more clear and comfortable if it was
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
saying payment after a date where
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
there's an order due or something like
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
that to be fair to the sponsor if the
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor's point is to say no i want to
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
accelerate the entire system
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
this would accelerate the entire system
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
but i do think you're then running into
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
those issues where
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
payment was never ordered the carrier
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
never knew there was going to be payment
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
ordered and now it's past 60 days so
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
again i think that's something has to be
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
follow mr chairman
 
04:36:41.600 --> 04:36:42.949 align:start position:0%
follow mr chairman
um

04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:42.959 --> 04:36:43.830 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's why i said timely determination
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh because it could be a denial or an
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
approval um and if it were
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
an approval then you're dealing with
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan's situation if
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's a denial
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
then you're at a point in time where
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
it either was or was not denied properly
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the chips fall where they do but
 
04:37:09.920 --> 04:37:10.629 align:start position:0%
and the chips fall where they do but
would

04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
would that deal with both
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
concerns while also allowing the carrier
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it could i i think that some
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
um of up to 2 500
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
are you able to also make a
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
determination of restitution to
 
04:37:46.561 --> 04:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
determination of restitution to
the

04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:47.359 --> 04:37:48.551 align:start position:0%
the
employee

04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
if they were had a late payment or
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
considerably payments or they've had or
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's gone beyond any reasonable amount
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
of time
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
can the department of labor order that
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
back this and plus interest plus
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
fees or something like that do you guys
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that no so
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
presently what there is is the ability
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
for a penalty paid to the department and
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for interest on
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
a payment to the claimant so that that
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
could happen interest on a late payment
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh but you would have no extraordinary
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
payment or restitution to the claimant
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.160 --> 04:38:26.869 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
is there uh is there a statutory uh
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
interest rate is it one percent a month
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
is it is there anything in statute it
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
tracks to the same rate and if you look
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
actually on the text here of the
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
proposed bill it does track we're using
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
the same rate as judgments as under uh
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
336-1 so it's the statutory or the court
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
prescribed rate of judgment on awards
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%

uh which is a trade association of
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
companies that were
 
04:39:52.150 --> 04:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
primarily are primarily organized under
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
the laws of new hampshire although
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
currently it includes companies that are
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
chartered outside of new hampshire but
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
doing business here
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%

association
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
which is a large
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
national trade association

and other coverage in new hampshire so
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
we represent
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
not all but i think most of the workers
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
compensation that's written in in new
 
04:40:21.760 --> 04:40:23.350 align:start position:0%
compensation that's written in in new
hampshire

04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the discussion that's taken
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
place on this bill and the questions
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
that have been asked
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
many of them are questions that we have
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
about how to interpret uh the bill uh if
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're applying i think that
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
i won't belabor that because i think
 
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's clear
 
04:40:39.440 --> 04:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
it's clear
that

04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:42.550 --> 04:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
if you are going to do something by way
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
of remedy
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
the bill needs needs a significant
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
it it is subject to a lot of
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation i think my clients were
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
mostly concerned that
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
where there are legitimate issues why it
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
takes longer to make a determination
 
04:41:06.310 --> 04:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
than 60 days it would be an obligation
 
04:41:06.320 --> 04:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
than 60 days it would be an obligation
retroactively

04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
the increased amount of compensation
 
04:41:11.520 --> 04:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
the increased amount of compensation
also

04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
it is i i think unclear under the bill
 
04:41:16.000 --> 04:41:16.948 align:start position:0%
it is i i think unclear under the bill
whether

04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh once an order
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
once someone is
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
found to be obligated to
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
pay the enhanced compensation how long
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
does that go on
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's all been been covered
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
here pretty well
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
i i won't say any more about that but i
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
would like to mention the
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
existing law uh and the provisions
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
for requiring uh timely payment that
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
exist currently in the law because i
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
think that what we're talking about here
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
is if anything it's an enforcement issue
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
and not not a question of
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh requiring a payment because timely
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
payment is already required
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that requirement is contained in
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
several places one is
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the section that
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
this bill amends which is
 
04:42:08.798 --> 04:42:10.948 align:start position:0%
this bill amends which is
um

04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
rsa for 281 a 42
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill as you see adds a paragraph
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
five but
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs one through four
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
state what the
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
obligation for payment is
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
under the law today
 
04:42:27.920 --> 04:42:29.190 align:start position:0%
under the law today
and

04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
the penalties for not making timely
 
04:42:32.080 --> 04:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
the penalties for not making timely
payment

04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
as the deputy commissioner mentioned
 
04:42:36.480 --> 04:42:37.590 align:start position:0%
as the deputy commissioner mentioned
the

04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the authority to assess
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
a civil penalty of up to 2 500
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
on any carrier self-insurer that fails
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
without sufficient cause
 
04:42:47.840 --> 04:42:48.868 align:start position:0%
without sufficient cause
to

04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
pay or deny a claim within 20 days 21
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
that 2500
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
is has been applied
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
to b every payment is additional 2500 so
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
you can add up to a pretty significant
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
number if if there's an ongoing failure
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
to make to make payment
 
04:43:13.760 --> 04:43:15.110 align:start position:0%
to make to make payment
um

04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:15.120 --> 04:43:16.310 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:18.550 --> 04:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
further requirement in that section is
 
04:43:18.560 --> 04:43:19.750 align:start position:0%
further requirement in that section is
that

04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
upon failure of any carrier self-insurer
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
to comply
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
with an order for payment of
 
04:43:26.240 --> 04:43:27.830 align:start position:0%
with an order for payment of
compensation

04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
recover either
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
the civil penalty or the additional
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
compensation both in a civil action in
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
the superior court or in a civil action
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the superior court
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
power and obligation exists currently in
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%

04:43:47.760 --> 04:43:49.270 align:start position:0%

04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280 align:start position:0%

04:43:49.280 --> 04:43:50.230 align:start position:0%

04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%

insurance commissioner
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
the record of an insurance carrier who
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
consistently fails to comply with the

provisions of this section
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
if the insurance commissioner should
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
upon investigation
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
find the carrier to be in substantial
 
04:44:21.360 --> 04:44:22.788 align:start position:0%
find the carrier to be in substantial
non-compliance

04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall order compliance
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%

04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall fail to comply
 
04:44:29.120 --> 04:44:30.708 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall fail to comply
insurance

04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
the carrier shall fail to comply
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner shall suspend
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
or revoke such carriers authorization
 
04:44:40.230 --> 04:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
to carry out the business
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
workers compensation in this state
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty strong power and a
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
pretty strong a penalty that would be
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
imposed the very
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
lifeblood of a company its ability to do
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
04:44:51.840 --> 04:44:52.868 align:start position:0%
business in the state
um

04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
and and i think
 
04:44:54.400 --> 04:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
and and i think
that

04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
this power knowing the insurance
 
04:44:57.680 --> 04:44:58.788 align:start position:0%
this power knowing the insurance
department

04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
would be uh exercised if the department
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
were made aware of violations because no
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
one wants
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
my clients or anyone wants a company to
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
do business in this state that is
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
willfully delaying
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh payments made to
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh an injured and injured worker that
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
just doesn't that just doesn't fit uh
 
04:45:20.638 --> 04:45:21.430 align:start position:0%
just doesn't that just doesn't fit uh
any

04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
profile of what a company should should
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think we're mostly talking about
 
04:45:26.320 --> 04:45:27.910 align:start position:0%
i think we're mostly talking about
inadvertent

04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
failures to make timely payment and
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
these are going to occur from time to
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
time pattern of failure then i think
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh subject and i think the law already
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
provides for it
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the the harshest
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh of of penalties people the companies
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
don't belong in new hampshire if they're
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
doing this and i am mindful
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
my memory is a little vague but i
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
remember a few years ago that there was
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
a carrier that was arguably uh
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
engaging in that conduct and again if
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
memory serves i think that the
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
they were called to task pretty
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
seriously and that the uh there was
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
again if i recall correctly
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
a hefty fine and that the the actions of
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
its conduct was uh was addressed
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
by the by the department of labor so i
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
think the tools exist right now i should
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
mention too that under the insurance
 
04:46:28.480 --> 04:46:29.350 align:start position:0%
mention too that under the insurance
laws

04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
which apply to workers compensation
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's an unfair trade practices act
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
that applies to claims and among those
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
requirements is
 
04:46:40.708 --> 04:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that payments be made
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
promptly claims payment that's rsa 417
 
04:46:45.990 --> 04:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:46:46.000 --> 04:46:46.830 align:start position:0%
and that
uh

04:46:46.830 --> 04:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
statute is supplemented by rule 1000 of
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
the insurance department which goes into
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
detail about a timely payment of claims
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
and that that would apply
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
to workers compensation claims payments
 
04:47:04.350 --> 04:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
also there is uh labor rule 500
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
50602 of which provides that a carrier
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
shell or employer shall pay all claims
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the rule goes on to
 
04:47:15.280 --> 04:47:17.510 align:start position:0%
and the rule goes on to
define

04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
define
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
the obligation and the penalties that
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
would apply in the event of
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so i think what we have
 
04:47:23.040 --> 04:47:23.910 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so i think what we have
here

04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:47:23.920 --> 04:47:24.788 align:start position:0%
here
is

04:47:24.788 --> 04:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
an issue not of
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the statute but of
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement of uh what already exists in
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
the law and
 
04:47:34.958 --> 04:47:36.788 align:start position:0%
the law and
um

04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's hard from based on the testimony to
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
at least for me to get a handle on how
 
04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
extensive the
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is but even if there are 10
 
04:47:50.320 --> 04:47:51.350 align:start position:0%
the problem is but even if there are 10
complaints

04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
at any given time there shouldn't be
 
04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:47:55.360 --> 04:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
and uh
so

04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with the department
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
uh and if what is called for is a
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
reminder to carriers of their obligation
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to participate in that
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh
 
04:48:09.680 --> 04:48:10.788 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh
the

04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
department of labor is
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
get that reminder out to uh carriers and
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the department of
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
insurance but i think that they too who
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
regulate the licenses of insurance
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
companies including workers comp
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies in this state
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh might and they've done this sort of
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
thing in the past
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
either by bulletin or some notice to all
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
carriers doing business in the state
 
04:48:36.798 --> 04:48:37.590 align:start position:0%
carriers doing business in the state
uh

04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh emphasize the importance of timely
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
payments of workers compensation i just
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
suggest that as one possible way to
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
approach the issue before we
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
talk about making statutory changes that
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
like anything else have
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences the
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
again i won't be labor but the
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
this will certainly increase costs if
 
04:49:00.000 --> 04:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
this will certainly increase costs if
uh

04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
for one thing if if if if an employee is
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to receive 100 of
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
his or her wage
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh i mean 60 100 percent versus 60
 
04:49:12.638 --> 04:49:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh i mean 60 100 percent versus 60
tax-free

04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
tax-free
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive not to go back uh
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
to work so that's one reason that
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
that there is a reduction from 100 in
 
04:49:24.798 --> 04:49:25.750 align:start position:0%
that there is a reduction from 100 in
what

04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
is received under disability policies
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
privately or under workers compensation
 
04:49:30.878 --> 04:49:32.070 align:start position:0%
privately or under workers compensation
also

04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
again depending on how this bill is
 
04:49:33.760 --> 04:49:34.550 align:start position:0%
again depending on how this bill is
written

04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
it would have a chilling effect on
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the denial of claims that should
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
be denied by an insurance company
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
because of the exposure if they're later
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
found to have an obligation to have
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
provided coverage
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
and if
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
this hundred percent penalty is going to
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
be retroactive to
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh sometime in the past
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
when the
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
the matter should have been
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh should have been accepted so i'll
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
leave it i'll leave it at that but i
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
think these are a couple of examples
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
where maybe
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
the remedy could be
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
looked at a little bit
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
more before you decide whether to enact
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislation in this area thank you mr
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr ruthless
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony has been very helpful uh
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a few things i didn't know i
 
04:50:28.628 --> 04:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
know the chairman of course knew all of
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't know about the insurance
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
department's having that other
 
04:50:33.680 --> 04:50:34.390 align:start position:0%
department's having that other
uh

04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:35.830 --> 04:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
hand in this so
 
04:50:35.840 --> 04:50:36.948 align:start position:0%
hand in this so
um

04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
disruption for the customers of that
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
insurance people with their work not
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
long no longer offering the plan in the
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
state and all of a sudden they're
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
they had no workers comp but could you
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
i think these the sponsor's main issue
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
here was the
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary payment and the delay the
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
delay in that do you have any
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
information on how long it generally
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
takes to process a claim or
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
how how bad a problem this this is from
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
your perspective
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i i um
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to defer to the labor
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
department uh to to answer that i think
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
they'd have a much better account
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
well i don't i think it's fair to say
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
that that these problems are
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
are not the the rule but the exception
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
and that most most cases are
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh clearly um
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh work-related uh accidents or injuries
 
04:51:39.430 --> 04:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
and and and they're paid and as the
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
system's designed to do without lawyers
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
or controversy to to just in a no-fault
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
system to have uh have the payment
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
made and timely made but in terms of uh
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
statistics i think the department would
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
because they'll get a first report of
 
04:51:56.708 --> 04:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
injury from the employee and then the uh
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the report from the employer or the
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
carrier and uh so
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh they may have actual records that
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
would that would be uh helpful in
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
answering your question well the deputy
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
ogden did say roughly roughly perhaps 10
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
a month
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
but perhaps perhaps there's other
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
detailed reports we could get and see
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
just the ones that don't get a complaint
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
how often how long it takes yes
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i thank you and
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
i i will ask mr chairman i i will ask uh
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
carriers um the first reaction that i
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
got in talking with carriers is they
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
they were not aware of a problem but
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know fully answer the question and i
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
i will check back based on the testimony
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor and the department and uh
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
see if i can learn anything more that's
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
helpful but thank you very much thank
 
04:52:43.680 --> 04:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
helpful but thank you very much thank
you

04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
any other question mr russos whoever
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
does mandeville you're
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing i'm sorry brian you do
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
mandeville and representative seaworth
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman the uh unfair
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
claims practices or trade practices acts
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
in this state to which you referred do
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
they contain any kind of trouble damages
 
04:53:05.830 --> 04:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
or other remuneration for a successful
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh claimant
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
there is uh thank you
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is a private right of action
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh that exists under that statute um
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh it i believe
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
is not does not provide enhanced damages
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it provides for attorneys
 
04:53:28.390 --> 04:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
fees and uh in fairness i should say
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
that that's very very seldom uh used but
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
to answer your question it is in the law
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to a violation of
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
of that statute uh especially on a
 
04:53:39.990 --> 04:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
finding by the commissioner
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the statute has been violated i
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
think it's crime of facial evidence in a
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
civil action uh that there's been a
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
violation followed mr chairman
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and not only attorney's fees but
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
compensatory damages presumably would be
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
included thank you
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding you are correct
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
there are no trouble damages when it
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.080 --> 04:54:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
04:54:09.270 --> 04:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
russos for your input i'd like to
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
clarify something i think i heard you
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
already speak to
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
attach the bill we have the department
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
of labor is unsure
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
whether this will increase premiums for
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
state county local government
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor actually said he didn't
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
think there would be any increase in
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
cost but i think i heard you say it will
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely be an increase in cost
 
04:54:32.878 --> 04:54:35.270 align:start position:0%
absolutely be an increase in cost
specifically

04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to quantify this first state
 
04:54:42.750 --> 04:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not an actuary or anything but uh i
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
i think it would be hard to conceive of
 
04:54:48.878 --> 04:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
i think it would be hard to conceive of
uh

04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
anything other than an increase in costs
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
if if you're paying in in whatever
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
number of cases 100 of a wage rather
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
than 60 percent of a wage for some
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
indeterminate period of time
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh at the state and local and county
 
04:55:03.600 --> 04:55:04.868 align:start position:0%
uh at the state and local and county
level

04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
that that would increase
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
costs i also think that
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
that the chilling effect that this would
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
have depending on how the bill is read
 
04:55:13.200 --> 04:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
have depending on how the bill is read
on

04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ability of a company to deny claims
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
their right and obligation on behalf of
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
the employer to deny a claim that they
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't think is compensable
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
but sometimes they're going to be held
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be have been mistaken and if you go
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
back retroactively it's it's it's a it's
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
a big amount potentially that they would
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
be exposed to and they're going to think
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
about that before they uh decide whether
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
to contest a claim or not and
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
so that's another policy question i
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
think if if
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
there is a serious interest
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
as you know ncci is the
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
real authority on uh
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
with its actuaries on the effects of
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
legislation on on
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
on the cost of insurance lost costs of
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
insurance and
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh you you might consult with them
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
but my sort of
 
04:56:04.080 --> 04:56:05.030 align:start position:0%
but my sort of
uh

04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:05.040 --> 04:56:06.868 align:start position:0%
uh
layman's

04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
layman's
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
view of it is that i think it would
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
certainly increase costs
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%

05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
my intent is to allow
 
05:01:45.200 --> 05:01:46.390 align:start position:0%
my intent is to allow
applicants

05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
or candidates who apply for any public
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
service position including fire ems
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
police nursing or other public service
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
positions and are required to take a
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
background or submit to a background
 
05:01:59.280 --> 05:02:00.788 align:start position:0%
background or submit to a background
investigation

05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:02:00.798 --> 05:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
investigation
to

05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
be able to attain a copy of the said
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
background report
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
upon completion
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
the current practice of most
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
public employees will not allow that
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
speaking with some police administer
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason why they do not release that
 
05:02:18.400 --> 05:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
reason why they do not release that
information

05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
it falls under rsa five fleet standards
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
and training does have a class on it
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
that is a guideline but not a standard
 
05:02:32.550 --> 05:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
so each individual agencies can develop
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
their own standards on how they do
 
05:02:36.550 --> 05:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
background investigations
 
05:02:36.560 --> 05:02:38.788 align:start position:0%
background investigations
okay

05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
the information that is in the
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
background investigation pertains to
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
the candidate or applicant himself or
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
herself and should be entitled to that
 
05:02:49.440 --> 05:02:52.150 align:start position:0%
herself and should be entitled to that
um

05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
some of the information that has been
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
released you know i would like to see
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody's doing a background on a
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
public servant and they contact their
 
05:03:00.080 --> 05:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
public servant and they contact their
employer

05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
that it's in the personnel file
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
what i have come to seen in some
 
05:03:06.080 --> 05:03:07.590 align:start position:0%
what i have come to seen in some
agencies

05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:03:07.600 --> 05:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
agencies
that

05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
administrators actually keep a secret
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
file that
 
05:03:16.550 --> 05:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
the employee has no
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge of and they present that
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
to a background investigator or
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
the powder hearsay
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
is another thing i do not feel hearsay
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
should be part of a background
 
05:03:29.120 --> 05:03:31.590 align:start position:0%
should be part of a background
investigation

05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's many examples i mean because
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
people can say whatever they want so
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be hearsay use i
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
think it should have to be
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
something that they can provide hard
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
evidence or documentation for an example
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
if all of a sudden a
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
police officer um
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know goes for a
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
job in an
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
excuse in the background investigation
 
05:03:57.360 --> 05:03:58.230 align:start position:0%
excuse in the background investigation
a

05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
administrator or somebody that has
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
spoken to says hey just so you know this
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
officer has received a write-up for this
 
05:04:06.000 --> 05:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
officer has received a write-up for this
behavior

05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay if that's in the
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
personnel file then i understand that
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
can be used but if that is incorrect and
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's no documentation of that that
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
because false information can be
 
05:04:25.200 --> 05:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
because false information can be
portrayed

05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
portrayed
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so at this point for an
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
example two now one thing we've been
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with in the house is the
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes offices have been put on that
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
list without even knowing so
 
05:04:43.520 --> 05:04:44.470 align:start position:0%
list without even knowing so
and

05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
they go for a a position with another
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
agency or
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
another um public service job and that
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
comes up and they had no way of
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
defending themselves i know that's
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
something we're working on to correct
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
but this information pertains to the
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
candidate and they should have the right
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
i know there has been a recent case in
 
05:05:06.390 --> 05:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
the merrimack county
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
superior court over a matter like this
 
05:05:09.680 --> 05:05:10.868 align:start position:0%
superior court over a matter like this
and

05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
the argument was when the person asked
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
for the background investigation report
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
the argument was that under 5 16 39 that
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
was an internal investigation and that's
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
why it could not be released
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
the superior court judge ruled
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
differently and said that a candidate is
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
not a employee which is required under
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
the internal investigations
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
the judge said that just because you're
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
given a conditional offer that statute
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
does not apply and
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
mandated that it would be turned over to
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
the candidate
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
because it was information information
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
pertaining to themselves
 
05:05:50.718 --> 05:05:51.750 align:start position:0%
pertaining to themselves
then

05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
it was appealed to the supreme court and
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
the supreme court ruled
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
superior court judge
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
so at this time
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
um anybody in an administrative position
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
in fire service police
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh ems
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
will not release that information
 
05:06:18.878 --> 05:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
will not release that information
um

05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
again you're not asking for somebody
 
05:06:24.150 --> 05:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
else's information or anything like that
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's pertaining to yourself so you
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
should know what's being said
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
about you as a candidate so if it's
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
something you can correct
 
05:06:31.120 --> 05:06:32.070 align:start position:0%
something you can correct
um

05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
you correct it i mean it could be
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
the part of a
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
they do a credit report and you might
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
have a bad credit report
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
and you don't get the job or whatever
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
and you don't know that
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
and there's no way of correcting that
 
05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
it could be somebody went through a hard
 
05:06:49.750 --> 05:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
time went through a divorce something
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
happened it's something that could be
 
05:06:51.200 --> 05:06:52.868 align:start position:0%
happened it's something that could be
corrected

05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
so at this point that's why i'm asking
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you know we look at this bill
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
the other thing is in my bill is
 
05:07:11.670 --> 05:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:07:14.230 --> 05:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
being able to pass information from one
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
background investigator from one agency
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
to another one be prohibited
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
because there's no standard one
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
department can do it one way another
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
department can do with another
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
so they should not be able to pass
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
information on
 
05:07:29.200 --> 05:07:30.788 align:start position:0%
information on
because

05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
it could be false information and that
 
05:07:32.560 --> 05:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
it could be false information and that
could

05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
be defamation or harming to a person's
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that's basically the bill
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
basically so i'm asking this committee
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
to please consider this and you know
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
make it fair so
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
any candidate in the public service can
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
have a fair shot at future employment
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
and to correct issues
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony how many
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%

representative for bringing forward this
bill

05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:08:12.958 --> 05:08:14.310 align:start position:0%
bill
um

05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know if if this is a this is a
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and if there's
 
05:08:20.480 --> 05:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and if there's
nothing

05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
criminally that you that the officer or
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
firefighter has done
 
05:08:26.320 --> 05:08:27.190 align:start position:0%
firefighter has done
um

05:08:27.190 --> 05:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
why why does that turn up in their
 
05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
personnel file
 
05:08:30.638 --> 05:08:31.430 align:start position:0%
personnel file
um

05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
this is not a criminal it's a
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
pre-employment pre-employment ic thank
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
you for the qualification i mean more
 
05:08:38.550 --> 05:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
than likely if you are going for a
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
public service position you do sign a
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
waiver to get
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
a criminal record check done
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
but i mean if you are a
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
candidate in
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
something on your criminal record you
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
should know about that it's more
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
concerning when things are being said or
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
provided that the candidate has no idea
 
05:08:59.680 --> 05:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
provided that the candidate has no idea
about

05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:09:03.360 --> 05:09:04.628 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
is there also an issue where like maybe
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
your current employer doesn't know that
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking for another position and
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
you maybe you'd rather they didn't know
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
is this a little awkward to have someone
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
checking with your current employer no i
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.040 --> 05:09:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
fear retaliation if they don't get the
 
05:09:25.760 --> 05:09:26.788 align:start position:0%
fear retaliation if they don't get the
job

05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
usually you know it should be the part
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
that you're honest with them hey i'm
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
looking for another job or whatever and
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are administrators out there that
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
do get upset
 
05:09:39.270 --> 05:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and that's what i'm not looking at
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's when they provide
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
hearsay that they cannot back up
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
or they they say something happened to
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody and there's no proof of that
 
05:09:49.600 --> 05:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
somebody and there's no proof of that
like

05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
my example was if all of a sudden you
 
05:09:52.240 --> 05:09:53.270 align:start position:0%
my example was if all of a sudden you
know

05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
you're the chief and somebody comes in
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
and does a background in one of your
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
offices you have a personality conflict
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
you have um
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
or he's upset that you applied for
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
another job and then all of a sudden you
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
say hey you know what this guy
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
he was a problem he was always showing
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
calling out sick showing up late doing
 
05:10:09.360 --> 05:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
calling out sick showing up late doing
this

05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
well if it was a big problem why
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you do a write-up and have it
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
in his personnel file and let him know
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
but then all of a sudden you do that
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
when they go for another job you give
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
that information which might be false
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%

05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
on the first page
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have lines i do not have okay
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
second paragraph in this section
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
halfway down public employer shall mean
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
which will mean the state and public
 
05:11:13.920 --> 05:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
which will mean the state and public
subdivisions

05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that that was something
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
that when the bill was written
 
05:11:23.600 --> 05:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
that when the bill was written
um

05:11:24.550 --> 05:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
that was put in there
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm willing to amend that
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
i think legislative service is right
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
sided a lot um i have a few questions oh
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%

05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%

um thank you representative
 
05:11:44.958 --> 05:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative
for

05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:11:48.310 --> 05:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
testifying uh
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
obviously this this addresses the right
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
to have access to the um
 
05:11:56.550 --> 05:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
report but also contains
 
05:11:59.430 --> 05:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
the section starting it well our line 11
 
05:11:59.440 --> 05:12:00.390 align:start position:0%
the section starting it well our line 11
that that

05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
what the employer can use or won't use
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
and you've talked about hearsay
 
05:12:05.280 --> 05:12:06.070 align:start position:0%
and you've talked about hearsay
as

05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think being your prime
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
focus of what an employer shouldn't use
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
or is not able to use to me the
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
tricky question is what hearsay is and i
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if you intended by
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
that word to track with what a legal
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
meaning of hearsay was
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh including with all its exceptions
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
or something more
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
like lay term just something heard from
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
someone else which itself
 
05:12:36.470 --> 05:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
is a difficult concept so if you could
 
05:12:38.550 --> 05:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little on how you
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
would think we would understand and if
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
necessary reign in the concept of
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
hearsay for use here okay
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
so basically if all of a sudden a
 
05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
background investigator goes in and
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
speaks to an individual about that
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
applied for a position
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
they go into their agency or their place
 
05:12:58.628 --> 05:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
of employment and
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
the person they spoke with says hey you
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
know i heard this person has
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
this in their personal
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
personnel file
 
05:13:08.240 --> 05:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
personnel file
but

05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:13:09.760 --> 05:13:10.390 align:start position:0%
but
so

05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
and there the investigator says can you
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
provide that for me no it's only
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
something i heard from you know a past
 
05:13:19.830 --> 05:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
person that worked here or
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
um somebody even before that it's just
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
something i've never seen anything like
 
05:13:23.520 --> 05:13:24.708 align:start position:0%
something i've never seen anything like
this

05:13:24.708 --> 05:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
but that's what i heard
 
05:13:28.868 --> 05:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
so that's what i'm saying for hearsay
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
meaning by hearsay so if all of a sudden
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
that same situation hey i heard that you
 
05:13:38.230 --> 05:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
know this person did have a write-up for
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
this and they go into their personnel
 
05:13:40.320 --> 05:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
this and they go into their personnel
file

05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
file
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
and it's there
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
then it can be used
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
i want something that's going to match
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.798 --> 05:13:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
also

05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
taking my questions representative um
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
first question i have is
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 56
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
applies to pretty much any employee and
 
05:14:13.990 --> 05:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
every employer in the state
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposing to add 275 56 a
 
05:14:23.040 --> 05:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
proposing to add 275 56 a
um

05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh pertains only to public employers why
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
would this not pertain to
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
private employers
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
um because i was focusing on the public
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
more than
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
because more than likely
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
public employees are going to ask for
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
background investigations or ask you to
 
05:14:54.390 --> 05:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
to submit to one compared to
 
05:14:56.948 --> 05:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
the private
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you mr chairman
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the next question i have is
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
under the definition of
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be down close to the
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of your page where it talks about
 
05:15:19.360 --> 05:15:20.868 align:start position:0%
bottom of your page where it talks about
uh

05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
public servants shall mean a list of the
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
following and it there's a several in
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
that are included in there that
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of wondering why they're
 
05:15:32.948 --> 05:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
including one one legislators why would
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
a legislator
 
05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
fall under the term public servant for
 
05:15:36.560 --> 05:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
fall under the term public servant for
the

05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh for in terms of pre-employment
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's a couple other ones i guess you
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
could make the argument for also you
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
know why
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
why are they included
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
um again when they wrote it
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
i explained to them what i wanted and i
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
thought that might have already been in
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
there so that's why i did not remove it
 
05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
if they were not i have no problem um
 
05:16:02.708 --> 05:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
amending that and having it removed
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative one more follow-up thank
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman uh final follow-up um
 
05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
since this is
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
targeted to uh public employers i'm
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
assuming most
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know firemen
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
police in general or or whatever
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
is is there a
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
reason this
 
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
could not be something that you could
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
obtain in a collective bargaining
 
05:16:27.360 --> 05:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
obtain in a collective bargaining
agreement

05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
look good good question a lot of small
 
05:16:32.160 --> 05:16:33.670 align:start position:0%
look good good question a lot of small
agencies

05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
do not and not just that not all
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
true i understand that
 
05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
my my point is you could include i'm
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
as an example i
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
as part of my union i have
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
access to my personal files and that's
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
included in our collective bargaining
 
05:16:58.480 --> 05:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
included in our collective bargaining
agreement

05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:17:01.670 --> 05:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
why could
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why you could not
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
include in
 
05:17:05.360 --> 05:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
include in
say

05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
you police or firemen i don't even know
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
which what i'm assuming you want one of
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
the two why could
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
that not be including in collective
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
bargain bargaining agreement even to
 
05:17:19.390 --> 05:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
include a
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
pre-employment background check
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if i didn't ask that as
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to think of the appropriate
 
05:17:31.600 --> 05:17:31.610 align:start position:0%
way to explain it
 
05:17:31.610 --> 05:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
way to explain it
[Music]

05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
because i
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
because most people are most
 
05:17:41.350 --> 05:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
administrators are gonna fight this as
 
05:17:43.030 --> 05:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna probably hear in testimony
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
05:17:44.240 --> 05:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
coming up
um

05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's the appropriate
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you thank
 
05:17:53.440 --> 05:17:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you thank
you

05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
following up on what rep uh turcotte was
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh talking about a minute ago
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
line 21 refers to
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
be public servant
 
05:18:14.638 --> 05:18:16.868 align:start position:0%
be public servant
um

05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
would it not be more appropriate to have
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
public employee there rather than
 
05:18:21.680 --> 05:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
public employee there rather than
servant

05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
servant
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about a
 
05:18:26.550 --> 05:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
pre-employment background check
 
05:18:26.560 --> 05:18:27.430 align:start position:0%
pre-employment background check
and

05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
public servants a lot of the public
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
servants that are listed there are not
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
employees yeah may i interrupt for a
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
second before you answer the question
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
just so i'm not confused here
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
is the only part we're talking about of
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
adding is and pre-employment background
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
checks as emboldened and the rest is
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
current law
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay i have that wrong
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i apologize i just want
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're on the same page here
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan asked a question
 
05:18:58.230 --> 05:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you still recall the question uh you
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
can pretty repeat that please sure no
 
05:19:00.480 --> 05:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
can pretty repeat that please sure no
sorry

05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:19:01.920 --> 05:19:03.270 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

05:19:03.270 --> 05:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
i was looking down at section uh roman
 
05:19:06.160 --> 05:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
i was looking down at section uh roman
two

05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh part b
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
refers to public servant and i was
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
questioning whether or not public
 
05:19:16.550 --> 05:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
servant ought to be public employee
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
because you've got a public employer
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
above that
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
and employers
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
have employees
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
not servants
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes that that could be amended okay
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
there there seems to be a little
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
confusion around
 
05:19:38.480 --> 05:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
confusion around
uh

05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
public servants and uh the list of
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
specific titles um can you see any
 
05:19:47.670 --> 05:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
reason why an amendment to just
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
make it anybody that has to undergo a
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:19:54.628 --> 05:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh couldn't receive a copy of that
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
are you looking for private and public
 
05:19:57.040 --> 05:19:58.948 align:start position:0%
are you looking for private and public
or

05:19:58.948 --> 05:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
public i would be
 
05:20:03.430 --> 05:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the liberty of the chair to explain
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
context i would be interested in
 
05:20:07.270 --> 05:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
submitting an amendment to broaden it
 
05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh to private and public but i'm asking
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
you because you are more familiar with
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
the rsa than i am having explored it um
 
05:20:15.520 --> 05:20:16.708 align:start position:0%
the rsa than i am having explored it um
whether

05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
you could see any reason why that would
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
be a problem
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
follow a question uh just a quick
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up um you also uh expressed a
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
moment ago that you might have some
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
familiarity with union negotiations um
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
05:20:35.840 --> 05:20:36.788 align:start position:0%
would you agree
that

05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
um by removing a component from
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation allows both the union the
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
management to focus on other parts of
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
the contract
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
that they might be more interested in
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
reaching negotiations on versus burning
 
05:20:50.948 --> 05:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
fuel on
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh claiming a background check
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i could i could see them spending
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
more time
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
on other pads if we didn't have to deal
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
with this in the union contract thank
 
05:20:59.360 --> 05:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
with this in the union contract thank
you

05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:03.750 --> 05:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions any further
 
05:21:03.760 --> 05:21:04.708 align:start position:0%
any further questions any further
questions

05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
i i have a couple i just want to i've
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
never seen this in 16 years on this
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee so bear with me here
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
there are certain
 
05:21:13.360 --> 05:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
there are certain
jobs

05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire you were
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at police fire emts
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
is what you've mentioned a few times
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you would like to
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
possibly get employed by the state of
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
or or town or whatever or if you would
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:33.200 --> 05:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
possibly

05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
get a promotion or a higher ranking job
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
within those if you're already in them
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
you need to have a pre-employment
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:21:46.708 --> 05:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
is that what you're trying to say so
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
basically if you are going for a if
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're a new candidate to an agency
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
some ems
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
you they re they ask you to submit to a
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
background investigation yes
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
once you're in the agency
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
and there is a promotion i don't believe
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask to do another
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
background on you because you're already
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
working for them okay
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
so if all of a sudden you're working for
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
one agency now
 
05:22:19.760 --> 05:22:20.788 align:start position:0%
one agency now
and

05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
you decide you know what i want to go to
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
a larger agency smaller agency and you
 
05:22:25.440 --> 05:22:26.708 align:start position:0%
a larger agency smaller agency and you
apply

05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
apply
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
then you go through their process and
 
05:22:28.798 --> 05:22:30.868 align:start position:0%
then you go through their process and
then

05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:22:30.878 --> 05:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
then
they

05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to consider you for the
 
05:22:33.040 --> 05:22:34.230 align:start position:0%
they're going to consider you for the
position

05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
then they'll give you a conditional
 
05:22:36.320 --> 05:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
then they'll give you a conditional
offer

05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
offer
 
05:22:40.548 --> 05:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
and then do a background investigation
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
background investigation can include
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
a credit check
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
possibly a criminal background check yes
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
from the either the state or the feds
 
05:22:51.360 --> 05:22:52.868 align:start position:0%
from the either the state or the feds
um

05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
anything else they can go see your talk
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
to your fellow employees your current
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know what what the extent so most
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know i'm more experienced on the law
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement side
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so once you get that you know it's
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
assigned to a background investigator
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know um you fill out this
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
questionnaire you give it to them
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
they'll do a credit report normally
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
colonel record a motor vehicle record
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
past employment they'll talk with
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
employees they're supposed to talk to
 
05:23:27.440 --> 05:23:28.548 align:start position:0%
employees they're supposed to talk to
your

05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
significant other
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
very similar as a friend of mine went to
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
work for the nsa
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
fbi came to see me something somewhere
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
like that getting a background check
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
asking questions all right so
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
you have all this stuff done
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
you either do receive the job
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
or you pass the cred to check and and
 
05:23:55.120 --> 05:23:55.910 align:start position:0%
or you pass the cred to check and and
they

05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
follow through with the conditional
 
05:23:57.600 --> 05:23:58.548 align:start position:0%
follow through with the conditional
offer

05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
offer
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
or you fail and you don't
 
05:24:03.190 --> 05:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
you would like
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to review what is in that
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
the information that was
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh obtained through that background
 
05:24:16.230 --> 05:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
what reason
 
05:24:18.718 --> 05:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
what reason
would

05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:24:20.080 --> 05:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
would
the

05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:21.120 --> 05:24:22.548 align:start position:0%
the
entity

05:24:22.548 --> 05:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
entity
 
05:24:22.558 --> 05:24:24.230 align:start position:0%
entity
that

05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
requested that background check to be
 
05:24:26.240 --> 05:24:27.030 align:start position:0%
requested that background check to be
done

05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
not want to provide it to you
 
05:24:29.200 --> 05:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
not want to provide it to you
i

05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for
 
05:24:32.000 --> 05:24:32.948 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for
them

05:24:32.948 --> 05:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware if there's any
 
05:24:35.680 --> 05:24:40.708 align:start position:0%
are you aware if there's any
potential

05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.718 --> 05:24:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
legal

05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
action that could be taken against the
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:49.590 --> 05:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
perform the report and that's the
 
05:24:49.600 --> 05:24:50.948 align:start position:0%
perform the report and that's the
concern

05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
that could be because if all of a sudden
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
somebody gives false information
 
05:24:54.798 --> 05:24:56.230 align:start position:0%
somebody gives false information
defamation

05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
defamation
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
or something like that i would take it
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
civil action
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
would you think an individual who was
 
05:25:07.350 --> 05:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
denied would want to be able to see
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
that report
 
05:25:10.230 --> 05:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
to see if there's something in there
 
05:25:10.240 --> 05:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
to see if there's something in there
that's

05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
possibly wrong because someone used an
 
05:25:13.600 --> 05:25:15.190 align:start position:0%
possibly wrong because someone used an
incorrect

05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
name initial or social security number
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
to obtain that information no
 
05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
i have well my point is wouldn't you
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
want to correct it if something's wrong
 
05:25:23.360 --> 05:25:24.230 align:start position:0%
want to correct it if something's wrong

try to get that information that would
 
05:25:45.190 --> 05:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
be required here whether that's been
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to get

in saying that this bill is not
necessary

05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
and will harm what are
 
05:27:40.470 --> 05:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
and should remain rigorous and stringent
 
05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
hiring process processes
 
05:27:45.990 --> 05:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
i often say a phrase when we talk about
 
05:27:46.000 --> 05:27:47.350 align:start position:0%
i often say a phrase when we talk about
hiring

05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
in our agency and with other law
 
05:27:51.750 --> 05:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement practitioners show me a bad
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
police officer and i'll show you a bad
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
background investigation and i've found
 
05:27:58.548 --> 05:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
that to be true
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
most often
 
05:28:02.788 --> 05:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
within the bill most glaringly is the
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
fact that the bill uses the term the
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
employer which would lead one to assume
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
that a candidate for a position within a
 
05:28:11.830 --> 05:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
public service entity
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
is an employee
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is clearly not the case and as such
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
a candidate is and should not be
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
entitled to receive a copy of the
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
investigatory background report
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
my second point of argument comes with
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
the following language
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if you could refer to the bill
 
05:28:32.548 --> 05:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
respectfully i ask you to do so
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 12 through
 
05:28:34.878 --> 05:28:36.628 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 12 through
16

05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
16
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll read it directly
 
05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
the employer shall not use any prior
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
arrest charge detention information
 
05:28:46.390 --> 05:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
in determining a candidate's suitability
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
if such arrests or charge was dropped or
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
if the candidate was found not guilty at
 
05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
trial or annulled by a court
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is very problematic for several
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
reasons most notable of which is the
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
fact that it conflicts with the
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
requirements set forth within police
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
standards and training policy
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
301.05 which i've attached to my
 
05:29:09.120 --> 05:29:10.470 align:start position:0%
301.05 which i've attached to my
testimony

05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at subsections subsection g
 
05:29:17.110 --> 05:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
numbers 2 3 4 5 and 15 which i've
 
05:29:17.120 --> 05:29:19.110 align:start position:0%
numbers 2 3 4 5 and 15 which i've
highlighted

05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
these certainly apply to the language
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
contained within the bill that's before
 
05:29:23.920 --> 05:29:24.708 align:start position:0%
contained within the bill that's before
you

05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
in our direct conflict with these
 
05:29:27.120 --> 05:29:28.708 align:start position:0%
in our direct conflict with these
requirements

05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
i would also note that just because a
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
person has had a charge annulled
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
that that a charge was dropped or that
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
an applicant was not found not guilty of
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
a charge does not mean that this would
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate questions regarding the
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
character and reputation of that person
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
that is specifically dealt with in
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
moreover this should not hinder an
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
agency's determination and right to
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
refuse suitable
 
05:29:56.160 --> 05:29:57.270 align:start position:0%
refuse suitable
employment

05:29:57.270 --> 05:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
to a person
 
05:30:00.230 --> 05:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
they feel would not be a suitable
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
candidate for positions within public
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
service like law enforcement where
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
individuals are entrusted with immense
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
powers and responsibilities
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
in the 20 plus years i've served as a
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
police officer i've conducted a lot of
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
background investigations
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
for both sworn and non-sworn applicants
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
as any law enforcement executive will
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
recruitment and selection of officers is
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most important if not the
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
most important function of a law
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
this also extends to other public
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
service agencies as well such as police
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
fire etc etc
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
numerous times i have recommended the
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
disqualification of applicants
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
which stem from information developed
 
05:30:48.868 --> 05:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
from witnesses who are not listed in an
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
applicant's personal history
 
05:30:50.240 --> 05:30:51.990 align:start position:0%
applicant's personal history
questionnaire

05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
questionnaire
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
as you are aware there's been
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
considerable scrutiny in conversation
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
about police hiring practices
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
and how vetting processes or lack
 
05:31:00.480 --> 05:31:01.510 align:start position:0%
and how vetting processes or lack
thereof

05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
have allowed individuals with
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
suitability issues to slip through the
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
proverbial cracks
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
as such this is not the time
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
nor should it ever be the time
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
to diminish the ability of law
 
05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to conduct thorough
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
and complete background investigations
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
and to make a decision to disqualify an
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
applicant given information gleaned from
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
their investigation
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
there is already a process which
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
representative trottier spoke to and
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
some of you spoke to as well
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
for a person who feels aggrieved given
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
the outcome of a background
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
investigation or hiring decision
 
05:31:40.470 --> 05:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that process is through civil
 
05:31:40.480 --> 05:31:41.750 align:start position:0%
and that process is through civil
litigation

05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
if a person does not agree with the fire
 
05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
a finding they can simply simply follow
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
civil process
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
and ask that a court decide whether a
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
finding regarding the suitability for
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
employment or release of such
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
information is legitimate or was
 
05:31:57.280 --> 05:31:58.788 align:start position:0%
information is legitimate or was
legitimate

05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
finally i would be remiss if i did not
 
05:32:04.548 --> 05:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
mention the privacy issues that might
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
arise when
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass what i'm
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
is those who cooperate with the
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
background investigation and provide
 
05:32:13.760 --> 05:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
background investigation and provide
information

05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
detrimental to an applicant's
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
suitability for employment
 
05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
and this happens
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
developed references those are the
 
05:32:24.390 --> 05:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
references we look at those are the
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
references outside
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
the references in which an applicant
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
lists on their application and
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they possess the best
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
information about a candidate and their
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
suitability for employment
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
and those people that we speak to they
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
operate under the assumption that the
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
information they are providing will be
 
05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
held in confidence and not
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
used as a tool of retaliation
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
and this is critical
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
my last few points i just want to
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
mention a few things first of all the
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence schedule
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
was a topic that was raised
 
05:32:57.360 --> 05:32:58.390 align:start position:0%
was a topic that was raised
there

05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was passed 105
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
r 105 13 d
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
which clarifies the process
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general in the state
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire will follow in order to
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
have a vetting process for officers who
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
have exculpatory
 
05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
information in their background and to
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
allow that information become public so
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
there is already a process in place for
 
05:33:20.558 --> 05:33:21.830 align:start position:0%
there is already a process in place for
that

05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's law
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
there's there was a bill passed last
 
05:33:28.150 --> 05:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session i believe it was
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor in november rsa
 
05:33:33.990 --> 05:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
226 1 colon 1
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
which deals with release of background
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
information to law enforcement agencies
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
and so other agencies can call another
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and obtain information relative to
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
background investigation
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
this seems like an issue with individual
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
agency process
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative trottier spoke
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
a lot about individual agency process
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
and procedure
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
and to me this bill is not necessary
 
05:34:04.150 --> 05:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
because the issue comes within those
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
specific agencies that maybe don't
 
05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
follow a set process and procedure
 
05:34:09.200 --> 05:34:13.670 align:start position:0%
follow a set process and procedure
lastly

05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you've ever conducted any type of
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
hiring process you will know that
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-public employees
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get information from a
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
non-public employer
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
is extremely difficult and oftentimes
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
you can only get confirmation of dates
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
of employment and maybe if you're lucky
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
salary information
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
05:34:37.590 --> 05:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
i ask you to to please respectfully
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
please find the spill in expedient to
 
05:34:39.280 --> 05:34:40.788 align:start position:0%
please find the spill in expedient to
legislate

05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i will certainly answer any
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth
 
05:34:48.390 --> 05:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
early on in your testimony you
 
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
made a statement about a candidate who
 
05:34:58.390 --> 05:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
is rejected is not an employee and
 
05:34:58.400 --> 05:34:59.830 align:start position:0%
is rejected is not an employee and
therefore

05:34:59.830 --> 05:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be entitled to
 
05:35:02.000 --> 05:35:03.030 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be entitled to
resp

05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
resp
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the supreme court decision that the
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor referenced and
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
the scope of that and how that
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
intersects with your statement i'm not
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
05:35:16.958 --> 05:35:18.788 align:start position:0%
aware of that
um

05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:20.548 --> 05:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
and and i wouldn't feel comfortable
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
commenting on it but i can certainly
 
05:35:23.750 --> 05:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
research that and provide further
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
clarification to the committee if needed
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
chief i have a few questions for you yes
 
05:35:33.440 --> 05:35:34.788 align:start position:0%
chief i have a few questions for you yes
sir

05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
you got me in a rock and a hard place
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
here chief
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
because i have a lot of
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
admiration and respect for the
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
i'm tossed here as to what you're asking
 
05:35:49.990 --> 05:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
us to do
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
first off i don't think anyone has a
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
would you would you imagine or what you
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
was trying to say
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with removing
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the items you talked about through lines
 
05:36:05.830 --> 05:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
12 through 16
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
regarding the suitability and
 
05:36:08.718 --> 05:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
regarding the suitability and
previous

05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.990 --> 05:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
detentions arrest charges et cetera even
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
but i don't understand
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
that a and i'm not calling an employer
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
because you know that as well a
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
prospective employer i guess would be an
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:35.110 --> 05:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
how would you like it if you didn't get
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
a position for something and you
 
05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't find out
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
why if there was anything in that
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
investigation without filing a civil
 
05:36:43.520 --> 05:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
investigation without filing a civil
lawsuit

05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
from my experience
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
when a person is denied employment
 
05:36:56.470 --> 05:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll speak as a chief if i deny
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
employment to a candidate based on a
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
suitability issue that candidate will be
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
provided with a reason why they're
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
denied employment
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
they don't just simply receive a phone
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
call or a letter in the mail it says you
 
05:37:09.430 --> 05:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
know thanks for applying we're not
 
05:37:11.830 --> 05:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward there's whether it's a
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
two or three sentence explanation as to
 
05:37:13.760 --> 05:37:14.628 align:start position:0%
two or three sentence explanation as to
why

05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh they were disqualified from
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
consideration is provided because we
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't want those questions for can that
 
05:37:23.430 --> 05:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want a candidate to
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
have those questions but in my
 
05:37:26.788 --> 05:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
experience and i've done a lot of these
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
over the years candidate knows exactly
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
why they're disqualified
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
they know exactly why they're
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
disqualified there are rigorous
 
05:37:34.480 --> 05:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
disqualified there are rigorous
processes

05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
processes
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
particularly with police and law
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement background checks multiple
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
stages within a hiring process that we
 
05:37:42.240 --> 05:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
stages within a hiring process that we
follow

05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
and so it comes as no surprise it should
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
come as no surprise to any candidate why
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're denied employment
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not my experience and
 
05:37:51.840 --> 05:37:52.868 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not my experience and
it's

05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
i i just feel this bill is not needed
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
another question um
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the process
 
05:38:02.320 --> 05:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the process
of

05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:38:05.590 --> 05:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
the civil
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
so if someone is denied they want to
 
05:38:09.270 --> 05:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
know why
 
05:38:10.708 --> 05:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
05:38:12.788 --> 05:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
you would not provide them
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
a file of your background check
 
05:38:20.830 --> 05:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned they have to file a civil
 
05:38:20.840 --> 05:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
you mentioned they have to file a civil
proceeding

05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
did i hear it correctly in saying that
 
05:38:25.590 --> 05:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
if they choose to fall
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
should they choose to do that
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to find out is it a
 
05:38:34.470 --> 05:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
futile effort to do that because
 
05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be um
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
discoverable or would it be
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
that file
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
or that background check so it's one
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
thing to file a civil suit it's another
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
one for the person receiving the civil
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
suit to ask for a summary judgment
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
because based on another law you're not
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
can i give you a scenario please okay
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
so within hollis we operate a
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
communication center and it's a regional
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
dispatch center
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
and although they're not part of the
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
police department
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
um they're a town agency and they're
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
governed by an advisory board in which i
 
05:39:18.628 --> 05:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
sit on
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
last year we had an applicant
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
applied for a position with as a
 
05:39:22.798 --> 05:39:24.390 align:start position:0%
applied for a position with as a
dispatcher

05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
dispatcher
 
05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
and in the process of his initial
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
pre-employment questionnaire
 
05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
he provided information
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
that the detective then verified
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
was inaccurate and it involved the case
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
with a domestic situation with the
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
former intimate partner
 
05:39:42.480 --> 05:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
former intimate partner
and

05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
this young lady was very concerned about
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of the information
 
05:39:49.750 --> 05:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
she was providing
 
05:39:51.590 --> 05:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
and he was denied employment for that
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
because it was a serious issue and it
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
impacted his credibility as a public
 
05:39:56.878 --> 05:39:58.230 align:start position:0%
impacted his credibility as a public
servant

05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
servant
 
05:39:58.240 --> 05:39:59.350 align:start position:0%
servant
um

05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
a few and he was provided notification
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
why he was
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
disqualified from employment
 
05:40:07.270 --> 05:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
a few weeks after i received a letter
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
from an attorney
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
um requesting a copy of all the files
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
collected relative to his background
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
including the background report
 
05:40:19.350 --> 05:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
and when i received the letter i
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly consulted with town council
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
and they told me that it was appropriate
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
to deny
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
the background packet
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
to this applicant for the very reasons i
 
05:40:31.510 --> 05:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
just stated
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so i
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
i look at it not just in terms of
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
confidentiality mr chair but also
 
05:40:37.680 --> 05:40:38.868 align:start position:0%
confidentiality mr chair but also
protecting

05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
the agency in the town from civil
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
liability if i were to release
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
information that could then be held
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
against the person
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
that provides information to us in the
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
course of a background investigation
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
there could be serious consequences and
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
to be frank with you i don't want to be
 
05:40:57.190 --> 05:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
associated with that and i don't want to
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
be responsible for that so if it comes
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
down to it if if a person files a
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
a court tells me requires me to do it i
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
will follow the court's order but there
 
05:41:10.390 --> 05:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
is already a process for that this bill
 
05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
is not necessary in my humble opinion
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i say that with all due respect mr
 
05:41:14.400 --> 05:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
and i say that with all due respect mr
chair

05:41:15.190 --> 05:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:41:16.070 --> 05:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your candidate
 
05:41:20.708 --> 05:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:21.990 --> 05:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago you
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
you said that if you deny employment to
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
a candidate you
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
explained to them why
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
and then you followed that up by saying
 
05:41:34.638 --> 05:41:36.390 align:start position:0%
and then you followed that up by saying
that

05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
this one candidate that you denied
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
employment to
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
was denied because of
 
05:41:41.520 --> 05:41:42.548 align:start position:0%
was denied because of
um

05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:44.788 --> 05:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
an issue with a former intimate partner
 
05:41:44.798 --> 05:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
an issue with a former intimate partner
who

05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to have it
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
kept confidential how do those two
 
05:41:50.320 --> 05:41:51.350 align:start position:0%
kept confidential how do those two
things

05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:41:51.360 --> 05:41:53.110 align:start position:0%
things
mesh

05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
mesh
 
05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
well obviously we'd you know we wouldn't
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
provide specific information about
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
the person providing the information
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
etcetera etcetera we provide them with a
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
a general explanation
 
05:42:05.590 --> 05:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know and for example i can recall
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
the verbiage that i used for that one it
 
05:42:07.840 --> 05:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
the verbiage that i used for that one it
was

05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
due to truthfulness
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
given your
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:42:13.840 --> 05:42:14.868 align:start position:0%
you know
former

05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
former
 
05:42:14.878 --> 05:42:16.230 align:start position:0%
former
former

05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
former
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
activities or engagement in the
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
information you you provided to the
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
background investigator on this date you
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
were denied employment and i can tell
 
05:42:27.030 --> 05:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
you he knew exactly why he was denied
 
05:42:27.040 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
you he knew exactly why he was denied
employment

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:42:30.070 --> 05:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
there is no question
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:42:33.430 --> 05:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
that he didn't know
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually a different question entirely
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that
 
05:42:48.788 --> 05:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
non-public employers
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes give nothing um other than
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
dates of employment etc i believe that
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
might be true of some public employers
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:42:57.200 --> 05:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
as well
um

05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
why why is that
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think they're genuinely i i don't know
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
i can give you a correct answer but my
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
assumption is is that they're concerned
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
about the confidentiality of of an
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
employee's uh file
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know oftentimes these these files
 
05:43:14.788 --> 05:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
and records contain protected
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
information medical records etc etc
 
05:43:18.788 --> 05:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
and so they
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think private companies have
 
05:43:23.030 --> 05:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know have become very protective of
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
what's included in those files which
 
05:43:27.430 --> 05:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know can be detrimental in some
 
05:43:29.830 --> 05:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances i would agree with that
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which both of you
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative i will only follow or
 
05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time governor of turcotte
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
followed by abulani whatever thank you
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you for taking my call
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
my call my question i know what you
 
05:43:44.718 --> 05:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
my call my question i know what you
meant

05:43:47.190 --> 05:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
um you were mentioning that you've been
 
05:43:51.670 --> 05:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
doing this for quite a few years and i
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming you've done uh many of
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
these background checks
 
05:44:00.868 --> 05:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
the individual being denied the job
 
05:44:04.628 --> 05:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
generally knows and i would tend to
 
05:44:06.628 --> 05:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
agree what i would think that would be
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
the case
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
how many of your denials have actually
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
res give me a ballpark on how many times
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
you've denied an applicant employment
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
and then how many times your denials
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
have resulted in a civil suit
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh no civil suits
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
one request for background report which
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
is the one i just spoke to the chair
 
05:44:29.520 --> 05:44:30.868 align:start position:0%
is the one i just spoke to the chair
about

05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
i've done at least
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to inflate this but this
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
is just an estimate
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
background investigation personally
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
between 75 and 100
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
in my time and
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
obviously as a chief i in the final
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
decider of employment for folks so
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%

05:45:03.510 --> 05:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:05.910 --> 05:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
the pre-employment background check if
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
if it is successful would become part of
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
the permanent file of the personal file
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the employee that is correct yes
 
05:45:15.030 --> 05:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
having said that there are parts that
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
would potentially be protected medical
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
records uh psychological examination etc
 
05:45:20.400 --> 05:45:22.948 align:start position:0%
records uh psychological examination etc
etc

05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
etc
 
05:45:24.788 --> 05:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
yes please so they would not have access
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
to their psychology psychologically they
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
would outside employees may not
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily have that
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
typically when we do backgrounds we have
 
05:45:34.150 --> 05:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
an applicant fine
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
file a a waiver form
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
which permits us in contacting say if if
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm hiring a certified police officer
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm doing a background
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
or one of my personnel is doing a
 
05:45:45.760 --> 05:45:46.788 align:start position:0%
or one of my personnel is doing a
background

05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
background
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
and they reach out to the other agency
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
agencies will ask for that waiver uh for
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
release of information because they want
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves from
 
05:46:00.548 --> 05:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered your question
 
05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so so all that
 
05:46:07.708 --> 05:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
investment investor
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
investigatory paperwork would be part of
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
the permanent file
 
05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct yes anything we
 
05:46:16.150 --> 05:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
gather and collect throughout the course
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
of an investigation background
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
investigation would be part of their
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
personnel file
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
and one last one sure
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire most most if not
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
all employees
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently working or fired or
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
moved on to other jobs have access to
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
their personnel files yes
 
05:46:36.390 --> 05:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
would there be anything that
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be precluded
 
05:46:39.670 --> 05:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
out of the pre-employment background
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
check that an applicant would not be
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:47.590 --> 05:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i i don't really understand your
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
question you talked about employers as
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to applicants
 
05:46:54.150 --> 05:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
correct if there's an applicant that has
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
you have an employee who's
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
has total access to your employment file
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct i have an applicant that
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
is looking for a pre-employment
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
background check report
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
of some sort or why they were denied
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
if it became part of their permanent
 
05:47:07.680 --> 05:47:08.708 align:start position:0%
if it became part of their permanent
file

05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
file
 
05:47:10.150 --> 05:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
why would it not be
 
05:47:12.470 --> 05:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
why would we not be giving it to them
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.030 --> 05:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
well i mean my take is an employee is
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
entitled to those records they're an
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
employee an applicant's not an employee
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative representative mandeville
 
05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chief uh for your
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um i understand the back and
 
05:47:35.590 --> 05:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
forth about the access to information my
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
concern as i mentioned to representative
 
05:47:39.510 --> 05:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
charity is a little different
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh it's based on my read whether it's
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
correct or not of the sentence that
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
starts at line 11
 
05:47:49.750 --> 05:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
the source of any information used
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
by the employer to determine a candidate
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
candidate's suitability for employment
 
05:47:55.110 --> 05:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
shall be in writing and shall not be
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
based on hearsay
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
that that seems to govern it seems to me
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
to govern to some extent what the
 
05:48:02.320 --> 05:48:03.590 align:start position:0%
to govern to some extent what the
employer

05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
can rely on or not
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
as we know you know
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
virtually every document is itself a
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
piece of hearsay um and
 
05:48:14.958 --> 05:48:16.070 align:start position:0%
piece of hearsay um and
um

05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:18.548 --> 05:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
and and just to give an example let's
 
05:48:19.510 --> 05:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
say a
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
fire chief was looking at a candidate
 
05:48:24.628 --> 05:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
and called the next town overs fire
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
chief who had employed this person
 
05:48:28.548 --> 05:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
before and the
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
other town chief said
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
well we thought he was starting fires
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't prove it so we just let
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
him go well that's rank hearsay as i
 
05:48:40.948 --> 05:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
read this that would not be able to be
 
05:48:43.030 --> 05:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
considered by
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
the hiring department
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
and if it were written down in a report
 
05:48:49.510 --> 05:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that would be double hearsay so it would
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
be doubly impermissible that's my
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
concern i uh do you h a share that
 
05:48:56.470 --> 05:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
concern and b
 
05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
if this were acceptable to you in terms
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
of access to documents or restriction of
 
05:49:03.350 --> 05:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
access to documents is there a way you
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
could see
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
that would fit to make
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
the uh review process as to suitability
 
05:49:09.840 --> 05:49:11.590 align:start position:0%
the uh review process as to suitability
better

05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
i am i am concerned about the the
 
05:49:15.910 --> 05:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
hearsay piece representative i think
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's extremely confusing and i would i i
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
feel as though it would restrict an
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
agency's ability to conduct a fair and
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
i can tell you a lot of witnesses
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
develop references
 
05:49:31.110 --> 05:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
listed references
 
05:49:32.310 --> 05:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
when they speak to you on the phone
 
05:49:33.990 --> 05:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's what they're engaging in they're
 
05:49:36.070 --> 05:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
providing hearsay and you know certainly
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
investigators a good investigator is
 
05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
going to attempt to corroborate that
 
05:49:42.310 --> 05:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
some things can't be corroborated
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
however i don't think it should be
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
limited that we can't use that as a
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
determination or disqualifier of
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
employment i think any good agency is
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
going to do their homework to determine
 
05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
the suitability of a candidate and
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
i have one last question
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
chief you know we got an insurance agent
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
you got a campground owner we got pilot
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
we don't do background checks i
 
05:50:06.718 --> 05:50:08.708 align:start position:0%
we don't do background checks i
understand

05:50:08.708 --> 05:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
so we're not used to how this goes
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
so are you familiar with chief ranch
 
05:50:12.798 --> 05:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
so are you familiar with chief ranch

truthfully whatever i might say some
 
05:50:38.070 --> 05:50:38.080 align:start position:0%

these as you mentioned you had done a
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
number of these
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to take one piece
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
of information one person and you're
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%

05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
something really bad
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
what you do to make sure that you
 
05:51:00.788 --> 05:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
check all of that out to make sure
 
05:51:02.628 --> 05:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
whether that was just we were friends of
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
high school but say i didn't like him at
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:51:07.830 --> 05:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
just uh an angry took my girlfriend away
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
an angry guy versus you know you know
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of background do you do when
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
you do these things it really makes sure
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
convince us
 
05:51:16.958 --> 05:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
convince us
that

05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
we don't have to be worried about what
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
you hear or say sure
 
05:51:23.440 --> 05:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
you hear or say sure
so

05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:27.430 --> 05:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
i work for an accredited law enforcement
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
agency and we have very rigorous
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
standards on on hiring
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
and um my whole career i've worked for
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
accredited agencies so we have
 
05:51:35.760 --> 05:51:36.788 align:start position:0%
accredited agencies so we have
um

05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know standards we have to meet in
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
terms of recruitment and hiring without
 
05:51:41.280 --> 05:51:42.150 align:start position:0%
terms of recruitment and hiring without
those

05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
the police academy has rigorous
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
standards defined in their policies
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
that agencies must follow
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
when they conduct background
 
05:51:52.320 --> 05:51:54.390 align:start position:0%
when they conduct background
investigations

05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
i found in my experience that
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
suitability for employment is a totality
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
of information it's not just based on
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
maybe what one or two people say
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
most candidates frankly
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
are disqualified even before they get to
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
a background investigation and if they
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
make it oftentimes we see a high number
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
of candidates who are filtered out
 
05:52:21.430 --> 05:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
during the polygraph examination
 
05:52:24.470 --> 05:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so there are very rigorous steps and
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
this is not oh you know john smith said
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
that uh joe schmoe
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
is a bad employee if that information is
 
05:52:32.558 --> 05:52:33.910 align:start position:0%
is a bad employee if that information is
provided

05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
a good investigator
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
is going to corroborate that information
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
to the best of their availability
 
05:52:43.510 --> 05:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's verifying that information
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
in some type of personnel record that
 
05:52:47.830 --> 05:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
they may have with the previous employer
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
or developing
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
additional references that they can
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
05:52:54.470 --> 05:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll use the example if i call john
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
smith and john smith says joe schmoe is
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
a bad employee you don't want him
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
working for him the next question is
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
explain to me why
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
provide me with additional people i can
 
05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that can corroborate that
 
05:53:08.310 --> 05:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
information and then i'm going to do the
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
same thing with those people i speak to
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just a one-and-done type
 
05:53:12.240 --> 05:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
it's not just a one-and-done type
scenario

05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're these investigations are
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
extensive they're time-consuming in
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
reality one background investigation
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
could equal 80 between 80 to 120 hours
 
05:53:25.830 --> 05:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
if not more
 
05:53:29.350 --> 05:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
so these aren't just done whimsically or
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
with the lack of process and
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
standardization maybe there are agencies
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
that do it that way but from my
 
05:53:34.638 --> 05:53:36.150 align:start position:0%
that do it that way but from my
experience

05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
as a police officer agencies are very
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
careful with hiring
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is because of the quote i told you
 
05:53:45.990 --> 05:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
you show me a bad cop i'll show you a
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
bad background investigation report we
 
05:53:48.558 --> 05:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
bad background investigation report we
understand

05:53:49.910 --> 05:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
the incredible importance
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
that is associated with recruitment and
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
hiring and it all starts with
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
recruitment selection of police officers
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i hope i answered your question
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for our
 
05:54:03.680 --> 05:54:05.110 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for our
chief

05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
chief
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative babyloni
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking that another question sure
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
um so the police standards and training
 
05:54:15.670 --> 05:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
sets a minimum requirement for a
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
background investigation whatever
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
whatever minimum requirements just to
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
make their academy
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that is the minimum saying that each
 
05:54:23.110 --> 05:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
department would have to have and then
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
the department would have to have
 
05:54:26.788 --> 05:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
additional or equal to that minimum
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
standard that's correct yes thank you
 
05:54:28.558 --> 05:54:33.830 align:start position:0%
standard that's correct yes thank you
guys

05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr question thank you
 
05:54:42.868 --> 05:54:42.878 align:start position:0%

05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%

05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
lobbyist okay we're going to wait a few
 
05:55:00.390 --> 05:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%

the new hampshire state police
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment and training unit
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
having been present for and listen to
 
05:55:42.628 --> 05:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
the testimony up to this point being
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
aware of the bill as introduced
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
i to stand in opposition
 
05:55:50.830 --> 05:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
my primary concern and i've heard the
 
05:55:56.718 --> 05:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
my primary concern and i've heard the
question

05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
posed in a couple of different ways why
 
05:56:04.150 --> 05:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
why why is it that we would oppose this
 
05:56:04.160 --> 05:56:05.030 align:start position:0%
why why is it that we would oppose this
bill

05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:56:07.270 --> 05:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
my primary concern is is that of the
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
chilling effect that i believe this bill
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
will have
 
05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
on the ability of law enforcement
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
agencies to conduct thorough
 
05:56:17.590 --> 05:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
investigations into what we're required
 
05:56:19.110 --> 05:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
to verify
 
05:56:21.030 --> 05:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the rules of police
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
standards and training councils
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
background investigation guidelines
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
which include
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
verifying good character
 
05:56:31.750 --> 05:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
character and convictions are are two
 
05:56:33.350 --> 05:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
very different things
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think we all
 
05:56:37.750 --> 05:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
can think of people who managed not to
 
05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
have very many convictions
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
and and had terrible character
 
05:56:47.350 --> 05:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
the reform that we've seen within the
 
05:56:51.750 --> 05:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
last year and a half or so within law
 
05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement to include the lee act
 
05:56:53.600 --> 05:56:54.788 align:start position:0%
enforcement to include the lee act
commission

05:56:54.788 --> 05:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
and governor's executive order 202019
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
which specifically
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
compels us when conducting background
 
05:57:04.628 --> 05:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
investigations to ensure that candidates
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
have not demonstrated
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
a tendency toward unlawful bias toward
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
the virtue the reason
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
the means by which we will develop
 
05:57:20.788 --> 05:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
and confirm any such concerns
 
05:57:23.910 --> 05:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
will mostly be through what has been
 
05:57:26.310 --> 05:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
accurately described as hearsay it will
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:29.520 --> 05:57:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:57:31.110 --> 05:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:57:33.430 --> 05:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
all who speak to law enforcement
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
officers in the conduct of background
 
05:57:35.760 --> 05:57:37.990 align:start position:0%
officers in the conduct of background
investigations

05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
for prospective law enforcement officers
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
have a reason to believe
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
that whatever it is they express will be
 
05:57:48.628 --> 05:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
disclosed right back to the very subject
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
of the investigation
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.470 --> 05:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
very difficult to believe
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
that what is already a difficult job
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
will not be made
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
all but impossible
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
um i echo the chief's concerns with
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
regard to um
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
civil liability i am familiar
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
with the superior court case and can
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
state that the superior court
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
did acknowledge that it was their
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
opinion that rsa 91a i believe it's sub
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph 5
 
05:58:21.840 --> 05:58:23.590 align:start position:0%
paragraph 5
does

05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
hold background investigations as a
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
manner as a matter exempted from
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure under 91a i do also agree
 
05:58:33.750 --> 05:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
with chief obecky's testimony
 
05:58:33.760 --> 05:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
with chief obecky's testimony
that

05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate means by which to
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
resolve potential issues
 
05:58:41.910 --> 05:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
and aggrieved
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
prospective employees who didn't make it
 
05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
other background investigations
 
05:58:58.788 --> 05:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
performed by other agencies i can tell
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
you that in the four and a half years
 
05:59:02.070 --> 05:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
that i've been in my position
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the hundreds of background
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
investigations over which i've held
 
05:59:08.788 --> 05:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
those other background investigations
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
can actually be some of the most useful
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
pieces of information that we get in
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
that we will find
 
05:59:18.638 --> 05:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
that we will find
patent

05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
patent
 
05:59:19.760 --> 05:59:21.110 align:start position:0%
patent
lies

05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
lies
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
committed by
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
prospective applicants
 
05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
we also hold that in balance
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
with the question of whether or not the
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
applicant at the time of their filling
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
out their pre-employment questionnaire
 
05:59:35.350 --> 05:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
with a previous
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency had merely
 
05:59:37.360 --> 05:59:38.708 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency had merely
forgotten

05:59:38.708 --> 05:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
just failed to recall
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
or had yet to commit an act that they
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
have either since disclosed to us or
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we've uncovered on our own
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
so it's really incumbent on us in
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
balancing that authority that we have to
 
05:59:54.548 --> 05:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
intrude into
 
05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
what should be
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
really private places in people's lives
 
06:00:00.788 --> 06:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
with our responsibility to ensure that
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're not putting
 
06:00:02.240 --> 06:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
we're not putting
sociopaths

06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
sociopaths
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
out on the street
 
06:00:07.350 --> 06:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
with hundreds of horsepower
 
06:00:09.990 --> 06:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
and weaponry
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we take every possible
 
06:00:15.270 --> 06:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
source of information and balance it all
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
lastly i would i would just uh point you
 
06:00:22.000 --> 06:00:22.868 align:start position:0%
lastly i would i would just uh point you
to

06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%

authority shall include in its
 
06:00:40.868 --> 06:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
investigation the check of the following
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
sources in order to determine the
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
applicant's character

pursuant to below
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
and along with listing another a number
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
of sources to develop that information
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
past and present neighbors spouses
 
06:00:57.280 --> 06:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
past and present neighbors spouses
landlords

06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%

references and number eight
 
06:01:06.070 --> 06:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that in our own
 
06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
background investigations i
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
let our candidates know
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh to a degree that i'm sometimes not
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
truly comfortable with with regard to
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
bringing up the specter of civil
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
liability why it is that they did not
 
06:01:21.110 --> 06:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
pass muster
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
a great many of those conversations
 
06:01:24.628 --> 06:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
amount to what i would characterize as
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
time and distance
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
you've made some error you just got out
 
06:01:30.868 --> 06:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
of college and surprised you acted like
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
a college kid i need to be sure you're
 
06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to stop that
 
06:01:35.830 --> 06:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
before i can
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
let you wear this uniform and go out and
 
06:01:40.470 --> 06:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
do what we do so come back to me in and
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'll give them a certain period of time
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and then there are other people who
 
06:01:44.638 --> 06:01:45.430 align:start position:0%
and then there are other people who
know

06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
as the chief testified they know exactly
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
what the issue is and so do i and
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
without even naming it
 
06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll agree to part ways sometimes
 
06:01:53.840 --> 06:01:56.390 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll agree to part ways sometimes
permanently

06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then there are some that are just on
 
06:01:59.830 --> 06:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of what i will tell them the
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
totality of the circumstances in a
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
number of areas
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
of our inquiry we have significant
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
concerns with entrusting you with the
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
authority you've asked for us to to give
 
06:02:10.480 --> 06:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
authority you've asked for us to to give
you

06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll leave it at that
 
06:02:13.440 --> 06:02:15.670 align:start position:0%
and we'll leave it at that
so

06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'll state also that in my tenure i have
 
06:02:17.920 --> 06:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
i'll state also that in my tenure i have
had

06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
one verbal request for a background
 
06:02:21.440 --> 06:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
one verbal request for a background
investigation

06:02:23.190 --> 06:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
a copy to be given to the person about
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
whom that investigation was conducted
 
06:02:28.948 --> 06:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
and one
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
case that has arisen to
 
06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation therefore
 
06:02:39.120 --> 06:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation therefore
uh

06:02:39.910 --> 06:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
along with being problematic in many
 
06:02:41.680 --> 06:02:42.628 align:start position:0%
along with being problematic in many
ways

06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
ways
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
with all due respect is um
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
frankly not necessary
 
06:02:50.470 --> 06:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony any questions for
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
president seaworth followed by avalani
 
06:02:56.470 --> 06:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:02:56.480 --> 06:02:58.788 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
testifying

06:02:58.788 --> 06:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
this may be a little too much of a
 
06:03:03.830 --> 06:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
question given your experience is one
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
civil case
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
06:03:06.638 --> 06:03:07.590 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
that

06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
should an applicant go that route
 
06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the court
 
06:03:13.200 --> 06:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
and the court
decides

06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
decides
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
to award in their favor would you think
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's likely that it might be some
 
06:03:18.798 --> 06:03:19.830 align:start position:0%
it's likely that it might be some
partial

06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
partial
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
information that the court would look at
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
all the all the documents and say well
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
these should be turned over to the
 
06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
applicant these we see reasons not to
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes sir i would expect something akin to
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
an in-camera review
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
and in the superior court case of which
 
06:03:37.750 --> 06:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm aware
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
that qualified not to be released
 
06:03:40.080 --> 06:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
that qualified not to be released
elsewhere

06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
for us to look at in a controlled
 
06:03:46.470 --> 06:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
environment qualification was given yes
 
06:03:46.480 --> 06:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
environment qualification was given yes
sir

06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you lt for
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question yes sir um
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
could part of the pre-employment
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
background check that's being requested
 
06:04:01.030 --> 06:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
be redacted
 
06:04:03.350 --> 06:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't rise to
 
06:04:05.910 --> 06:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
litigation or court review or anything
 
06:04:07.110 --> 06:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
like that could there be parts of it
 
06:04:08.470 --> 06:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know their application could be
 
06:04:11.350 --> 06:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
given back to them this could be given
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
back to them something something to
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
satisfy the need to look at that
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
background check report so
 
06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
this doesn't need to escalate further of
 
06:04:20.628 --> 06:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
the chain
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
yes sir redaction could certainly be
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
a workable solution my primary concern
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
with it is that one will take no issue
 
06:04:32.310 --> 06:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
with the letters that they see they'll
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
take they'll take issue exactly with
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
what we redact
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
and we'll basically be pointing
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:44.400 --> 06:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the follow-up um so
 
06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
witness i don't say witness testimony
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
but things like that personal
 
06:04:53.830 --> 06:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that were was given to
 
06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
the officer during the investigation
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mean that could always be
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
obviously that would be a subject to
 
06:05:02.470 --> 06:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
review but that could also be redacted
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
from the file
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
and kept
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
on your file because you guys must keep
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
filing all your applicants for a certain
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
06:05:10.830 --> 06:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
in any decent investigation
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
the investigator will always attempt to
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
generate independent corroboration
 
06:05:24.310 --> 06:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
there are times where we deal with the
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
lone voice crying in the wilderness and
 
06:05:31.110 --> 06:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the manifest weight
 
06:05:33.910 --> 06:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
of what we hope will be a chorus saying
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
hire this amazing human being or please
 
06:05:38.310 --> 06:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't do this to society
 
06:05:40.948 --> 06:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
will resonate um yes
 
06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
if redaction were a course
 
06:05:43.120 --> 06:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
if redaction were a course
then

06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
then we could redact uh
 
06:05:48.548 --> 06:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
whatever was appropriate to do so yes
 
06:05:48.558 --> 06:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
whatever was appropriate to do so yes
sir

06:05:49.510 --> 06:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
sir
 
06:05:50.628 --> 06:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you mr
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
chairman representative cahill
 
06:05:55.030 --> 06:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:05:55.040 --> 06:05:56.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
lieutenant

06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
lieutenant
 
06:05:58.868 --> 06:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
uh in the event that a person is not
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
hired and does go to the court
 
06:06:04.390 --> 06:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the court rules in their favor
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh what would the remedy be you're still
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
not going to hire him would there be a a
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
penalty a fine or a
 
06:06:15.510 --> 06:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
judgment awarded the dollar amount
 
06:06:17.190 --> 06:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
my belief is and i lack experience in
 
06:06:23.270 --> 06:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
this entirely but my belief is
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
generally most
 
06:06:26.470 --> 06:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
including those who have been our
 
06:06:29.430 --> 06:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
employees who sue us civilly are not
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
looking to come back to the place that
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
proven itself so unwelcoming and rather
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
they seek monetary damages
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
thanks very much yes sir
 
06:06:42.310 --> 06:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i have one question um regarding
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
your civil situation
 
06:06:45.430 --> 06:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
civil means money
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know people come and get some money
 
06:06:50.230 --> 06:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
but in this case
 
06:06:51.910 --> 06:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
similar to when i
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you were in the room i tried to
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
testify against trust and criminal
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
justice this week
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
you want to find out the information you
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to get to see what was done
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
is it discoverable to get a copy of that
 
06:07:11.440 --> 06:07:13.030 align:start position:0%
is it discoverable to get a copy of that
report

06:07:13.030 --> 06:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
because one thing is to have a civil
 
06:07:17.350 --> 06:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
suit but as i tried to explain before if
 
06:07:19.430 --> 06:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are other laws in place that says
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
well that's fine you can sue us but
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're still bound under
 
06:07:26.230 --> 06:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
the law not to give you a copy of this
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find out if it's
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
discoverable so
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
filing a civil suit isn't just a
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.110 --> 06:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
can they get the file if they file a
 
06:07:38.628 --> 06:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
suit through
 
06:07:38.638 --> 06:07:42.868 align:start position:0%
suit through
discovery

06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
you understand i'm not concerned if not
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
then why bother filing a civil suit if
 
06:07:47.830 --> 06:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
you can't yes sir
 
06:07:51.990 --> 06:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't know that's what i mean i i
 
06:07:55.750 --> 06:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't i don't i cannot with authority
 
06:07:58.470 --> 06:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
answer you yes or no that said i'm given
 
06:08:00.070 --> 06:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
to believe based on what i've read thus
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
far that it does not amount to a fool's
 
06:08:02.240 --> 06:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
far that it does not amount to a fool's
errand

06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
errand
 
06:08:03.200 --> 06:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
errand
um

06:08:04.150 --> 06:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
that while there may be multiple angles
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
of attack and defense um
 
06:08:08.798 --> 06:08:09.670 align:start position:0%
of attack and defense um
that

06:08:09.670 --> 06:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
from what i've seen from from the
 
06:08:12.868 --> 06:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
documentation sir
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
i believe it is a surmountable task to
 
06:08:15.680 --> 06:08:16.470 align:start position:0%
i believe it is a surmountable task to
get

06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
through civil litigation to get one's
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
background uh should it be probative in
 
06:08:24.390 --> 06:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the view of the court presiding
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
and as you said
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
let's say your
 
06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
state police does not want to see then
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's when you go to a judge for the in
 
06:08:35.760 --> 06:08:37.510 align:start position:0%
that's when you go to a judge for the in
camera

06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
camera
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
and they can look at it and make that
 
06:08:38.958 --> 06:08:40.470 align:start position:0%
and they can look at it and make that
decision

06:08:40.470 --> 06:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm confident our our legal would do
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
exactly attempt to do that sir yes all
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
right i have no further questions
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you mr
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking a lot about uh civil cases
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and all this and i just want to read or
 
06:08:57.120 --> 06:08:59.350 align:start position:0%

my name is laurie ortolano

i'm from nashua
 
06:10:30.240 --> 06:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
i'm from nashua
and

06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
i serve as the vice president of right
 
06:10:36.070 --> 06:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
to know new hampshire but i'm not here
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
um representing them on this bill
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
because we really
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
didn't know about it and hadn't taken a
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
look at it but it sort of tied in with a
 
06:10:46.470 --> 06:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill that i spoke to today downstairs
 
06:10:46.480 --> 06:10:48.948 align:start position:0%
bill that i spoke to today downstairs
regarding

06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
access to
 
06:10:50.878 --> 06:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
access to
allowing

06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
agencies to cross-reference
 
06:10:56.310 --> 06:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
personnel files and records
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
for people seeking employment and we did
 
06:10:59.910 --> 06:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
not support that
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
out of
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
concern that there might be information
 
06:11:05.270 --> 06:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
in those records that
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
could be damaging and the
 
06:11:11.270 --> 06:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
um or the records would not be correct
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
and the individual seeking employment
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
would never know and they could be
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
transmitted to agencies or departments
 
06:11:17.600 --> 06:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
transmitted to agencies or departments
that

06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
could be within the state could be
 
06:11:22.390 --> 06:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
federally or could be internationally
 
06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
and once they're disseminated and
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're out it would be very difficult
 
06:11:28.390 --> 06:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
to get control of them and correct any
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
information that might be incorrect
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation i'm in support of
 
06:11:33.920 --> 06:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
this legislation i'm in support of
personally

06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
personally
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
as a private citizen i think
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
expanding it to be
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
relative to citizens
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
private citizens is a pretty good idea
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the question about quasi
 
06:11:48.000 --> 06:11:48.948 align:start position:0%
the question about quasi
public

06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
businesses i think applies to
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
businesses that receive funding or do a
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
majority of their work
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
for public for the public for example we
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
have a downtown business that's a
 
06:12:04.628 --> 06:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
non-profit that receives half its
 
06:12:07.430 --> 06:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
funding from city money to do
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
enhancements for the downtown
 
06:12:12.390 --> 06:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
they would fall in as a quasi
 
06:12:14.948 --> 06:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
public business and i think some utility
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
companies do too if they're mandated by
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
public entities
 
06:12:19.840 --> 06:12:20.548 align:start position:0%
public entities
so

06:12:20.548 --> 06:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
there is a public feel with that quasi
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
public language in there and i think
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to look at it in
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
a public sense
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit concerned
 
06:12:35.030 --> 06:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
i understood the police department's
 
06:12:37.030 --> 06:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
issues and what they raised but this
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill had
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
broader language to other departments
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
beyond just the police department and i
 
06:12:44.150 --> 06:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you are applying for a job and
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing a background check and
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a file
 
06:12:51.510 --> 06:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to see what's in that
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
file because misinformation can be put
 
06:12:56.708 --> 06:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
there and you know i think some people
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
may well know what's in the file but you
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
still have
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
information that could be
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the use the word hearsay was stated and
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
we kind of said well hearsay can be
 
06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
anything that said but hearsay is
 
06:13:11.190 --> 06:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
something that can't be
 
06:13:13.830 --> 06:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
um confirmed or
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
proven or
 
06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
verified so not all information that
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
somebody would give would be hearsay
 
06:13:22.868 --> 06:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
and sticking to information that is
 
06:13:22.878 --> 06:13:24.548 align:start position:0%
and sticking to information that is
verifiable

06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
verifiable
 
06:13:26.788 --> 06:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
i think is important
 
06:13:29.910 --> 06:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
i understand the issue with annulling
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
and the character issues for what has
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
happened if somebody was falsely
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
arrested or
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
falsely accused of something and it
 
06:13:42.310 --> 06:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
turned out not to be the case but
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other situations that
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't include that
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
that may affect hiring where having a
 
06:13:51.590 --> 06:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
copy and getting that background check
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be useful and i don't think right
 
06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
to know law would work well i think
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
you'd find that the departments do deny
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
it that the legal counsel for cities
 
06:14:01.830 --> 06:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
would say don't give it out and when i
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
look at a whole um you know
 
06:14:06.548 --> 06:14:06.558 align:start position:0%
pre-employment file i would actually
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
question why the whole thing is denied i
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
would think parts of it could be given
 
06:14:10.798 --> 06:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
would think parts of it could be given
out

06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
and there's even an opportunity to
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
redact if you think that someone's name
 
06:14:17.910 --> 06:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
who provided information was to be
 
06:14:19.990 --> 06:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
protected you know i'd rather see some
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
effort made to give some information out
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
than a blanket denial for a hundred
 
06:14:25.510 --> 06:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
percent of it because i usually think
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's too extreme
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i did a huge right to no lawsuit in
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
nashua in december and
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get records that i thought
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
were public out of a assessing office
 
06:14:38.230 --> 06:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
was grueling it's taken me two and a
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
half years and it cost me 150 grand this
 
06:14:42.548 --> 06:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
is a big suit
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't you know encourage people
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
to go through what i went through
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
and part of it was a police
 
06:14:50.948 --> 06:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
investigation in the assessing office
 
06:14:53.110 --> 06:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
they interviewed all the staff
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i wanted copies of those interviews
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
and what was
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
said they were actually
 
06:15:01.030 --> 06:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
audio video recorded
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
and the city went along for 10 months
 
06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to give them to you
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're redacting them
 
06:15:07.510 --> 06:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have them month after month
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're coming they're coming and after
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
10 months they wrote a letter and said
 
06:15:12.868 --> 06:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
they're fully denied
 
06:15:15.270 --> 06:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i had to go into court for that
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
and um i look at records like that and
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
and their reason was hey when the people
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
were interviewed for a criminal
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
investigation they didn't know it could
 
06:15:24.230 --> 06:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
become public
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a reason
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
are you kidding me
 
06:15:27.600 --> 06:15:28.628 align:start position:0%
are you kidding me
so

06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know to have to fight over stuff
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
like that and use the court or in a
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
civil uh manner is is very time
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
consuming very costly you're going to be
 
06:15:38.470 --> 06:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
well beyond your employment window of
 
06:15:40.230 --> 06:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
finding a job and i do think there's
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
some some merit you know that an
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
individual whether they're a public
 
06:15:46.470 --> 06:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
employee or a private employee is going
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
to want to know if there's information
 
06:15:50.948 --> 06:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
in that file that can be wrong credit
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
checks can be wrong we know that it
 
06:15:54.868 --> 06:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
happens to us
 
06:15:54.878 --> 06:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
happens to us
and

06:15:55.990 --> 06:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
they need to be corrected because we're
 
06:16:01.350 --> 06:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.360 --> 06:16:02.628 align:start position:0%
 
pre

06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
pre
 
06:16:04.868 --> 06:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
employment background checks
 
06:16:07.590 --> 06:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
just the individual who is
 
06:16:09.990 --> 06:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
who is applying for the job should be
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
able to know what's in there
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
06:16:15.440 --> 06:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
any

06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for being late too i was
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
running downstairs
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
that's grace
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:35.670 --> 06:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
hi i'm h grace the new hampshire
 
06:16:37.830 --> 06:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
i believe your
 
06:16:43.030 --> 06:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
card might be wrong is this hp 1156
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:16:45.590 --> 06:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so the new hampshire municipal
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
association imposes 1156.
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
i we're particularly concerned about
 
06:16:53.270 --> 06:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through
 
06:16:53.280 --> 06:16:54.548 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through
14

06:16:54.548 --> 06:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
14
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
06:16:58.948 --> 06:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
it says the source of any information
 
06:17:00.470 --> 06:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
used by the employer to determine a
 
06:17:02.470 --> 06:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
candidate suitability for employment
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
shall be in writing and not based on
 
06:17:04.000 --> 06:17:05.430 align:start position:0%
shall be in writing and not based on
hearsay

06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
hearsay
 
06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
hearsay is a rule of evidence
 
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a definition in our
 
06:17:15.190 --> 06:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
statute so presumably we'd be using the
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rules
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
in and the definition of hearsay
 
06:17:23.350 --> 06:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh essentially that would mean that um
 
06:17:25.110 --> 06:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
any sort of statement
 
06:17:28.948 --> 06:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
is not is out of court and
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
not is being offered for its truth and
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really make sense in the
 
06:17:34.788 --> 06:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
context of
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
06:17:37.430 --> 06:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
what this
 
06:17:41.350 --> 06:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
06:17:45.030 --> 06:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the lines that i've cited 11 through
 
06:17:45.040 --> 06:17:46.628 align:start position:0%
uh the lines that i've cited 11 through
14

06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
14
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
indicate that basically it's this
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
pre-employment background check
 
06:17:52.628 --> 06:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:17:54.788 --> 06:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
really the only basis for
 
06:17:57.430 --> 06:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
denying this person um
 
06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
this candidate the ability to to move on
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the next stage or to be hired
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's probably not the case there's
 
06:18:08.070 --> 06:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know anyone who's ever hired someone
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
knows that there are a
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
series of factors that you rely on it's
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be solely on
 
06:18:14.400 --> 06:18:15.430 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be solely on
one

06:18:15.430 --> 06:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:18:15.440 --> 06:18:16.470 align:start position:0%
