00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome all the members of
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
our public to our exact session today
 
00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:13.459 align:start position:0%
both from the school boards Association
 
00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:15.189 align:start position:0%
both from the school boards Association
you're

00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh also for the committee uh we're going
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
to I I don't know have any information
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
on this supposed storm we're heading our
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
way here in terms of how that might
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
impact us but if
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
if something happens we have a number of
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
bills on Wednesday we're going to have
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
to exec and this is happening in another
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
committee too and so those bills are
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
going to have to be addressed so try to
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for driving on Wednesday
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
unless it's so buried out there for some
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
reason that um
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
we'll have to find out I have to talk to
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
leadership and find out what they plan
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
on doing with that situation represent
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
Tanner maybe if it's scheduled a little
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
later in the morning it would be better
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
too they're trying to get here
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
yeah we could do that from our
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
perspective on on the Wednesday
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
um Mike my concern is if if Wednesday's
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
out of the equation because of something
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
what do we do the the rules which we
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
have is that
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
we have to have the bills out by
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
at four o'clock on on basically or noon
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the 16th
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
but we have a session that's been put
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
into the 16th and representative Sanborn
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
in Hercules having the same problems we
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
are because they they have some bills
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
which are causing a lot of discussion we
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
had the 93 bills and we're just about
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
there so we came up against this once
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
before on this committee and what we
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
ended up having to do is the bill we
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
hadn't done we had to retain it
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
there was no other way of doing it so it
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
didn't go before we just kept the bill
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
on the committee and dealt with it in
 
00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:58.330 align:start position:0%
on the committee and dealt with it in
November

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:58.340 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
and we have not retained that many bills
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
in this committee this year we've been
 
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
really short on it last year we retained
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
13 bills and and uh so at any rate so
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
let's get on with the business of today
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to jump over HP 331 uh I have
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
to again find a little bit more
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
information on that because we we
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
skipped it
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
um last week because of the bill which
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
we had on the floor which we did resolve
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
regarding the 300 to 350 percent of the
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
medium family income for the EFA program
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
this program this one is where there is
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
no cap on the EFA program I need to get
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
some more insight as far as where we're
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
going on that so
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I will jump over that now
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
um 515 is the next bill up that I see
 
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.150 align:start position:0%
um 515 is the next bill up that I see
here

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
and so I would like look to a motion
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
from representative pentanyl on 515 this
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
is relative to education Freedom
 
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
is relative to education Freedom
accounts

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of it in
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
front of you there
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Penner now
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
or representative McDonald
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you both um I move on to pass is
 
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.140 align:start position:0%
there a second representative
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative McDonald
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh yes please 515 makes minor changes to
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
statute to keep the EFA program
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
consistent I think there's always a
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
value to updating our statutes to make
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
consistency and minor changes as some
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have urged more
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
transparency in the EFA program keeping
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
statue consistent would go along with
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
transparency thank you
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
from the second any discussion yes thank
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
you I just want to add that this helps
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
clarify the statute regarding the EF the
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts it adds
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
clarification to the authority and the
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
accountability of the scholarship
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
Association and during the hearing there
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
was some question about line 29 on page
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
two using the word intentional and I
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
think that that just brings that word up
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
to par with the use of intentional
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
online 30 on page two which is already
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
in statute suspected cases of
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
intentional and substantial that just
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
the same across all the statutes okay
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
that's represent Luna
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be uh I'm not certainly
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
not going to be supporting the ought to
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
pass on on here um because I think we've
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
got some very
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
um clear language but not but not sure
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
how it applies or how it would apply uh
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
with respect to State adequacy Grant
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
payments to schools
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
um when an EFA student may be maybe
 
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.690 align:start position:0%
um when an EFA student may be maybe
taking

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um taking classes outside of their EFA
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
at their local school because they can
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
be I believe a part-time or less than 50
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
percent student at their local schools
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's injected in two places once in
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
section four and then again in in
 
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.710 align:start position:0%
section four and then again in in
section

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.590 align:start position:0%
section
uh

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
again in section five
 
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.810 align:start position:0%
again in section five
um

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
and um and then it uh it continues to
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
perpetuate the use of intentional and
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
substantial in fact it adds intentional
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
in an area which is an possible standard
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
for pretty much anybody other than the
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to uh to determine
 
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:46.700 align:start position:0%
so I think the bill continues to
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
further the um the the lack of
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
accountability and lack of of
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
um of you know any ability to detect
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
fraud in the program as has been seen in
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
other states but you know you can't
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
catch fraud if you if you um prevent um
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
any anybody's ability to um
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
detect fraud so so uh you know so I'm
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to be supporting the
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
this question represented like us
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address the sections
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
that said the department shall make no
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
State adequacy Grant payment to the
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
school for those things and that's put
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
in there because
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
the EFA makes the payments and that way
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
there won't be double dipping and since
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
the money comes out of the students EFA
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
the state should not also be paying that
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
money a second time it paid it once to
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
put it into the EFA
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Belcher
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to comment
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
briefly on the on the language
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
surrounding the uh the intention of
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
fraud I don't think anybody wants um
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
there to be fraud in this program but I
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
think what this bill is trying to do in
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
the language is trying to do is bring it
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
in line with what you would typically
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
find in criminal law something called
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
men's Ria or the the criminal mindset is
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
something you typically have to prove in
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
order to prove somebody has committed a
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
crime that's true of murder it's true of
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
any number of crimes and the only reason
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
I can think of to not want to have to
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
prove that somebody actually had an
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
intention will be to prosecute somebody
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
from making a mistake I don't think
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's something we really want to do we
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
want to prosecute people for actual
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
fraud not for making mistake especially
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
a mistake that can be corrected
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%

prosecution is done by the Department of
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%

process from a Cooperative School
 
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.230 align:start position:0%

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
and every time we've done that we've set
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
up committees to look at that process
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
and we have come short of being trying
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
to uh determine a decent remedy to this
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to give you a brief
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
explanation of one District that's had
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
an issue in the withdrawal process from
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative School District
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk specifically about the
 
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
town of Carroll because that's been very
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
much in the news and uh and uh the whole
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
process they filed through and about
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
three times
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh town of Carroll is in the white
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
mountain region uh School District
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it was formed back in 1963 articles
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
of agreement were put together in 1963
 
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:06.260 align:start position:0%
which involved Carol Dalton Jefferson
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and Whitefield
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
at that time when they established the
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
they had a a formula based on 60 percent
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
average daily membership and 40 based on
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
some some cooperatives do it differently
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that's in their articles
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
agreement some might do a totally on
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
demographics on student population some
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
may slide more with equalized property
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
valuation this particular District does
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
it on 60 40 in terms of population and
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
since then the population in these towns
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
has significantly changed
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
and the population of Carol really has
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
significantly changed down to about 59
 
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.670 align:start position:0%
significantly changed down to about 59
students

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's 4.62 percent of the student body
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
of that particular Cooperative School
 
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.690 align:start position:0%
of that particular Cooperative School
District

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
based upon the agreement the article
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
agreement that was put together back in
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to today's figures Carol has to
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
pay on a per pupil basis forty six
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty five dollars per pupil
 
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:25.940 align:start position:0%
in that Cooperative School District
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
whereas Dalton Jefferson Lancaster and
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
Whitefield paid nine thousand one
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety dollars fourteen thousand
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
seven hundred sixty two dollars five
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred and fifteen
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
dollars and nine thousand seven hundred
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
and six dollars respectively
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
so you can see there's a significant
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
significant difference between what uh
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
the town of uh Carol is having to pay
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
right now and if anybody is driven
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
through Carroll right now
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
and I oftentimes do when I'm driving
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
over towards Berlin I drive up and over
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
the hump there and through Jefferson and
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
over I'm sure you know that about that
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
route there representative cascadden
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you go through Carol and you're
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
looking at one establishment after
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
another that is closed down
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
and yet those properties being so close
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
to White Mountains and to the ski areas
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
are still valued High yet the Rev
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
revenue or the income of those families
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
is now significantly lower than it was
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
so what we have
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
a situation where Carol has tried to
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
change the the the way things are funded
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
and they've even gone to the point where
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
they've tried to withdraw on not several
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
times and that's gone from the process
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
of them voting in their District to the
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
the total Cooperative board voting and
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative board as they've always
 
00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:47.339 align:start position:0%
voted is voted against no so it's been
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
appealed to the State Board of Education
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
and the State Board of Education has
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
heard this
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
in the most recent appeal process the
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education said this about
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
this matter one that the form the White
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
Mountain Regional School District
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
continue to engage in constructive
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
dialogue to boast a Cooperative School
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
District where five not four districts
 
00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:11.060 align:start position:0%
participate of of their own volition
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're basically said that it's now
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's time for the legislative to get out
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
and after you've gone through to and had
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
your uh Cooperative overall Cooperative
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
meeting they would also have to have a
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
super majority and the super majority is
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
a three-fifths vote and if both agree
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
then the the district is trying to leave
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
includes online two a three excuse me on
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
lines yeah three on page two a
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawal Pro uh plan shall be prepared
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
and it shall provide for the disposition
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
of property held within the cooperative
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
and a statement of assumption of
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
liabilities so this is a recommendation
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
to say if you can get the votes and it's
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
an equal vote on both levels between the
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
whole board and the leaving District so
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's some Equity there that then the
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
district would be allowed to withdraw
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the bill representative
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:14.870 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair
um

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
I I agree with uh with much of what you
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
said that um that that I think the
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
legislature does need to um to provide
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
some some updated uh policy on how a
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District would withdraw
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
from would would withdraw from a co-op
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
however during the during the hearing on
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
this bill back in January 27th we
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
actually didn't hear from
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
anybody representing a co-op District we
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
did hear from from a select board member
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
in Carroll
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
um uh which uh which is part of SAU 36
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
but we didn't hear anybody representing
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
SAU 36 or any other saus at all around
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
the state uh but but so that that's a
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's a concern but I'm also concerned
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
as to the the new language in in section
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
one on page one of the bill which is the
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um which is the the Bold language
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and not quite sure what's happening with
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 Roman 2 and Roman 3. when I read
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
roman 3
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
which talks about the vote of the entire
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um it I think it differs from what you
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
said representative Ladd I think it says
 
00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:48.140 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
the entire corporate
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
um the majority of Voters voting in
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
president vote in in the entire
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
 
00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:58.010 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
um

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
start the withdrawal process or by the
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
alternative super majority vote under
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph two which is only a which is a
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super majority of Voters
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
withdrawing pre-existing District not
 
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:24.140 align:start position:0%
the full Co-op so it's not an equal
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thing either the the co-op could do it
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
by majority which
 
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:29.750 align:start position:0%
by majority which
um

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
might make sense but this also appears
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
to me gives unilateral authority to a
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District or town who that
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
wants to withdraw from from a co-op as
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
long as they get a three-fifths uh vote
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
of just that
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District not the full Co-op
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
District that that I think it may work
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
in some cases but again without without
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
having a lot of weigh-in from from from
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
Co-op districts I I don't know what type
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
of Jeopardy this would would place on
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
them I'm also I think confused a little
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
bit by how Roman 2 is worded
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
where it starts off if a three-fifths
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
majority of Voters present voting blah
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah unless and this is
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
down the line 26 unless a three-fifth
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
super majority of Voters present in
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
voting vote in the negative so it starts
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
off if voting at three-fifths vote in
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
the affirmative unless three-fifths vote
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the negative and I'm not quite sure
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that with that
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph but I I would I would however
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair support a motion to retain on
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
the on this bill
 
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:49.790 align:start position:0%
the on this bill
um

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
and and maybe we get some I mean we we
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
had we had we had some testimony from
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
 
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.150 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
um

00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
that really I think concluded with we
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
really need a two-year study committee
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
on on this but I think we really do need
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
some input from from co-ops before we
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
plow forward with this uh you know
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
um it's in our committee I think this is
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
the place to get it done
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
I I can respond to that
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I think that you're you're misreading
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
the bill as as it's written it's yes you
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to have that type of vote amongst
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
the district that wants to get out of
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the co-op but then you're also going to
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
have the same of course and then they
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
can send it right to that board and if
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
in fact the the the town or the co-op as
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
a whole also supports that you know
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
um after you've gone through the process
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
down even sending it down to the school
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
board state board if it comes back if
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
you have a three post fifth super
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
majority of the entire Co-op membership
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
then that supports the Three-Fifths you
 
00:48:04.809 --> 00:48:04.819 align:start position:0%
have to have three-fifths on both sides
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the next paragraph it says it
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%

by the alternative super majority vote
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
under paragraph two
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
in paragraph two is a three-fifths super
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
and Ted to follow up on that on the the
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue that we need to have more input
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've had dating back to the Jim Grenier
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which we've had and all the
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
work we've done in the last session we
 
00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:51.859 align:start position:0%
know that one out of three District
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
co-ops are having problems in one shape
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
form or manner regarding the co-op and
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
membership in the co-op whether it's
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
representation on the board or it's
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
getting out of that or dealing with the
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement and we know that
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
there's some co-ops don't don't even
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
have articles of agreement yeah Mr chair
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
I agree with all of that I agree that
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
co-ops are that that there that there
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
are issues with that
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and that we need and that right now
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's not a workable solution and that
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
Co-op agreements seem to be all over the
 
00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:25.970 align:start position:0%
Co-op agreements seem to be all over the
place

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't think I don't think
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
solving it with with something that's
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is is I mean I'm not I'm not
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
reading it the way you're reading it and
 
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.470 align:start position:0%
reading it the way you're reading it and
I'm

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think solving it with
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
with with something that could be
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted or interpreted different
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
um reflective of what the true intent is
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
which is a super majority vote of the
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
Co-op and the super majority vote of the
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think if you actually wanted
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
to have both those things then it would
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
have easier language than Roman one two
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
and three in Roman two you you have your
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
vote in the district that wants to get
 
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.300 align:start position:0%
out correct
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
then you have the opportunity to send
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
that vote directly to the State Board of
 
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.650 align:start position:0%
that vote directly to the State Board of
Education

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
or correct if in fact the board as a
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
whole the all the districts votes on
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
that same
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
three-fifths or greater
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
then that's giving you the signal based
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
upon this stat story language that you
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
have the right to withdraw now if you
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
inform if you do what's also stated in
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
the on the page two there you have to
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
deal with all the Property Disposition
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
then right right and and but before you
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
even get to the properly Property
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
Disposition you have to get through
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
Romans 1 2 and 3 in Roman three uses it
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
has an or in there which which
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know to me implies that the
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District would have a
 
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.490 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District would have a
unilateral

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
unilateral
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
um if they if they had a three-fifths
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
majority vote then it would be a
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
unilateral decision on the the one
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
pre-existing tests like that so that you
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
in in the first uh section that you just
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
referenced that I discussed that occurs
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
but you also have the option in that
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
section to send on your request straight
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
directly to the State Board where the
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
State Board acts in accordance with what
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
the section you're looking at if in fact
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
the the local Cooperative School
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
District board the whole
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
decides that by a three-fifth vote we're
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to let them go it doesn't have to
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
go to the state board at that point
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's several options or routes which
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
are available
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
sitting over here getting glazed a
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and wanting to support my Cooperative
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
School District I would love to see a
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
side by side almost like
 
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.329 align:start position:0%
side by side almost like
um

00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
a ladder you know a flow chart actually
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
of what is the present method and what
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
is this method because some of it's
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
three-fifths some of its majority vote
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like one of this uh one of the
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
reasons this is like this is if the
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District wants it gets a
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
majority vote it circumvents
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
um the process that's currently in place
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
and goes directly to this state school
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
board I mean that's that's what I'm
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
looking at and I'm just wondering if
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know I I like I said I'd like to see
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
a side by side and kind of a flow chart
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay here's the withdrawing here's a
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
district that's
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with it um and it goes and
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know this is a a problem not only in
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
co-ops but I know just in our County uh
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
Sunapee pays like 50 of the county
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
budget because they have the highest
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
property value so I mean it's it's
 
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:05.870 align:start position:0%
property value so I mean it's it's
um

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a unique to co-ops
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
um to have this issue it's just with all
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
and with all the property the rights
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
that come with dissolving a co-op
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
um I think it's would be wise to retain
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
it and like I said I'd like to see for
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
me to make sense I'd like to see a side
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
by side with a flow chart okay here's
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Damon
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
I just want to note that I find Roman
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
numeral one and Roman numeral two
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
it seems to me they sort of contradict
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
each other so the first Roman numeral
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
one is talking about majority votes and
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
then Roman numeral two is talking about
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
the three-fifth super majority
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
and otherwise they seem to say the same
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
thing the way I read it so I find that
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
remarkably confusing is it a majority
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
vote or is it a three-fifth super
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
majority vote which is required
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
represent my way thank you Mr chair I
 
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.589 align:start position:0%
represent my way thank you Mr chair I
think

00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
obviously this is an important issue
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
because it it impacts Carroll County or
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
Carol more more than just Carol and so
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
my concern is kind of a piecemeal
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
approach to this
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh and that notwithstanding Rick your
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
comments about uh representative
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
grenier's uh group it would seem to me
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
that if this would be better to hold it
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
for further study so that we can begin
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
to look at this as it relates to not
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
just Carol but also other other co-ops
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we've had come before us uh and so
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we we could retain
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
this bill because I think it's something
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
that we definitely need to deal with but
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think right now we're really focused
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
on one Community rather than looking at
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
all of the other co-ops that are there
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
that may have a similar kind of an issue
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
here and that we might be able to come
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
up then with a standard that would be
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
applicable uh to all of the co-ops
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
I can respond to that that
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
I used Carol as an example of one that's
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
going on you know or one that's you know
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
very current but we've had this with
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
numerous numerous districts within
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
cooperatives is one out of three uh have
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
had this type of a problem or and and
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
there's some others having that problem
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
right now we're we're basing the payment
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
per pupil on formulas which just plain
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't work and there are all those
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement where they have
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
them and if you're in a small District
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
within a co-op you basically are have
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
been had uh you're not going to be able
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
to change that and it's it's and you can
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
see it how it's it's ruining this one
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
that I gave us the example but Connor
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
Cook's been there there's been others
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
there as well so uh
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's something I feel that we need
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
to move on if you see something that you
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
know that you think there's a misread or
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
something well flush it out but I don't
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
you've basically got two ways of
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
withdrawing in one it says if they both
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
agree you only need a majority
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
but in two and three it says that
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
if you have one agree and the other one
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
and that's why the wording is different
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
so you need if you have
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
if they both agree you need a simple
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
majority done
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
it only takes one of them
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
either one of them but you need a super
 
00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:00.849 align:start position:0%
either one of them but you need a super
majority

00:57:00.849 --> 00:57:00.859 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher I think also just
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
clarify a little further actually it
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
would take if if the withdrawing party
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave they can do so against
 
00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
the wishes of the party with a
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super majority unless the
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
other party can muster a three-fifth
 
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
super majority stop them I think the
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
biggest thing we're we're having issues
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
with is there's a couple missing or
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
misplaced commas in this there is there
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
are but also Roman Roman 3 provides the
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
third option
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm online 2829 majority of Voters
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
present voting there's a misplaced comma
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
right after at the end of that line in
 
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:45.380 align:start position:0%
the entire Cooperative School District
 
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
or by the alternative super majority
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
vote under paragraph two I'm I'm I I
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
think there's two super majority votes
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
referred to in paragraph two I think
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
they're probably talking about the first
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
one the three-fifth super majority
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
um voting in favor of with by the
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District voting in the
 
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.710 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District voting in the
affirmative

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah have voted in favor of the
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan so so Roman 3
 
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.349 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan so so Roman 3
gives

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:58:18.359 --> 00:58:19.910 align:start position:0%
gives
unilateral

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
unilateral
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
authority to withdraw to the
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District by a three-fifths
 
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.500 align:start position:0%
majority vote
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the co-op District
 
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.190 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the co-op District
vote

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's bigger of the word
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
um last last week or so we sat here and
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussed uh the village issue uh
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
overdrawal and Co-op and talked about
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
how that was distinctly different and at
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
the time we're on this table we all
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
concurred all 20 of us uh that clearly
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
the co-op issues is a problem and we
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want to piecemeal it last year
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli bought a bill to
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
eliminate all Co-op school with effect
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
of the July 3 call
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
this year we bought a piecemeal bill I I
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
think we I think the decision last week
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
on The Village was accurate by this
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee and I think the the resolution
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
or the inference that co-ops are in
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
danger depending where you happen to be
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the state depending what the value is
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
and that the entire Co-op piece needs to
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
be looked as a as a whole and brought
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
forward to so it can make everyone in
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
the State uh instead of doing piecemeal
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
pieces one time he went down there so I
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
I agree with the the concept of this
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of we need to provide
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
other options for calls for this stock
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we should not keep
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
piece Milling so we all agree there's
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
more than one issue in one town I would
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
much prefer to see a well created a bill
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
that reviews the entire Co-op situation
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
disillusionment and then bring that
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
forward versus piecemeal one at a time
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I just like to respond to what
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
I thought we had clarification on when
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
we dealt with the Bridgewater issue
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's a unique Village District which
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
has Municipal Powers with Commissioners
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
but they're not a school district and
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
that particular Town also owns their
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
Elementary School they own it and clear
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
no debt and so that that is a single and
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
we had a letter from the attorneys right
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
here in in uh Concord who indicated that
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is unique it can't be replicated or
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
duplicated anywhere in this state uh
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
seeing that the way this was initially
 
01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:39.140 align:start position:0%
set up was set up by us
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
by statutory language back in in the
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
dialogue came up the need of co-op in
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
general and that's where we all agree
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
that there's this issue around the state
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely correct on on the
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
village piece 100 and that's why the
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
committee supported I think and told
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
yeah representative rep and then
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative forville
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I had thought that we had discussed
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
back when the public hearing was held
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the way to go would be to
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
have like a actually committee or
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
commission to look at the entire thing
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
and dive into it and have all those
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
people but was that on a different bill
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
because I remember having that
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had the issue and that
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
the commission study was even we gave we
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
received a draft copy that from the
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
 
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.670 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
um

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've had that thought either committee
 
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:44.900 align:start position:0%
or commission
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh on the table here in front of us ever
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
since we've been talking about
 
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.010 align:start position:0%
since we've been talking about
cooperative

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
we're looking at one issue here there's
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
other issues that are associated with
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts that that
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
commission would be handling the whole
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
nine yards from A to Z however this one
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
how to get out and this has been an
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
issue which has come up and up and up
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
I think that this provides a clear
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
Avenue approach maybe we have the
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
comments in the wrong place that is more
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
or less an OLS technical issue that can
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
be corrected and I don't see this either
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
as a political issue at all I see this
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
is uh you know a structure of
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
organization of providing education in
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
the state and we need to
 
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.089 align:start position:0%
the state and we need to
um

01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
we need to do something we have a
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
critical situation in some towns right
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
now where they cannot afford to continue
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
going what there are based upon
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement which were written
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
back over 50 60 years ago
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
um so we've got to step in and do
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
something and the commission study is
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to be another two years or so
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
before we really uh end up with some
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
resolution on this representative you
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
had your hand up
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I guess I don't
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
see this as a piecemeal approach so this
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
is uh this is an escape Avenue for
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
members of Cooperative school districts
 
01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
and it applies to all Cooperative school
 
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
districts equally so I I well well maybe
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't address uh all the issues
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
that Cooperative school districts have
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
it certainly addresses quite succinctly
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
an escape mechanism for a community that
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
no longer wants to be part I I find the
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
mechanism to be fair and Equitable and
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
not piecemeal one of the challenges I
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
think we have is when we when we try to
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
find solutions for all of the issues
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
that that a particular organization this
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
time being cooperative School Districts
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
The Bill gets so complicated and so
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
unwieldy that it becomes very difficult
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
um I I think this has fairly clean
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
language I think OLS can put the commas
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
where where they belong and I I think
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's a good and timely Bill thank you Mr
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
chairman for further discussion
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden just bringing up
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
a point when we had that discussion with
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
Hebron and um
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
Groton in those other towns we had only
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
had gotten feedback from one side of the
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
table and I thought we had said it would
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
be nice to wait I can't remember if we
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
retained it or what we did with that
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
bill did we retain that we passed we
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
passed it okay but there was a question
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
at the time of
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we really didn't hear much
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
from the school district or from the
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
other Selectmen
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
and and I know you talked about the town
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
of Carol and I can certainly understand
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
why they would want to withdraw I mean
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
this length of time
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
um but we haven't heard from anybody
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
else either
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
and there really isn't
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
much uh other than
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
what we see an online testimony but I
 
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.190 align:start position:0%
what we see an online testimony but I
think

01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to revise some sort of
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
a a law for the withdrawal process
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
because I think more and more towns are
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
talking about withdrawing but yet the
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
governor made a point to say he wished
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
some would consolidate
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
but people don't tend to go that way for
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
some reason we we did respond we did
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
hear from the folks uh by way of the
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
brief that we got from the school boards
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
so as uh the State Board of Education
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the Carol issue
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
we had come forward that 413 people
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to withdraw 1 306 did not want
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
that to occur when it breaks down the
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
town of Carroll was 197 to withdraw with
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
67 saying no
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
then Dalton there were 60 saying yes let
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
them go 208 going the other way don't
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
let them go then we went to Jefferson 39
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
said yes they should withdraw 107 he
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
said no
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
then you have Lancaster which is one of
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
your larger out there uh 68 saying yes
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
let them go 484 saying no
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
if Wakefield same way 49 saying yes 377
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
saying no that's where I came up those
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
total figures so
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
24.303 said
 
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
let them go and so they don't have that
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
super majority and that what they're
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
going to have to do is try to get to
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
that super majority so this bill is not
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
work designed around them necessarily
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
it's just designed to provide a format a
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
process which we as a state would say
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
this is how you do it so given those
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
totals how how could this I mean let's
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
let's run it through
 
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:54.260 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
well you'd have to first of all do that
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
197 over the 67 and find out where's
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
that at three-fifths or not in the town
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
itself what was the Carol booth
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
that was it 197 yes
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
67 saying no you can do the math clearly
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
of more than two thirds so they've got
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
it that's right they've got it so and
 
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
413 saying yes four one three and then
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
no one thousand three hundred and six so
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
so only 20 less than 25 it's less than
 
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:35.180 align:start position:0%
that's right it's time
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
it's 24 24 so if you could run that
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
through Roman one two and three this
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
would be a good test case to see what
 
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
would be a good test case to see what
happens

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I I think you can do that in
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
mathematics right now yeah but but the
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
issue being is that this is a process
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
um would be a fair process because you'd
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
have the same amount for both sides
 
01:07:59.529 --> 01:07:59.539 align:start position:0%
having to get that all right
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's run it through
 
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.829 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's run it through
um

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
um you you've got you've got two-thirds
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
of Carol voting in the affirmative to
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
vote you've got 25 of the total 24 of
 
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
the total Co-op
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
voting in the affirmative what I say to
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
withdraw to vote to withdraw so
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of Carol affirmative to
 
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.130 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of Carol affirmative to
withdraw

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
24 of the total Co-op affirmative to
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw so going through
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
Roman one
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
a majority of the pre-existing District
 
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.930 align:start position:0%
a majority of the pre-existing District
um

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.570 align:start position:0%
 
doesn't

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
apply that's right and then uh and then
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh majority voted uh in the pre-existing
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative that does apply and
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
then a majority in the entire
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative in favor of withdrawal that
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply so Roman one is a fail
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
correct we're all yeah all right Roman
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
two three-fifth super majority present
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
voting in the withdrawing District vote
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative that applies that's
 
01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:14.930 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative that applies that's
true

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
unless a three-fifth super majority of
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
Voters present voting in the entire
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
Co-op District vote in the negative
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
which they did yes so so so they voted
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
against will so number two fails
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
Romans 3
 
01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
a majority of Voters present and voting
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
vote in favor that fails
 
01:09:40.739 --> 01:09:42.349 align:start position:0%
vote in favor that fails
or

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
the super majority vote under paragraph
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
two voted in favor of the withdrawal
 
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:50.060 align:start position:0%
plan that Pat that that
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
works that passes two two-thirds of
 
01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:57.470 align:start position:0%
works that passes two two-thirds of
Carol

01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
Carol
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
that vote passes so given those vote
 
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.790 align:start position:0%
that vote passes so given those vote
totals

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
totals
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
Carol would would be approved to
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
withdraw okay is that all right
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%

you look at these eyes pleased over
 
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:20.060 align:start position:0%

agreement then that that that a
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super majority of just the
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
pre-existing district is all that's
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
required to withdraw
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
if uh well no I'm not well but that's
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
what's Happening Here
 
01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
welcome Bearer Christina attorney for
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad um good morning
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
indulging me
 
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.890 align:start position:0%
indulging me
um

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about the bill specifically
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
without giving a lot of background just
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
the interest of time nhsb I think we did
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
not take a position on this bill
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I hearing the discussion today I
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
think I I think I either misinterpreted
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
or misread it or did not clearly
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
understand the scenarios that you just
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
went through shows that the two-thirds
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
super majority for the talents voting
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
the negative is completely irrelevant if
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
the town seeking to withdraw gets a
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
two-third majority vote
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
three-fifths I'm sorry whatever it was
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
three-fifths so the so the is the the
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
language about the other voters in the
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
town and the remaining towns is
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
Superfluous it's irrelevant the way the
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
land and I think we just walked through
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
the scenarios as well too that the
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
language about the the super majority of
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
the towns that are not seeking to
 
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
the towns that are not seeking to
withdraw

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant given the various with the
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
three or four scenarios that can that
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
can happen through this
 
01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:12.260 align:start position:0%
so I mean I don't
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
nhsba's position for a while has been as
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
we talked about the the
 
01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:17.450 align:start position:0%
we talked about the the
um

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh the the study commission or what
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
not over a couple years that's been
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't want to take a a
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
position specifically on this bill
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
um you know I I understand the the
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
concerns have been brought forth to this
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
committee over the last number of years
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
I will also say though that there have
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
been a handful of talented communities
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years that have been
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
able to withdraw from Co-op so it's not
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
it's not unheard of and it's not
 
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.970 align:start position:0%
it's not unheard of and it's not
impossible

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.050 align:start position:0%
impossible
um

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
I mean is there anything else I can do
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
to help are there any other questions or
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
but I as as we walk as we just walk
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
through those those scenarios the Carol
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
scenario I think we're all in agreement
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong with that the
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
language about the other towns the other
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
pre-existing communities that's
 
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:10.340 align:start position:0%
irrelevant if if you get a a a
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
three-fifths super majority in the
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for me I don't actually read
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
it like that at all if you if you looked
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
at a paragraph three and it seems pretty
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
obvious to me that that one comma that
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
is currently before the word in is
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually supposed to be about six words
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
down before the word or
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that solves the issue here that
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear that there are two
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
methods not three to withdraw and that
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the case of Carol in this instance
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
the three third the two I'm sorry the
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
super majority against them and the
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
whole thing would actually prevent them
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
from being able to leave under this
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's a reasonable
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
so we passing over a misplaced comma is
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the point it
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
there's an episode of West Wing the toad
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
TV show where they they there's a in the
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the I believe isn't either the
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
takings clause or the Commerce Clause
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
they looked at the original they
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell if it was a comma or a
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
smudge of ink that would have changed
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the interpretation of provision of
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
the Constitution so just as an aside
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
what's while we're laughing over it
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
being a comma it has it it has important
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
the the issue that I see here is that
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is a possible remedy to these
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
which co-ops have been fighting now we
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
just talked about the Bridgewater
 
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.290 align:start position:0%
just talked about the Bridgewater
situation

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
one of the discussions in Newfound
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
school district is to change their
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
articles around so there's more emphasis
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
placed on property valuation
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why they can't do it is the
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
agreement they have with Bridgewater if
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
they change those articles of agreement
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
without mutual agreement on both sides
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater is out of that Co-op just
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
like that bang so they they they're
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
staying away from that so they're having
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they would love to see that happen
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
up there in Newfound seeing that you and
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
I know that Bridgewater is on newfound
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
Lake and the property valuations are
 
01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:35.689 align:start position:0%
Lake and the property valuations are
high

01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so I guess where I am is that
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
because all these articles of agreement
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
are so very different throughout this
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
state with different conditions in
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
how do we as a legislature change those
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
articles I don't think we can so it's
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
got to be done either through a
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
commission study to rewrite this whole
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
chapter of Law and then we're going to
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
deal with all the issues which makes it
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to do and come to
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
any senses a consensus of agreement or
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
we try to deal with this particular
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
singular issue how do you get out and
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do within
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
this bill for sure and if I could thank
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
you chairman if I could comment just to
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
sort of maybe help the committee there
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
are a couple different ways that that a
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
statute could be drafted
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
to I'm just going to say for lack of
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
better way of putting this we're making
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
it easier to withdraw from Cooperative
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
school district one option you could do
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
a simple majority vote within the town
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
looking to withdraw item nhsba does not
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that's necessarily prudent you
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
could have a a super majority within
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
that town and the remaining towns have
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
have no say nhsba does not think that's
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
proven as well too you could have a
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
super major you could have a simple
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
majority in the towns you can withdraw
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
that could be overruled by a
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
three-fifths negative in the remaining
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
towns you could do there I mean you
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
could do there are different ways that
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
this could be crafted I thought this you
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
know initially we thought this bill hit
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
that but in hearing the conversation
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
today there still seems to be some
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
confusion over interpretation and
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
placement of commas
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
so if many language were brought forth
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
would which would change the commas or
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
the necessary components of this bill to
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
reflect the intent that I think where
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to drive at and I hear you
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing would be something
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question chairman
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
loud a possible fix for the bill or a
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
possible fix for co-ops across the state
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
because a lot of co-ops are a possible
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
fix for both I mean I just I I don't
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
want to commit myself to anything
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd I hope you recognize and
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.550 align:start position:0%
understand that
um

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know as I initially read the bill
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
you needed and again I could be wrong if
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
I as I initially read the bill if you
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
have a majority Co-op if you have a
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
majority in the in the town seeking
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and majority Co-op wide the
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
withdrawal would go through the other
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
way I read it was that if you have a
 
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.070 align:start position:0%
way I read it was that if you have a
majority

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
in the pre-existing District seeking to
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
withdraw that could be overcome by a
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super majority Co-op wide
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
that was my initial interpretation of
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
foreign

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:30.130 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:37.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
again very very carefully and basically
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are two methods paragraph one
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
method and paragraph two method
 
01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
method and paragraph two method
as

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
um mayor Christina said
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
the three part is not another method
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's a if
 
01:19:01.209 --> 01:19:01.219 align:start position:0%
either one happens or two happens
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
then this is what this the instructions
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
what it what has to have you know it's
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
just the instructions then the state
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
will do this
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's not another method it's a that this
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
is what happens if either one or two
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
passes so as he said in one
 
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's a majority in two
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
three-fifths majority of the one unless
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's a three-fifths majority against
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
of the whole thing
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if either one of those passes that
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
was the or in there if either one of
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
those works
 
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.610 align:start position:0%
those works
then

01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
um it shall issue its certificate to
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that effect Etc then we talk about the
 
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.310 align:start position:0%
that effect Etc then we talk about the
process

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
so three is the process of what happens
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
if one or two makes it
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps I have read dry and then coming
 
01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:56.780 align:start position:0%
down representative
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay so then thank you Mr thank you
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
Barrett so that by my reading then Carol
 
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
would not be able to not be able to in
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
three so so my question would be what
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
does a small District do if they're
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
always outvoted by three-fifths of the
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative the rest of the Cooperative
 
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
Cooperative the rest of the Cooperative
right

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
try to change your articles of agreement
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
but that still needs the others to go I
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
I understand that that is part of the
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
age-old issue at Cooperative school
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
districts so if you're the small
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
District in there you're in there
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
you just screwed that's it
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
sorry I just what I was going to say
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
influenced by the previous two speakers
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
well I think what uh representative
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
Lakers just said about number three
 
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.370 align:start position:0%
Lakers just said about number three
being

01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
the next step after one or two happens
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
may be correct
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
but we have just spent an extended
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
period of time discussing what is
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
clearly quite
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh uncertain to many of us
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't seem like good
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislation to me if we can't figure
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
this out what does it say what does it
 
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.610 align:start position:0%
this out what does it say what does it
mean

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
our Cooperative school districts
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to figure it out and how to
 
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.430 align:start position:0%
supposed to figure it out and how to
proceed

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
I keep wondering if there's some way to
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
amend it in a almost instructive step
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
one step two step three this is what you
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
do if you want to try to withdraw from a
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
because it's just muddy
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
let me ask one other question of the
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
committee then is it worth
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
getting an amendment today
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
and moving the calm around or moving a
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
language around so
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
this thing works
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
represent luno Mr chair thanks and I
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um the the suggestion
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
there I think there's some very loose
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
language in here and that may be where
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
where this goes
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
um down the road but I would feel much
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
better if um
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
if 5 30 had um had more light a day
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
um from an input from uh from
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts in um in
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
you know as we craft State policy uh
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
with respect to withdrawals and I don't
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
think we need I don't think we
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to have a have a a
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission to study this but you know if
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
we were to hold over and work on it this
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
fall uh I think we could get uh get
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
something get something done that could
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know pass this committee with a
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
strong vote and um you know this is
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
policy that obviously affects I don't
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
know do co-ops teach more than half the
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
um students in the state
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's something close to that though I
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't have that information but I know
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
we have a whole boatload of co-ops what
 
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.790 align:start position:0%
we have a whole boatload of co-ops what
30

01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
how many towns within the co-ops total
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
loss up
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah for kids so it's about half the
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
kids so so you know I think if we can
 
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
well I'll just respond to that very
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
quickly I don't want to work on it like
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
we've done before and then come back and
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
itl bang you know if we're going to do
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
that we might as well do it yeah but if
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
if if we can if we're all in concurrence
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
here that there is a strong potential
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
that this can be made right
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the time that one appeal
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
took for Carol from November 2021 to
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
July 2022 that's just a time working
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
with the State Board through 15
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
different meetings
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
so obviously these school districts are
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
going through an awful lot of angst and
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of difficulty looking for some
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
kind of resolution to this
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I think it's incumbent upon us to
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
try to present something which is going
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
to help them out at least show them
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
where the bar is
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
represent leckis
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
well if this actually doesn't do
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
anything for Carol and other little
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
towns like that the way it's written now
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
then perhaps we should retain it so we
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
can come up with something that will
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
help those little towns because this
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to this doesn't seem to do
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
what we wanted it to do
 
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
okay what we're going to do right now
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to take about a five five
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
minute caucus we'll have the two groups
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
go caucus and we'll be coxing in this
 
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.250 align:start position:0%
go caucus and we'll be coxing in this
room

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:08.159 --> 01:43:06.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative Breville thank you Mr
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so this bill is enabling
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and so it would put the
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
question to the voters of the school
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
district whether or not they want to
 
01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
establish a local education Freedom
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
accounts and the the question that would
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
go on the ballot is defined in RSA it
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
requires a three-fifths super majority
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
to enable the program there is a safety
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
net for local school districts the
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
program can be repealed with a
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote so it's very similar
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
to going from traditional town meeting
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
to sb2 local form of government there is
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
a safety net for families in that if a
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
community chooses to discontinue the the
 
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
program the students that are already
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
enrolled would be able to see that
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
through uh for the the remainder of
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
their local education career it sets the
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh it sets the amount of the EFA
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
based uh it's pegged to the adequacy
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
Grant from the from the state and in
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
fact it's set at twice the adequacy
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
grant so uh under this bill the child
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
would be counted towards average daily
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
membership so that the local school
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
district would still get uh the local
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant for that child which
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
would then flow to the child plus a
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
matching Grant from uh from the local
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
school district so basically this is
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is putting the question to local
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
school districts whether or not they
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
want to allow a specified amount of
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
money to be able to follow students that
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
may find
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
what they perceive to be better
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities outside of the
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I see that there's still
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note on this do we have any
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
idea of what this will cost local school
 
01:45:09.239 --> 01:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
idea of what this will cost local school
districts

01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative reveal do you want to
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.770 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
representative

01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so the the cost per student is
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
defined uh in in the in the RSA uh if
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's adopted and it would be uh twice
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant uh the the adoption
 
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.729 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant uh the the adoption
rate

01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
um in any particular School District I I
 
01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:33.179 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody can predict that
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
although I would expect it to be a
 
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
fairly low adoption rate most people uh
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
want their children to attend the Local
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
District school because they want them
 
01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
to have that sense of of community they
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
they want to a tie to that Community but
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
that certainly isn't the best choice uh
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
for everyone there's further incentives
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
in that um transportation is guaranteed
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire k through eight if you
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
attend your local District school if you
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
participate uh in this program then you
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
lose the benefit of the free public
 
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.570 align:start position:0%
lose the benefit of the free public
transportation

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so it's another encouragement
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
um I I think most people I think most
 
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
fam families are quite satisfied with
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
their local District school so I would
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
expect that the adoption rate uh would
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
be would be very low
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni thank you
 
01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify there's no income
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions on this at all and it just
 
01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.530 align:start position:0%
restrictions on this at all and it just
and

01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
um if a student in say my district is
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
currently attending a private school
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
and would this money now be available
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
that my town would have to actually come
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
up with and pay for our towns portion
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
for that child to continue to go to the
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
private school that they're already at
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative reveal thank you
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so it's
 
01:47:00.970 --> 01:47:00.980 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion and I think it's widely
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
accepted with very few exceptions that
 
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
we do not means test public education in
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if we consider the town
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
that I live in Deerfield New Hampshire
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
if you move to Deerfield and Rule your
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
child in in the Deerfield community
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
school that's our local District school
 
01:47:22.129 --> 01:47:22.139 align:start position:0%
they do not ask you Mr Mrs burville uh
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
what's your annual salary so that we can
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
tell you what uh what amount is going to
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
be paid by taxpayer dollars and what you
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
would have to chip in I think that means
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
testing public education is antithetical
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the to the New Hampshire way and that
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
is why there are no income caps into
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
this into this program uh and and yes
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
there is there is no prohibition uh from
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
somebody that's currently in
 
01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a private school to
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
participate in this this program of
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
course they would have to go to their
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
local District school and enroll their
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
child into the district school to be
 
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
able to then Avail themselves of the
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
program if a community made such a
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
program available
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is yes
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
I know this is punched but it shall be
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
funded by The Local District and
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
I perceive this as districts and this is
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
common still occurs the district schools
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
have greater property evaluation from
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
more to their students
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
and we've been always trying to change
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
the formula to make something more
 
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.729 align:start position:0%
the formula to make something more
disability

01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide a balance
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for those districts
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah Define smoking versus those that
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't have enough fun as well
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
so I see it as a little bit biased
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
um because it goes down that road uh
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
a local
 
01:49:17.699 --> 01:49:21.669 align:start position:0%
a local
um

01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
at all the requirements for the adequate
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
education based on the property taxes
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's a very large community
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
the neighboring District can do it it
 
01:49:34.930 --> 01:49:34.940 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem like it's an
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
inequitable opportunity
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
you know they all should be able to get
 
01:49:41.209 --> 01:49:41.219 align:start position:0%
it through a mistake
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
or not get by communities because
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
they're just ads perhaps they're not
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
surprise representative verville yes
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate I I didn't really
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
get a question in there but I appreciate
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the comments what I would say is that
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
while we are a Dylan's rule state
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
we cherish
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
um local decision making right we we
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
cherish local control the only local
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
control our localities can have is the
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
permissions that we grant them and so is
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
this program the ideal program for every
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
school district in in the state
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I would I would guess
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
not because there is no one-size-fits
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
all that is the perfect solution for
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
every community
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
one of the most interesting things that
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
I learned in in the little over six
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
years that I've been a New Hampshire
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
State Rep is that we should not let uh
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
the perfect be the hobgoblin of the of
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
the good and so I believe that this this
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
bill allows local communities a little
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
bit more local control a little bit more
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
discretion in how they uh choose to
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
educate their the children of the
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
community and so for that reason I think
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
I think the bill is a good bill and I
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
think it for the communities where it
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
will work this will be a very good very
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
good option and for communities where
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work they simply don't need
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
to to adopt it
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thank you very much Mr
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
chair so you know first of all we know
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
means test
 
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
um uh people going to uh their public
 
01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:21.719 align:start position:0%
schools because the and it's not just a
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire way it's the New
 
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the New Hampshire
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that uh that every
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
municipality shall provide a um uh it
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
shall educate it all of its children
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
through public schools at no cost to um
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh to to those those children or their
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
families so so you know that's a that's
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit different here what we're
 
01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
doing is we're asking taxpayers
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
to um to not only you know continue to
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
fund their local schools but also here
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
you go here's some five or six grand of
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money a lot of people that's um
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's a pretty hefty
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
chunk of their local property taxpayer
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill but hold on go ahead and take this
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
and go pay your um your your private
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
school tuition bill with it so I'm I'm I
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
think um uh this is certainly going to
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
be a partisan bill I think it's going to
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
be great when um when Granite Staters
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and voters coming coming up in November
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
know exactly who is uh voted on the
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
floor for uh using uh taxpayer dollars
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
to pay private school tuition bills in
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
this case it's not taxpayer dollars
 
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
coming from business property tax
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and the
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
smattering of other taxes that are used
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
under the current voucher program to pay
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
those it's people's local property taxes
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
retirees local property taxes is people
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
living on fixed income their local
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes five six seven eight
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
grand of their local property taxes
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to pay um someone's private school
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
tuition bill going any private school
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
they want so um so a lot of them are you
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
know maybe going to you know for wealthy
 
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
family uh going to um you know Phillips
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
Exeter Phillips Andover St Paul's any of
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
these any of these schools and um um and
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
now they get um
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
a chunk of change from their retired
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor I think voters across
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are going to love hearing
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
about this I like to respond to that
 
01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.090 align:start position:0%
about this I like to respond to that
um

01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
this bill is not telling any any
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
District they have to do this or any
 
01:53:36.649 --> 01:53:36.659 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they have to do this
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
and when I heard representative Breville
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
right on Ward one almost he said this is
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation enabling
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
and I also heard him speak to local
 
01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:52.139 align:start position:0%
decision making it's local control so
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's not telling you're going to have to
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
do this you're gonna have to spend you
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
know your adequacy money and then and
 
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
match it with another dose of money from
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
you you're you're allowing school
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
districts to make that decision
 
01:54:03.119 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
districts to make that decision
themselves

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
if they don't like that idea they don't
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
do it but what we are doing excuse me I
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking right now
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
the the rationale behind this is that we
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
want the local decision making at the
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
local level we want to have the
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a local school board to
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
make the decision what is the best
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
Fit For A Child whether it be in their
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
local education public school program
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
which probably the vast vast majority
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
would say yes that's where I'm going to
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
and that was also mentioned by
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative reveal that there's a lot
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
of good social experiences and all to be
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
experienced by being in with the public
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
school with your community with your
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
neighbors Etc but there are some
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
situations that perhaps that's not the
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
best fit and so once again this is a
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
decision that's made locally at that
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
local board or Community says no we're
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
not going to do this then you don't do
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
it it's that simple representative
 
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.770 align:start position:0%
it it's that simple representative

01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I just wanted to follow up
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
on something because I had a small
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
question because I am obviously first
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
year in the education committee I'm
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the Court findings that
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
have impacted the way we do things but I
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
heard a quote that the New Hampshire
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that we shall fully
 
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
fund education strictly through public
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
um prep luno can you tell me where I
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
would find that at the New Hampshire
 
01:55:31.739 --> 01:55:33.890 align:start position:0%
would find that at the New Hampshire
Constitution

01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:43.129 align:start position:0%
thank you
through

01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
well until represent Luna finds a
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden just a question for
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
this group why why is there cherishing
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
local control for issues like this
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
but yet there's you want state
 
01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
government control for the issues and
 
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction that belong
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
because this involves local Monies
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the other involves State monies and
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
so local control for things that only
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the locals are paying for and State
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
control for the things that the state is
 
01:56:29.169 --> 01:56:29.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
reps and luno
 
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.350 align:start position:0%
reps and luno
so

01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
um so the the Supreme Court in Claremont
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh quoted in the quotes in their
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
decision quote we hold it part two
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
article 83 imposes a duty on the state
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
to provide a constitutionally adequate
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
education to every educatable child
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
educable child in the public schools in
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to guarantee adequate
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
funding that was Supreme Court decision
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
Claremont B Governor
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um and I assume that
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
was the PO that was the where they were
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
pointing to the New Hampshire
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution where the Constitution
 
01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
actually says we shall cherish education
 
01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't actually say in the
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we shall only fund
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
public education or rather Public
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative paternal thank you Mr
 
01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:32.990 align:start position:0%
representative paternal thank you Mr
chair

01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I think I heard that every
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
municipality shall provide an adequate
 
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
education for the students
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
but as a homeschooler
 
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:47.219 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:57:47.219 --> 01:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
one of the
um

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
struggles that I heard most often from
 
01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:51.950 align:start position:0%
struggles that I heard most often from
families

01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
who were trying to figure out what to do
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
with their students who are struggling
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
especially in our community their only
 
01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
option was maybe to homeschool and that
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
because there just isn't another place
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
locally to send their children
 
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.609 align:start position:0%
locally to send their children
and

01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I was hearing from those parents is
 
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.089 align:start position:0%
what I was hearing from those parents is
that

01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
there's their children were not being
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
provided adequate education for their
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
needs and they may not have fit into
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
special education profiles needing an
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
IEP or a 504. but they would have
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
been happier for their students their
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
students would have succeeded more had
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
they had an option like this and this
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
lick leaves
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
local control in place because the towns
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to vote first they have to decide
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
and you need I mean 25 people
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
it just it leaves it all in the hands of
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
the local voters and is doing what is
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
best for the parents and the students
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Breville
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it it's interesting that when we talk
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
about making money available to follow a
 
01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.169 align:start position:0%
about making money available to follow a
child

01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
that we quickly Chase to oh my goodness
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
we're subsidizing the rich
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
do you know who already has freedom of
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
school choice
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
those that are well off those that come
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
forward to pay their local property tax
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
to fund their local District school and
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
then also be able to afford to send
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
their child or children to a private
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
school of their choice
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
do you know who doesn't have that option
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
people of marginal means
 
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
people that don't make enough money to
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
what I've heard for a long time as a
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
citizen in New Hampshire
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
is it the adequacy grant
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
is inadequate
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
and that's a debate for another day
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
but if I take it on its face and I
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
concede the point and say correct the
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant is insufficient
 
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
then perhaps you have to Benchmark the
 
02:00:19.609 --> 02:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
amount to something
 
02:00:23.229 --> 02:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
so twice the adequacy imagine a family
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
of marginal means
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
having access to twice the adequacy
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
grant to be able to educate their
 
02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:33.189 align:start position:0%
grant to be able to educate their
children

02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
that's who would benefit from this
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
program if a local District chose to
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
enable it those are the real
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries the people of of high
 
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:46.070 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries the people of of high
means

02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
already have the money to be able to do
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
those things it's people of moderate
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
means that don't have access to it and
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
and the state EFA is a first great good
 
02:00:58.570 --> 02:00:58.580 align:start position:0%
fight at the Apple to get there right
 
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
and it's funny because at one time I
 
02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:02.750 align:start position:0%
and it's funny because at one time I
hear

02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
hear
 
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant is wholly
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
insufficient to adequately educate a
 
02:01:07.139 --> 02:01:08.209 align:start position:0%
insufficient to adequately educate a
child

02:01:08.209 --> 02:01:08.219 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
but then when I double the amount all of
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
a sudden I hear oh my goodness we're
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
just going to throw buckets of gold at
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
at Rich families and and I don't think
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
that that's correct this is a good faith
 
02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.410 align:start position:0%
that that's correct this is a good faith
effort

02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
to help the marginalized families
 
02:01:27.169 --> 02:01:27.179 align:start position:0%
financially marginalized families and
 
02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
students in this state to be able to get
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
a good education and I'll tell you what
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
if if double the adequacy grant allows a
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
poor child with financial aid from
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
Phillips Exeter Phillips Andover or any
 
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
other private school
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
to get the the education of their dreams
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
the education that best fits their needs
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
then I am all for that I am absolutely
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
all for that and it's hard to imagine
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
somebody would be against it
 
02:01:54.599 --> 02:01:56.089 align:start position:0%
somebody would be against it
so

02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
if we put it if we if we cap it if we
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
put a a an economy an income cap
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
right that's when we start pitting those
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
that have against those that have not
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
and where do you draw the line there's
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
always that family
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
that is just over where you set the cap
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
and they can't afford to do it on their
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
own and they don't have access to the
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
program because they're just above the
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
cap this is a great bill I look forward
 
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the house floor debate I look forward
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
to the roll call and I'm I'm glad that
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
that my partners on the other side of
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
the aisle are going to gonna participate
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
in that debate and participate in that
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
roll call so that we can decide what we
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
want to do here thank you Mr chairman
 
02:02:42.970 --> 02:02:42.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brian
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
um in in my town
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
we were statutorily allowed to give a
 
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
tax break to the local private high
 
02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:58.450 align:start position:0%
tax break to the local private high
school

02:02:58.450 --> 02:02:58.460 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
that is in town can be Union Academy by
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
um uh not taxing their dormitories and
 
02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.629 align:start position:0%
um uh not taxing their dormitories and
um

02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
dining Halls
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
there was a fund in Plainfield for high
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
school students who got into KOA by
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
passing their exam to divvy up to use
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
for tuition it saved Our Town a ton of
 
02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
money because we didn't have to pay
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
tuition fees for those students to go to
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
Lebanon High School so for a town that
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
you know has an area agreement or um
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
pays tuition to a high school this is an
 
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
option to save some money and provide a
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
really good opportunity that didn't
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
exist before
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
what we did in town was voted on it
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
every year whether we wanted to do it or
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
not and we had a study committee
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
appointed by the moderator who studied
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
the benefits and the non-benefits of the
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
program every year to in order to
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
present something at town meeting it was
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
under a microscope the whole time and it
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
lasted for a long long time I'm hoping
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
that a local District would would adopt
 
02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.219 align:start position:0%
similar things if they adopted these
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
programs I guess
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
um my question to you as writing the
 
02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
bill is uh what
 
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
happens when there are many scholarships
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
right now we have one scholarship
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization that monitors the efas but
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that many
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
different ones could be approved perhaps
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
so you would have Choice which one to to
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chairman yeah so
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
much of the language that's in this bill
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
mirror is the language that's in our
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
existing uh State EFA program uh to make
 
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
the the management of the programs that
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
much easier
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
um the state EFA allows for more than
 
02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
one scholarship organization should
 
02:05:04.729 --> 02:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
another choose to enter the space and
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill would certainly track with
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
that and and allow for more than one
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to be able to
 
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
manage uh these accounts to enter into
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
the space
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
yes so each family would be able to
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
choose which scholarship Association or
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
would a town all go with one
 
02:05:24.599 --> 02:05:27.290 align:start position:0%
would a town all go with one
organization

02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
may I guess go ahead thank you for the
 
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
may I guess go ahead thank you for the
question

02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
um it it's my understanding uh that the
 
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
family would would be able to choose
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
that organization that they would be
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
contracting with that organization to to
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
manage those to manage those funds
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cascadden
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
um not really a question but just want
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify the representatives
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
point on choice and the timing of
 
02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
point on choice and the timing of
everything

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
a parent has always had the choice of
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
how and where to educate their children
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
the dispute comes because now we are
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
asking for local property taxes to
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
provide that education so I just want to
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
be clear about that I didn't come from a
 
02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
wealthy family but my parents long
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
before you were born made the decision
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
to send me to private school
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
like many others so parents have a
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
choice they've had a choice make that
 
02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.689 align:start position:0%
choice they've had a choice make that
choice

02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
but it comes at a time where now we're
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
tapping public funds
 
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I appreciate
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
that and please know I I'm the product
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
of public education I went through
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
grades one through eight in in Pembroke
 
02:06:43.129 --> 02:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
where I grew up I went to Bishop Brady
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
High School my parents chose to send me
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
there I went to Plymouth state for my
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
undergrad and I'm a grad school dropout
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
out of out of two lanes so I've I've
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
been in a lot of those things I'm a
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
former High School science teacher I get
 
02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.089 align:start position:0%
former High School science teacher I get
it

02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
when you say families have the choice
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
not all families have the choice there
 
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
are a lot of families that simply don't
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
have the financial means
 
02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
to choose any other option other than
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
their local District school
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I I don't deny
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
my proclivity
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we don't means test public
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
education so the question is how do we
 
02:07:28.729 --> 02:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
Define public education right so this
 
02:07:28.739 --> 02:07:30.169 align:start position:0%
Define public education right so this
bill

02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
adopts my view of public education which
 
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
is the educating of children of a
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
community using Community funds taxpayer
 
02:07:37.739 --> 02:07:40.310 align:start position:0%
community using Community funds taxpayer
dollars

02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
there is a different school of thought
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
right that says that the taxpayer
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
dollars all have to go
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
to a local District school
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the that's the only path
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
for the vast majority of children
 
02:08:01.070 --> 02:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
but there's Exceptions there too right
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the most needy
 
02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
special ed students
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
get out of District placement
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
to go to special schools that can
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
appropriately meet their needs
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of them
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
are private institutions
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
we have communities that don't have a
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
school the district school of certain
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
grades in their community and so they
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
tuition their kids to other non-public
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
schools it's being done right this is
 
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
this is simply an expansion of those
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
types of opportunities
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
to to a community if they choose to do
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that and when we say we don't we don't
 
02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
let tax dollars flow to private schools
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
that you know that that's not it's not
 
02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
correct at the at the K through 12 in
 
02:08:57.050 --> 02:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's certainly
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that right it's certainly
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
not true once we talk about secondary
 
02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
education right you take your Pell Grant
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
you can take your federally subsidized
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
student loan and go to any school you
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
want private school religious school
 
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
wherever you wherever you're lucky
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
enough to get to get accepted
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I I understand the pause of making
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
this tax quote-unquote taxpayer money
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
available to families that already have
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
the means to support a district school
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
and a private school
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I get that it's kind of a rub but
 
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
but that's fair and Equitable that
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
everybody has the same access to the
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
same opportunities with the local money
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
and that's why I didn't put means
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
testing into this bill and that's why I
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
would oppose a a motion to to do that
 
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
this this bill really is designed and
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
intended for the families that don't
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
have the means that would like to make
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
another choice
 
02:09:55.129 --> 02:09:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Tanner
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I and this is just a comment
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're in we're not
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
in a question and answer period
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
um with public money goes accountability
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
and my whole issue
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
has been that the EFA and the children's
 
02:10:19.070 --> 02:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund with that money there
 
02:10:20.930 --> 02:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
isn't the accountability
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is discrimination that's going on
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
that that's against our
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws in the state
 
02:10:31.729 --> 02:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't as taxpayers
 
02:10:31.739 --> 02:10:33.290 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't as taxpayers
have

02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
the feedback and the oversight that we
 
02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
should have on how our money is being
 
02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:38.990 align:start position:0%
should have on how our money is being
spent

02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
nor a cap on how much money is being
 
02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:42.770 align:start position:0%
nor a cap on how much money is being
spent

02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
so um I can't vote for this bill
 
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
and that's my state
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
I'm glad the issue of accountability
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
came up because uh we need a little bit
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
more of that in the public education
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
don't we if you look at the achievement
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
scores which we have and if
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
accountability we're going to talk about
 
02:11:02.689 --> 02:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
that we have the same type of
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
accountability for you know everybody in
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
the state one test the state test well
 
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
that is that's not a good measure of
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
student uh performance or growth it may
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
give us some data but it does not
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily really speak to the holes
 
02:11:21.609 --> 02:11:21.619 align:start position:0%
and the strengths of a student
 
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
if we did something more Diagnostic in
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
nature it might help but so what we're
 
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
just doing we're complying with federal
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
law that's all we're doing so we can get
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
the confederal
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't mean we're holding anybody
 
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
accountable certainly because that's not
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
reflective of where we've been with our
 
02:11:37.570 --> 02:11:37.580 align:start position:0%
scores over the last decade
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
follow up because we just heard that
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some discrimination going
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
on in some of the current programs I
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
abhor the concept of discrimination hate
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
it don't like it anywhere
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I would ask if I can give one or two
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
examples recitations I would love to dig
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
into it and what I can find I will help
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
try to solve anything I can
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent miler well
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
we've really opened up a box of worms
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
here haven't we yes we have first of all
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
there is accountability
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's an elected countability
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
you have school boards that are elected
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
you've got school district meetings that
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
hold and uh
 
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
deal with budgets there's accountability
 
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
there if I send a check to a private
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
school I've got no accountability there
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
I forgot
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Belcher representative Belcher what
 
02:12:35.689 --> 02:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
did you just say please because I want
 
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
to respond oh discrimination yes
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
yes well documented
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
if I've got an lbgq child who I want to
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
have a Christian education
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
won't let me in there
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had in this committee We
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
Have Heard
 
02:12:56.209 --> 02:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
stories not stories but facts of a child
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
who was in Dover who was in a Christian
 
02:12:58.020 --> 02:12:58.970 align:start position:0%
who was in Dover who was in a Christian
School

02:12:58.970 --> 02:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
was about who was on track to be a
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
valedictorian and in this in his Junior
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
Summer going into a senior year
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
basically came out and said he was gay
 
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
guess what happened to him
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
he was not admitted next year he was
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
excluded because he happened to be an
 
02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
lbgq students so don't tell me that
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's not discrimination as it relates
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
to the application of these Monies
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
one area of accountability we haven't
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
talked about and I think it's the
 
02:13:32.330 --> 02:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
greatest accountability is the parent
 
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.530 align:start position:0%
greatest accountability is the parent
when

02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:13:35.530 --> 02:13:35.540 align:start position:0%
when you make the choice the decision
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
where you which what the child's going
 
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
to do it's going to be the parent
 
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
to do it's going to be the parent
working

02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and deciding what is the best situation
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
for my child and that's what we're
 
02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
talking about the the parent knows that
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
child best
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I I think that we can't lose sight
 
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
of that so when we talk accountability
 
02:13:59.810 --> 02:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
we need to also be talked about the
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
prime accountability individual and
 
02:14:03.169 --> 02:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
that's the parent
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent leckis
 
02:14:07.609 --> 02:14:07.619 align:start position:0%
there's also the accountability of how
 
02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
the money is spent and we really don't
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
have a lot of accountability when it
 
02:14:15.050 --> 02:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
comes to public schools and when it
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
comes to efas every penny every penny
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
has to be okayed that it is actually for
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
an educational purpose or that money
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't go out so there's extreme
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
accountability as far as that goes
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
and they still have to put an annual
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
report in just like your public school
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
does they still have their annual report
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um you
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
know I'll I'll be honest I'm pretty
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
disappointed in this committee's um
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
position when uh when it comes down to
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh Public School accountability as we
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
voted uh 10 10 no recommendation on
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
House Bill 371 last week which would
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
have established a legislative oversight
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
Commission on the um the the minimum
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
standards for public schools which are
 
02:15:12.010 --> 02:15:12.020 align:start position:0%
undergoing a unilateral
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
back room locked closet
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
um uh a rewrite the first draft of that
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
actually finally came out I think last
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
week uh just moments before the um
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
the um the draft went to the State Board
 
02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
of Education so so the vote out in this
 
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
committee was along party lines with uh
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
with all Democrats thinking it makes a
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to have a um uh a
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee on the
 
02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for school approval
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
and all Republicans on the committee
 
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
voting against it so um so let's let's
 
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:53.099 align:start position:0%
when we talked to the talk let's walk
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
the walk and um and that's that's that's
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
my my line on public school
 
02:16:01.129 --> 02:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
accountability and what what you've seen
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
come out of this committee
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to respond to that also
 
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
because that that's really not what the
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
we talked about at that on the committee
 
02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
we do have in place the legislative
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and a meeting has
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
been established to look at these
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
standards in fact the standards were
 
02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
brought up by the Legislative oversight
 
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee prior to
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
going back three or four months and now
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have another one yes we have received
 
02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
approval and immediately we have now
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
that meeting set up if we had gone the
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
route that you were asking for that that
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
particular commission committee wouldn't
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
even be on board until September
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
and we're losing mileage there so the
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee which is
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
tasked with a responsibility for looking
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
at academic standards academic state
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we put in well you can't tell me
 
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
that academic standards are not part of
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Public School the minimum
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
standards of public school approval they
 
02:17:05.089 --> 02:17:05.099 align:start position:0%
are different but they also are linked
 
02:17:06.889 --> 02:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
and they're both approved by the State
 
02:17:09.169 --> 02:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
Board of Education so you know the
 
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
intent and what they now if if that's
 
02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
where where you are we won't discuss
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
those things that the legislative
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee if that's what you
 
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:18.950 align:start position:0%
oversight committee if that's what you
want

02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
we won't do it
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
we'll just deal with academic standards
 
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's appropriate I
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate we look at both
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and uh to assess those to determine
 
02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
that those standards are reflective of
 
02:17:34.969 --> 02:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
the granite state that are reflective of
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
the needs we have the effective
 
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
reflective of what we the standards we
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
would want to put in place for the
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
approval of schools in this state so I I
 
02:17:46.610 --> 02:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know I disagree I think we're
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
talking process more we are that the
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
basic principles and concepts of the
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing we do have a good process in
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
place we don't need more committees and
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
more commissions we need the commissions
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
and the Committees we have doing their
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
jobs and and uh without having to
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
develop another Mega commission that has
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
more people on it that we have letters a
 
02:18:11.209 --> 02:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
represent Myler call the question yeah
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%

on this question I agree we need to call
 
02:18:20.519 --> 02:18:21.770 align:start position:0%

02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay last week I got that and then yeah
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay okay let's just take that break and
 
02:22:55.690 --> 02:22:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
02:23:09.889 --> 02:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah to do that it's just not in
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
its charge so it's it's going to be in
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
its charge
 
02:23:16.849 --> 02:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
you heard me many times talks about the
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
difference between academic and minimum
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I I feel it's a real
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
closeful relationship and that's what
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I wrote up three three I I I
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
I got that I was just looking at
 
02:23:31.849 --> 02:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
timeliness I think we need it right on
 
02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
and I went I don't I don't know if
 
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
you've gone through that trash copy I
 
02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
have I have to I got blue sticky notes
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.690 --> 02:24:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we we will do it then because I I
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
do have some sheets I've been looking at
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay if I could start and do a speech on
 
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
something that's perhaps a little less
 
02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
okay you'll probably do the speech and
 
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.439 --> 02:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.600 --> 03:48:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:55.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:48:55.570 --> 03:48:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.650 --> 03:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to set some rules up here
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
the latter part on some of these bills
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
where we're going to try to limit the
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
number of speakers
 
03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
so we can do it like we did the last day
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon there where we had one
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
speaker for each party
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
that might be a great idea to try to get
 
03:49:17.090 --> 03:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
on board with again
 
03:49:17.100 --> 03:49:18.290 align:start position:0%
on board with again
so

03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:18.300 --> 03:49:19.250 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
if we get by a certain hour here you
 
03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:23.090 align:start position:0%
if we get by a certain hour here you
know

03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
my exhaustion hour
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
which might be about 2 30. we might have
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one type discussion then vote
 
03:49:35.570 --> 03:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay so let's start out right now
 
03:49:37.370 --> 03:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep marching right down
 
03:49:38.630 --> 03:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
where we were I'm not going to go back
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the top I'm going to do 539 first
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
539 deals for vaccination clinics in
 
03:49:44.399 --> 03:49:45.950 align:start position:0%
539 deals for vaccination clinics in
schools

03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:49:48.769 --> 03:49:48.779 align:start position:0%
and I call upon represent
 
03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
Belcher for a motion
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would move ought to
 
03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second
 
03:50:00.650 --> 03:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
second represent Ford Sacrament so it's
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
made by Belcher second by Ford
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher uh do you would you
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak your motion yes and uh
 
03:50:10.610 --> 03:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
shall I introduce the amendment that I
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
have now or should I wait on that no you
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
should go ahead and introduce your
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
excellent I would like to introduce uh
 
03:50:19.630 --> 03:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
rep cordelli's Amendment
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
2023-0706h very small Amendment um it
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
changes the timeline on the original
 
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill for which uh these vaccination
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
clinics would be prohibited schools
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
from the original two-hour timeline down
 
03:50:36.769 --> 03:50:36.779 align:start position:0%
to a one hour timeline this is done in
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
order to provide schools with more
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
latitude and ability to conduct vaccine
 
03:50:44.690 --> 03:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
clinics on their location while still
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
allowing students that are not to be
 
03:50:49.490 --> 03:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
partaking time to make sure that they're
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
no longer just kind of hanging around
 
03:50:53.330 --> 03:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
school and accidentally possibly get
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
um as to the underlying Bill itself we
 
03:51:01.490 --> 03:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
heard a fair bit of testimony on this
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
bill and we heard
 
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and we saw a documentation that at
 
03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
least two New Hampshire students were
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated without consent in New
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in recent time and one
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
explicitly against parent wishes we even
 
03:51:20.570 --> 03:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
saw the documentation that said do not
 
03:51:23.290 --> 03:51:23.300 align:start position:0%
vaccinate but they received it anyway
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
and then we went on to hear also from if
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken the Department of
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
03:51:33.410 --> 03:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
that these vaccine clinics are something
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we conduct under Federal auspices
 
03:51:40.849 --> 03:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
in order to satisfy our requirements as
 
03:51:43.849 --> 03:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
a state for certification in various
 
03:51:46.370 --> 03:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
mass casualty and bio Warfare
 
03:51:46.380 --> 03:51:48.950 align:start position:0%
mass casualty and bio Warfare
certifications

03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
03:51:48.960 --> 03:51:49.729 align:start position:0%
certifications
um

03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:51.530 --> 03:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
we do these things in order to
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.490 --> 03:51:57.500 align:start position:0%
um rather we don't obviously we do the
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinate the students but we also at
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
the same time do them to check that
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
Federal box
 
03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to go on record here and
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
saying that we when we obviously have
 
03:52:10.729 --> 03:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
shown the inability
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have zero errors in a program like
 
03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
this should not be complicating Matters
 
03:52:21.769 --> 03:52:21.779 align:start position:0%
by trying to
 
03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
double up our efforts to check Federal
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
boxes and do all these other things
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
while we're also vaccinating children
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
because that seems like it's going to
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
add complications and more problems to
 
03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing beyond that it's um a
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
lot of parents came to me a lot of
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
parents sent me emails they said they
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
are uncomfortable a lot of them have
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
said they've held their children out of
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
school on days when they've heard these
 
03:52:48.650 --> 03:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
things may be going on because they're
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
afraid they may accidentally get swept
 
03:52:52.809 --> 03:52:52.819 align:start position:0%
up in these programs now this isn't some
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxxer nonsense I don't think
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
anybody here doesn't want children to
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
get the vaccines they need to get so
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
long as they have parental informed
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
consent that's not what this is about
 
03:53:05.809 --> 03:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's just about being safe and making
 
03:53:08.510 --> 03:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
sure we're not accidentally
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
giving children vaccines that they have
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
not received affirmative and informed
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
consent from their parents for thanks
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
represent Ford used second the motion do
 
03:53:24.050 --> 03:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
03:53:28.490 --> 03:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell so I'd just
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
like to quote someone from the last bill
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about that said we
 
03:53:35.929 --> 03:53:35.939 align:start position:0%
cherish local control and I think this
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
is a local decision that's that's best
 
03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
met that would that the just local
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
Local District can decide what best
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of their Community you
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
know there are you can say an hour but
 
03:53:52.370 --> 03:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
students that go home on a bus whose
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
parents don't have a car don't have
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
means of transportation aren't going to
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
be able to get them back to school to
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
get that vaccination so I I think it I
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
think it's horrible that two people two
 
03:54:07.729 --> 03:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
children were vaccinated by mistake and
 
03:54:10.490 --> 03:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
I think that there can be more controls
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
put in to make sure that that never
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
happens again but I I think that if if
 
03:54:18.410 --> 03:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester wants you decide to have
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics at the schools that
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
should be a Manchester decision and I
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't think there should be the rest of
 
03:54:26.689 --> 03:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
the state should be making that decision

04:01:58.560 --> 04:01:59.650 align:start position:0%
um retaining this because I don't
believe

04:01:59.650 --> 04:01:59.660 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
raising the income threshold is
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
something that um that that you know
 
04:02:07.849 --> 04:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
expansion of the program is um
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
is is warranted right now particularly
 
04:02:12.889 --> 04:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
that um that that the program hasn't
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
even been subject to I think the
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
performance audit that's coming up this
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%

04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you Mr chair I I think
 
04:07:21.650 --> 04:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
there's a couple significant issues that
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
come up with this bill the first of
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
which being that the federal guidelines
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement in this program are
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
set at I believe 185 percent we're
 
04:07:31.849 --> 04:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
easing at the 300 percent we put the
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
rest of that burden on the uh New
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers directly and in
 
04:07:41.450 --> 04:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
particular it calls for drawing this
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund which is
 
04:07:46.250 --> 04:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
another strain on public education
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars that we've heard so much about
 
04:07:48.000 --> 04:07:49.790 align:start position:0%
dollars that we've heard so much about
recently

04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
um another issue that it brings up is
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
that it would require Stu schools that
 
04:07:56.750 --> 04:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
do not currently participate in this
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
Federal program to do so which some
 
04:08:02.210 --> 04:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
schools have other options that they are
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
currently attending to and I don't think
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for us to be um
 
04:08:08.090 --> 04:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
attempting to override that when they
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
already have something in place
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.150 --> 04:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Riley
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
the committee has before a proposed
 
04:08:20.040 --> 04:08:21.229 align:start position:0%
the committee has before a proposed
amendment

04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
and would it be appropriate for
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Allison to at least
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
review the amendment or representative
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hall to review the amendment so at least
 
04:08:32.570 --> 04:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
we know what the parameters are of the
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
conversation here sure I have no
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
objection to that representative Allison
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh the amendment does
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
just two things uh one is that it
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
specifies the uh specific source of
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
funds that would be used to pay for the
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional meals and two it changes the
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
effective date from July 1 or 60 days
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
after that much in that to September 1st
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
of 23. uh that's basically those are the
 
04:09:09.769 --> 04:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
two changes on the amendment uh in terms
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the the bill itself uh we've gone
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
over and over and over this uh we feel
 
04:09:18.590 --> 04:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
strongly that one of the best one of the
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
things that needs to be done is that
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
hungry kids in New Hampshire who go to
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
school need to be fed
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
and that is a responsibility on this
 
04:09:30.729 --> 04:09:30.739 align:start position:0%
side uh that we we feel strongly about
 
04:09:35.090 --> 04:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of the uh 300 percent which is
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
the bill raises uh
 
04:09:41.210 --> 04:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
the eligibility to 300 percent of of
 
04:09:41.220 --> 04:09:43.070 align:start position:0%
the eligibility to 300 percent of of
poverty

04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
300 seems to be a a common
 
04:09:50.210 --> 04:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
number here in terms of lots of bills
 
04:09:53.090 --> 04:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
that 300 percent uh we move people up
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
because they need to have some
 
04:09:57.530 --> 04:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
assistance and we've been doing that uh
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we're right that 300 percent is right
 
04:10:01.490 --> 04:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
in line with what the committee's been
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
going forward with uh having said that
 
04:10:08.929 --> 04:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh I would I'm sure that we would not
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
object to uh
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
the committee if they wanted to move it
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
to 350 percent as we have looked for
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
were redone we we'd have no objection on
 
04:10:21.410 --> 04:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
this side in terms of uh moving at the
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
350 percent
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh
 
04:10:28.750 --> 04:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
this is a very very very important issue
 
04:10:32.450 --> 04:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
it it is involved with
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we provide to our kids and we've
 
04:10:36.889 --> 04:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
gone over debate after debate after
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
debate about what happens in school when
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
kids are hungry how they can't learn uh
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
how their their grade point average is
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
drop uh they have more discipline
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
problems I don't think the research on
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
this is is is is really uh disputable
 
04:10:58.250 --> 04:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
some people might want to do that but I
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
doubt it very much to have a discussion
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
over whether hungry kids learn better
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
than than kids who are offender the
 
04:11:10.250 --> 04:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
other way around uh so we're more that's
 
04:11:14.450 --> 04:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
the essence of the amendment uh and
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much it's pretty much encompasses
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
the bill as well
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent Hall
 
04:11:24.110 --> 04:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um recently in the online I wrote a
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
quote from a member of this committee
 
04:11:32.150 --> 04:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
who said and included myself that some
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the folks on this committee do not
 
04:11:35.570 --> 04:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
support kids
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I took that personally and I thought
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
I've supported kids my whole life
 
04:11:43.849 --> 04:11:43.859 align:start position:0%
and food insecurity doesn't exist in
 
04:11:43.859 --> 04:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
and food insecurity doesn't exist in
isolation

04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
we you know talk about the cost of
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
housing utilities Transportation this is
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
putting tremendous stress on families so
 
04:11:55.550 --> 04:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
if you really care about kids we want
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
kids to go to school and School meals
 
04:12:02.210 --> 04:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
are important as representative Ellison
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
said childhood hunger should not be it
 
04:12:07.250 --> 04:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
should be a non-issue in New Hampshire
 
04:12:12.110 --> 04:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I would say this should not be uh it
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
should be bipartisan we should be
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
supporting kids feeding them so that
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can learn
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
remember we're discussing the the motion
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
is itl we have this amendment that we're
 
04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
just talking about right
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
if we don't feed the kids you
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
if we don't feed the kids and then we
 
04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
assess the kids what we have is garbage
 
04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
for data
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
you don't fail to feed the football team
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
and then complain because they lose the
 
04:12:49.859 --> 04:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
and then complain because they lose the
games

04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
games
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
you can't do that it's not fair it's not
 
04:12:53.880 --> 04:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
you can't do that it's not fair it's not
logical

04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
logical
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
if you want people to perform at their
 
04:13:00.410 --> 04:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
best you can't ask them to do it when
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
they're hungry
 
04:13:03.650 --> 04:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
you say oh the parents are supposed to
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
do it I'm not here to talk about what
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
parents should or shouldn't do and this
 
04:13:12.170 --> 04:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
bill won't correct that
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why I support it
 
04:13:20.330 --> 04:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
I support it because it helps us
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we're ostensibly setting
 
04:13:26.150 --> 04:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
out to do is it the perfect solution no
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
it may be a necessary solution until we
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
achieve that whatever state it is where
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
the parents can do it
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think the parents myself being a
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
parent having sent kids to school I
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't think they choose not to feed
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
their kids
 
04:13:51.769 --> 04:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
but for whatever reasons they can't
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't whatever
 
04:13:56.929 --> 04:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
and in that case I think if we want to
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a school system and we want the
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
data we collect about the performance of
 
04:14:03.889 --> 04:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
that system in which we invest quite a
 
04:14:06.650 --> 04:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
then we ought to at least make it so the
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
measurement is Meaningful
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
because it's very easy to invalidate as
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
soon as you say the kids are starving
 
04:14:17.809 --> 04:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
well that's overstaying it but they're
 
04:14:17.819 --> 04:14:19.849 align:start position:0%
well that's overstaying it but they're
hungry

04:14:19.849 --> 04:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
represent Luna
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
oh represent mileage did you have your
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
hand all of a sudden
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay I I do have a concern um the
 
04:14:33.229 --> 04:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
federal government says it's 185 for the
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
free and reduced and 130 for the free
 
04:14:39.889 --> 04:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
why is it that the federal government
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't upped the ante in terms of their
 
04:14:42.239 --> 04:14:43.849 align:start position:0%
hasn't upped the ante in terms of their
responsibility

04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:14:46.250 --> 04:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
and moved it up to that 300 when you
 
04:14:48.050 --> 04:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
talk about 300 for other programs those
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
are State programs this is a federal
 
04:14:53.150 --> 04:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
program and we are seeing reimbursement
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
at 185.
 
04:14:55.439 --> 04:14:56.510 align:start position:0%
at 185.
um

04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:59.689 --> 04:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
so uh are we now going to say the
 
04:15:02.090 --> 04:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
state's going to have to cough in and
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
and and and pay for what the federal
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
maybe should be doing
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I I guess my concerns rest with that
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the funding support
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
for a program which basically is a
 
04:15:21.290 --> 04:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
federally reimbursed program
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
we want to go to 300 perhaps the federal
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
government should go 300. further
 
04:15:26.160 --> 04:15:27.469 align:start position:0%
government should go 300. further
discussion

04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Belcher
 
04:15:31.490 --> 04:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I won't belabor this
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
very long but I just to get to the heart
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
of this we're dealing with a little bit
 
04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
of an ethical issue here who has a
 
04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
responsibility to feed children and if
 
04:15:40.610 --> 04:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
we were just speaking for myself if we
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
were just talking about a doing a state
 
04:15:44.150 --> 04:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
program here and wanting to feed kids
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
that would be a lot easier to get me on
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
board than expanding and solidifying our
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
participation in a federal program that
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
comes with Federal strings and federal
 
04:15:59.210 --> 04:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
requirements so if if in the future
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to introduce a bill that
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
moves us toward a new hampshire-based
 
04:16:03.359 --> 04:16:04.250 align:start position:0%
moves us toward a new hampshire-based
model

04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk to you about that but
 
04:16:08.530 --> 04:16:08.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested in this Federal stuff
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and um Cheryl I was going to
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
wait not speak but I have to speak
 
04:16:16.080 --> 04:16:16.849 align:start position:0%
wait not speak but I have to speak
um

04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
first thing I I Mike has a point but the
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the reality is the federal money if you
 
04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
we just bypass it we don't get any money
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
for zero to 130 so that's I mean that's
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars are giving away
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that this is this bill
 
04:16:36.250 --> 04:16:36.260 align:start position:0%
is probably one of the most
 
04:16:38.150 --> 04:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
transformative bills we've had in the
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
six years I've been here efas efas is a
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
transformative bill
 
04:16:45.650 --> 04:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
you folks who supported that when you
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
walk away from this whenever you're done
 
04:16:48.650 --> 04:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
you can say wow that's what I do for
 
04:16:50.809 --> 04:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
Education this is exactly the same thing
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
except this transformed into 160 000
 
04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
kids population in the school this
 
04:16:58.610 --> 04:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
community this state
 
04:17:01.370 --> 04:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
this summer Oliver excuse me brother
 
04:17:05.150 --> 04:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
though Ford and Lucas and I and Mullen
 
04:17:09.410 --> 04:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
and Paul and Allison sat for hours and
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
in the fall listening to the Heart
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
Association doing Hampshire Solutions 68
 
04:17:16.610 --> 04:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
hours of hunger all kinds of anecdotal
 
04:17:19.250 --> 04:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
information over and over again this is
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
not a interim study committee that met
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
for a half an hour had a beer went home
 
04:17:24.170 --> 04:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
these people worked and looked at dad
 
04:17:25.610 --> 04:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
and looked at that and looked at data
 
04:17:28.010 --> 04:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
there is no question about that I sat on
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
a delegation it was representative
 
04:17:33.130 --> 04:17:33.140 align:start position:0%
personal and Belcher and Cordelia myself
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
voted for a gift to a local wolfborough
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
for five thousand dollars for 58 hours
 
04:17:41.570 --> 04:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
of hunger everyone voted yes no one
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
asked of a limited income who needed who
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
did it we knew the kids needed the food
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
you just can't back off on that uh and
 
04:17:50.689 --> 04:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
so I want to make sure earlier Robinson
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
Cordell is not here unfortunately but I
 
04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
will mention him we're going to stay
 
04:17:55.010 --> 04:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
downstairs last week it's about the
 
04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
children it's about the children hell
 
04:17:57.530 --> 04:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
he's banging his hand it's about the
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
children that's the best what this is
 
04:18:02.570 --> 04:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is about the children
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
us older people not the younger ones Mr
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
President McDonald may have never heard
 
04:18:08.090 --> 04:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
of Demi but all of us been involved with
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
tqm have heard of Deming and it says he
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
says one of the things that tqm is the
 
04:18:15.530 --> 04:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the community well
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is the responsibility Community the
 
04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
educational Community if you believe in
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
what we're doing this is the
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the education
 
04:18:21.960 --> 04:18:23.990 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the education
community

04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
I heard the representative talk about
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
families of marginalized need these are
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
families the Modern Life need when we
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
look at the covid money that came down
 
04:18:34.490 --> 04:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
and when they fed youngsters across the
 
04:18:37.490 --> 04:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
district everyone and now we talk to
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
those schools who are the kids that
 
04:18:41.330 --> 04:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
aren't getting fed so give them my July
 
04:18:43.250 --> 04:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
needs of no income or lower who are out
 
04:18:45.170 --> 04:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
of that Gap that's who Mike getting said
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
those folks are struggling the zero
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
three hundred and zero 185 are getting
 
04:18:49.199 --> 04:18:50.030 align:start position:0%
three hundred and zero 185 are getting
that

04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah we do need this it's going to be
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
if you pass the amendment I'm switching
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
against the IPL but basically all the
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
same information you pass the amendment
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
after the member representative
 
04:19:02.689 --> 04:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
Ellison's Amendment talks about putting
 
04:19:04.250 --> 04:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
this educational trust fund because this
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
is one of the most critical things we've
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
done here this is transformational this
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
is the buck what we do this is the
 
04:19:12.110 --> 04:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
Baseline so I asked if you vote against
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
the itl vote for the OTP a is revenue
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
Ford did and stand up one time for our
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire kids give them the
 
04:19:20.450 --> 04:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
Baseline it's hell of the hungry they'd
 
04:19:21.769 --> 04:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
have no place to sleep they can't eat
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
they're not going anywhere I don't care
 
04:19:24.769 --> 04:19:24.779 align:start position:0%
what test you put in front of them what
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
book what person what math the matter is
 
04:19:28.490 --> 04:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
not going to matter
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you president-eleven thank you
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask what happened when the
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
federal government when we put idea into
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
place and they said we're going to give
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
you 40 of the cause
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're down to 16 now who's paying that
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
other difference now
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
um see I I I understand the the the the
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill and I understand
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
that there are certain responsibilities
 
04:19:57.769 --> 04:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
which parents do have themselves
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
for their children
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
um but I don't understand why the state
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
is going to say well we're gonna we're
 
04:20:06.530 --> 04:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
gonna now pick up something that's
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
really part of this Federal program and
 
04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh I then you have run into the issue of
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
well okay now which of these students
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
now it's going to be more administrative
 
04:20:19.250 --> 04:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
costs figure out which one to comply
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
with 185 or less so that we can get the
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
federal component there but the ones
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
which are 186 or more uh we're gonna
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
have to break that out and pay fully for
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
that that's how I see it because there's
 
04:20:34.189 --> 04:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to be some reimbursement for part
 
04:20:38.290 --> 04:20:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're still we still go to the 186 and
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
Below we know that and and I agree with
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
you that the idea how about special
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
education money I agree there the
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
extended.com they have it what about
 
04:20:52.010 --> 04:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
retire in our state the state was going
 
04:20:53.090 --> 04:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
to the state was going to help every
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
local town and they didn't
 
04:20:56.809 --> 04:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
all right so I mean everybody backs off
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
but the reason we're going to do this we
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
should do this because this New
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids New Hampshire money and
 
04:21:04.370 --> 04:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
we have responsibility
 
04:21:05.570 --> 04:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't care if the federal
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
government's not paying Ida as regards
 
04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
to this matter
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Damon
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think this is an extremely important
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
and also extremely cost effective build
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
what School meals provide in the
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
nutrition composition for what they cost
 
04:21:27.769 --> 04:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
is actually pretty amazing
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
they're not perfect but they're very
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
very good in
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
the amount of protein the amount of
 
04:21:38.809 --> 04:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
nutrients the ability to help the brain
 
04:21:39.889 --> 04:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
work better
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
one of the landmark pieces of research
 
04:21:45.530 --> 04:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
in my field as a dietitian is the Iowa
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
breakfast study which was done in 1949
 
04:21:50.290 --> 04:21:50.300 align:start position:0%
and it's been
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
reiterated and re-assessed
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
countless times over those decades
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
and concisely put it very very clearly
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
showed that people who are fed breakfast
 
04:22:07.250 --> 04:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
have much better intellectual capacity
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
cognitive function mid to late morning
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
and through the day than people who are
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
not fed
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
honestly I think this is a no-brainer I
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
do not understand why we wouldn't feed
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
the kids representative Breville
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:22:25.490 --> 04:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
so I I don't necessarily disagree with
 
04:22:25.500 --> 04:22:27.349 align:start position:0%
so I I don't necessarily disagree with
you

04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I also get hung up
 
04:22:31.610 --> 04:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
because on the federal program
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
you have to take the balanced meal you
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
have to take it all you don't like the
 
04:22:37.729 --> 04:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
green beans get the green beans and the
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
green beans come up in the trash right
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not really whatever the food
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
item is right so when you're forcing
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
children because that's what the federal
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
program does because it it wants you to
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
have the balanced meal in a lot of
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
school districts it has greatly
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
increased the solid waste costs because
 
04:22:58.849 --> 04:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
of food that's getting thrown into the
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
barrel because that's not what kids want
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
for breakfast
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
I am fully on board
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
with feeding kids the problem with the
 
04:23:11.950 --> 04:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
federal programs are the it's a top-down
 
04:23:15.290 --> 04:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all type of model that has
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of flaws and for that reason I
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
would go uh with the upper the other
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative and say if if we want to
 
04:23:24.650 --> 04:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
do this for New Hampshire kids
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's a lot of cause it
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
should be a New Hampshire program so
 
04:23:32.809 --> 04:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
that we squeeze waste out of the system
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
because right now the way a system is
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
designed where we're generating food
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
waste so kids can can pick the little
 
04:23:43.490 --> 04:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
bit that they want and and for me that
 
04:23:45.530 --> 04:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's a high burden
 
04:23:47.090 --> 04:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's awesome
 
04:23:47.100 --> 04:23:49.490 align:start position:0%
that's awesome
sure

04:23:49.490 --> 04:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:23:49.500 --> 04:23:51.349 align:start position:0%
sure
so

04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Federal School meals program
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
s have been revised a number of times
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
over the years and to be frank with
 
04:23:58.439 --> 04:23:59.570 align:start position:0%
over the years and to be frank with
respect

04:23:59.570 --> 04:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
respect
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you're completely up to
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
date on what's served there's actually a
 
04:24:04.370 --> 04:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
lot more flexibility in it now than
 
04:24:06.110 --> 04:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
there used to be
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
and in schools where kids do
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
a waste Assessment program the kids
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
collect and Whey and tally and do it as
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
a science and math experiment what's
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
happening with the amount of waste from
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
their School meals
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
the waist goes way down they assess it
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
and they understand to do it better
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should vote against
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
this bill for that reason
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes gretson Woodcock just responded to
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker
 
04:24:37.319 --> 04:24:39.530 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker
um

04:24:39.530 --> 04:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I agree representative Damon uh
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
because she's the most knowledgeable in
 
04:24:44.689 --> 04:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
this Committee of anyone nutrition and
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
diet work that being said
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
I would rather have a little waste and
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
feed those folks from 180 to 300 they
 
04:24:56.510 --> 04:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
give them nothing to eat
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what you're saying give
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to eat because I don't want to
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
I'm saying Fairfield
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
just to be clear
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
that is not what I'm saying that is
 
04:25:11.929 --> 04:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely not what I'm saying
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
any school district can choose to fund
 
04:25:18.050 --> 04:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
any food program that it wants to fund
 
04:25:19.370 --> 04:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
in its District
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is increasing
 
04:25:25.490 --> 04:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
the state mandate on all schools all
 
04:25:27.769 --> 04:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
public schools about what they shall do
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
relative to serving food and so with all
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
due respect representative we can have a
 
04:25:34.130 --> 04:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion but I would
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you would not
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
mischaracterize the position that I'm
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
trying to articulate thank you Mr Jim
 
04:25:41.399 --> 04:25:44.210 align:start position:0%
trying to articulate thank you Mr Jim
welcome

04:25:44.210 --> 04:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
I do have one other question if in fact
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
you are like some communities which we
 
04:25:52.250 --> 04:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
know that are serving programs which are
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
not the federal program they're serving
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
their own nutritious meals is this
 
04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.010 --> 04:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
person Belcher
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
if I made from the way that I read the
 
04:26:08.090 --> 04:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
bill it does look like it's reimbursable
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
but not in their current programs it
 
04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
would force them onto the federal school
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
you make a great point there are there
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
are five schools in the state as soon as
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
another War six is five now but that's
 
04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
right we we went to the answer of study
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
there's five now um but that's not the
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
point you're absolutely right Rick and I
 
04:26:28.849 --> 04:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that answer
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
um if they would be able to participate
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh for the ones above the state money I
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't know that and that's a great
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
that's a great question but they we
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
clearly there'd be a lot we wouldn't
 
04:26:40.729 --> 04:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
force it on them they don't take it at
 
04:26:43.250 --> 04:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
now I mean the amendment which is what
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about took all
 
04:26:47.450 --> 04:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
those extraneous pieces out of there so
 
04:26:49.010 --> 04:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
just the schools that are participating
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
they could I think it would be eligible
 
04:26:51.410 --> 04:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's probably like concerned but you're
 
04:26:53.689 --> 04:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
right that five is a question
 
04:26:56.570 --> 04:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
okay you have one last comment represent
 
04:26:56.580 --> 04:27:04.969 align:start position:0%
okay you have one last comment represent
Damon

04:27:04.969 --> 04:27:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so
 
04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the amendment but the
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
paragraph I'm looking at in um Roman
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
numeral number one is the same as the
 
04:27:16.490 --> 04:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
it does not require the federal program
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
so if we're getting stuck on that that's
 
04:27:25.130 --> 04:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
not part of the spill
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
it says to make the meals available
 
04:27:30.889 --> 04:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education style
 
04:27:34.849 --> 04:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
established ensure compliance with this
 
04:27:37.610 --> 04:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
section I'm on line 10 and 11 and shall
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
establish minimum nutritional standards
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
for such meals as well as income
 
04:27:43.490 --> 04:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
guidelines Etc et cetera it does not
 
04:27:46.610 --> 04:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
mandate the federal programs
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
this bill also speaks to the eligibility
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for free and reduced meals
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
that is the federal program
 
04:27:56.450 --> 04:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
so I I think that what you're saying is
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
and not really giving us that the
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
specific information which is in this
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill we are talking about the federal
 
04:28:02.159 --> 04:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
bill we are talking about the federal
program

04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.050 --> 04:28:08.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.060 --> 04:28:09.729 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:28:09.729 --> 04:28:09.739 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:28:12.540 --> 04:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
again

04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:28:17.450 --> 04:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
does this apply to Charter Schools and
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
is it are these schools eligible for the
 
04:28:22.610 --> 04:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
waiver that's in the rest of section 189
 
04:28:22.620 --> 04:28:31.309 align:start position:0%
waiver that's in the rest of section 189
11a

04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.530 --> 04:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay Madam Kirk we have a motion on the
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
do you ever
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
have a clarification that we are that we
 
04:28:52.010 --> 04:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
would just asking questions or making
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
comments on the bill and not the
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
amendment is that correct that's correct

okay so we're going to address that

04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
04:31:35.710 --> 04:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock no thank you
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
yes my question is on part two section
 
04:31:46.800 --> 04:31:48.769 align:start position:0%
yes my question is on part two section
one

04:31:48.769 --> 04:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
which line starting in line 22 or 24.
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm in the introductory paragraph of
 
04:32:01.610 --> 04:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
RSA 19839
 
04:32:04.330 --> 04:32:04.340 align:start position:0%
one to read as follows
 
04:32:08.410 --> 04:32:08.420 align:start position:0%
and I realize that you're adding in
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
disbursements for School meals but what
 
04:32:13.849 --> 04:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
is not in there
 
04:32:13.859 --> 04:32:15.229 align:start position:0%
is not in there
um

04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
EFA is amongst other things
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
we had a bill to
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
collect up all of the extra things and I
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
am not sure what happens having
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
collected up those extra things if we
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
then pass a bill because usually it's
 
04:32:34.130 --> 04:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
the second bill
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's the later bill that takes
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
precedence and this would be the later
 
04:32:45.370 --> 04:32:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes yeah
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
um I I think this brings up a a good
 
04:32:53.090 --> 04:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
point particular for newer members but
 
04:32:55.849 --> 04:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
oftentimes legislative Services
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
um sees different bills that come
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
through that may amend different parts
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
of something and then during the
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled Bill process uh well actually
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's prior to the enrolled Bill process
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
legislative Services Smooths out those
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
those things isn't that correct Mr chair
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
so will the things that we
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
last week
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
go in in spider
 
04:33:25.320 --> 04:33:37.429 align:start position:0%
go in in spider
this

04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.090 --> 04:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
you bring up a good point and
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
I think that's something which would
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
have to be checked with
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
OLS I've had this go around with them
 
04:33:47.879 --> 04:33:49.310 align:start position:0%
OLS I've had this go around with them
before

04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
and they have come down and looked at
 
04:33:54.410 --> 04:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
the most recent legislation which
 
04:33:56.449 --> 04:33:56.459 align:start position:0%
superseded the legislation that had been
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
written prior to
 
04:34:01.369 --> 04:34:01.379 align:start position:0%
if they're on similar topic which is
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is on the same topic I mean this
 
04:34:05.810 --> 04:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
section right here
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time I will call a
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
recess and trying to get some
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarification on this
 
04:34:12.480 --> 04:34:14.570 align:start position:0%
clarification on this
and

04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
LL Beans at the other side of the
 
04:34:19.799 --> 04:34:22.789 align:start position:0%
LL Beans at the other side of the
highway

04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
so we're going to take about five or ten
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
minutes till I get a response from the
 
04:34:28.250 --> 04:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
clerk's office on this
 
04:34:28.260 --> 04:34:33.010 align:start position:0%
clerk's office on this
hmm

04:34:33.010 --> 04:34:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.020 --> 04:34:39.609 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:34:39.609 --> 04:34:39.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
we took out that comma so we're ready to
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
go to that next but we gotta get this
 
04:34:43.561 --> 04:34:52.449 align:start position:0%
go to that next but we gotta get this
results

04:34:52.449 --> 04:34:52.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.520 --> 04:35:49.570 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:35:49.570 --> 04:35:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.820 --> 04:36:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:35.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.131 --> 04:36:43.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.141 --> 04:37:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
police

04:37:11.710 --> 04:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:11.720 --> 04:37:49.029 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:37:49.029 --> 04:37:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
but this is not changed
 
04:39:01.090 --> 04:39:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.410 --> 04:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think this will impact it
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
because this is an introductory
 
04:39:07.970 --> 04:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
paragraph for that program
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
so this is where underneath that program
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
within the education trust when I spoke
 
04:39:17.929 --> 04:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
as Paul said where is the reference to
 
04:39:20.330 --> 04:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
where the monies come out to for the out
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
of that fund for efas I don't think it
 
04:39:27.970 --> 04:39:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.769 --> 04:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
and the other answer is it's the one
 
04:39:33.849 --> 04:39:33.859 align:start position:0%
that's not that it's one that's
 
04:39:33.859 --> 04:39:35.390 align:start position:0%
that's not that it's one that's
enacted

04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
04:39:35.400 --> 04:39:37.010 align:start position:0%
enacted
first

04:39:37.010 --> 04:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the whole process so which
 
04:39:42.650 --> 04:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
one sign and the law works is one of the
 
04:39:42.660 --> 04:39:44.030 align:start position:0%
one sign and the law works is one of the
supersedes

04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
supersedes
 
04:39:49.448 --> 04:39:49.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.610 --> 04:40:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
okay the uh
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
the way I understand this right now is
 
04:40:12.070 --> 04:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
the one that's signed into
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
law last is the one that supersedes
 
04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
however then the other side of the coin
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
is you have to look at what part of the
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is this this is an
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph for School meals
 
04:40:31.090 --> 04:40:31.100 align:start position:0%
not where you would have efas show up
 
04:40:34.970 --> 04:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
within that trust so
 
04:40:38.208 --> 04:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
and I spoke with the clerk about that in
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
the office eyeball the eyeball
 
04:40:43.850 --> 04:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's the my opinion right
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
now that this language right here would
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
negate other language which we've
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
already done
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.570 --> 04:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
so my question and brought this it
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
didn't it because it doesn't just say
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
School meals and add this to it it lists
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
out things that don't have anything to
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
do with school meals like
 
04:41:10.320 --> 04:41:11.868 align:start position:0%
do with school meals like
um

04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
low in moderate income property tax
 
04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
relief School building Aid all of those
 
04:41:22.510 --> 04:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's current law
 
04:41:25.560 --> 04:41:28.850 align:start position:0%
that's current law

04:41:28.860 --> 04:41:41.208 align:start position:0%
 
law

04:41:41.208 --> 04:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.218 --> 04:41:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
right but didn't we just that's that was
 
04:41:51.530 --> 04:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
my point it's it is the section that
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
efas that we just put under isn't it
 
04:41:56.090 --> 04:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's yes
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the the um the section that
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
establishes the education trust fund
 
04:42:03.530 --> 04:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
which begins with this
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
right and so this is adding
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
Define distribution of School meals and
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's another bill that adds to fund
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accountants
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
if both bills pass both those right so
 
04:42:18.650 --> 04:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
it would be mine in underneath the trust
 
04:42:21.650 --> 04:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
I sure hope so well that's how it works
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
because he just said the last one to get
 
04:42:30.650 --> 04:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
and this would be the last one that
 
04:42:34.208 --> 04:42:34.218 align:start position:0%
would be that would be if if
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
this Bill said said
 
04:42:42.170 --> 04:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
um well if you had if you had two
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh Bill's addressing some of the same
 
04:42:48.770 --> 04:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
thing like an EFA to bring it to 500 and
 
04:42:52.010 --> 04:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
EFA to bring it to 350. right
 
04:42:54.890 --> 04:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
right okay then would they look at the
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
last last correct yes that's correct
 
04:42:57.420 --> 04:42:58.610 align:start position:0%
last last correct yes that's correct
okay

04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:01.128 --> 04:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
so thank you basically I don't think you
 
04:43:02.690 --> 04:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
know that that should be a concern in
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%

04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay 573 is a bill dealing with limiting
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
the EFA funding
 
04:47:38.208 --> 04:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
04:47:43.930 --> 04:47:43.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair on
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
573 I would move itl
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay represent Belcher do you have any
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
discussion yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:47:59.218 --> 04:48:00.288 align:start position:0%
discussion yes thank you Mr chair
um

04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
so the way that I the way that I view
 
04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think the the most
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
significant problem that I see with it
 
04:48:08.448 --> 04:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
as it stands our efas are a part of our
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
funding for inadequate education for
 
04:48:17.218 --> 04:48:18.708 align:start position:0%
funding for inadequate education for
students

04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
um now I personally have a very nuanced
 
04:48:23.330 --> 04:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
view of the courts I think I might argue
 
04:48:25.490 --> 04:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
that the legislative branch is
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
prescribed a certain amount of Supremacy
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
but this committee does put a lot of
 
04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
difference on Court decisions and the
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
court has instructed us that we will
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education and
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
because efas are part of that formula to
 
04:48:42.410 --> 04:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
outright restrict the budgeting of that
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
I believe would actually violate that
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that was something we want
 
04:48:50.448 --> 04:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
to be playing with I think we need to
 
04:48:52.250 --> 04:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
allow this popular program to be
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
accessed by the students who want to use
 
04:48:57.288 --> 04:48:57.298 align:start position:0%
it the parents who want to use it
 
04:48:57.298 --> 04:48:58.610 align:start position:0%
it the parents who want to use it
and

04:48:58.610 --> 04:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:00.250 --> 04:49:00.260 align:start position:0%
that's what I'll say about it thank you
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
04:49:04.860 --> 04:49:06.230 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
chair

04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:49:08.330 --> 04:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is contradictory to previous
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
discussions we have regarding the EFA
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
program I think actually I know the
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
program is successful but not speaking
 
04:49:17.570 --> 04:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
to the merits of the program but to the
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill itself to those who see flaws in
 
04:49:22.850 --> 04:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
the EFA program and in the freedom
 
04:49:22.860 --> 04:49:24.530 align:start position:0%
the EFA program and in the freedom
accounts

04:49:24.530 --> 04:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
why would you limit a program's funding
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
a program can't be successful if you cut
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
its funding so if someone sees flaws
 
04:49:33.410 --> 04:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
with the program this would just create
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
more flaws so it just really is
 
04:49:37.250 --> 04:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
contradictory to the whole narrative
 
04:49:39.770 --> 04:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
being spewed in this committee with all
 
04:49:41.930 --> 04:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
due respect
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Luna
 
04:49:47.208 --> 04:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
um a couple points this um the bill
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
before you does not actually cut funding
 
04:49:55.550 --> 04:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh to a program in fact it establishes
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
funding for the program as opposed to
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
the blank check that it is right now uh
 
04:50:02.208 --> 04:50:02.218 align:start position:0%
we heard from um from one member of the
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
public Ms Dunham who um who said what we
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
really need to be doing is advocating
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
for adequate funding for our public
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
schools and not not issuing a platinum
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
card with no credit limit
 
04:50:15.288 --> 04:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
um that's um because that's that's how
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts are
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
currently are currently run what um what
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
573 would do is actually impose some
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility some fiscal
 
04:50:28.850 --> 04:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility into the school voucher
 
04:50:31.850 --> 04:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
program by actually having the um the
 
04:50:31.860 --> 04:50:32.650 align:start position:0%
program by actually having the um the
department

04:50:32.650 --> 04:50:32.660 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for how much money should be
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
should be distributed every year to
 
04:50:41.448 --> 04:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
students through the education Freedom
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
accounts and not have it be the blank
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
check as the legislative budget office
 
04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
assistant has
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
has called it in the past so um so I
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
believe this tightens it up I also
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
passed around
 
04:50:56.480 --> 04:50:58.510 align:start position:0%
passed around
Amendment

04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
0774h which cleans up an error in
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
drafting down online some uh line 12 by
 
04:51:11.810 --> 04:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
it for a summary it just it it it left
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
in the words between not and shall
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
towards the end of line 12 it would take
 
04:51:21.890 --> 04:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
that out and um
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the amendment would also
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
specify that the general fund is a
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
source for um uh for the efas so that's
 
04:51:38.330 --> 04:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment 774 and
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
um and that's really all I've got to say
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
on both those
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative lekkas
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then representative Breville
 
04:51:48.050 --> 04:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
get a bunch of school-aged kids moved
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
into the state
 
04:51:52.010 --> 04:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
would we then tell them I'm sorry we
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.090 --> 04:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative verville
 
04:52:07.550 --> 04:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so it's it's
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
an interesting argument that I just
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
heard because my understanding of the
 
04:52:14.930 --> 04:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
EFA program is that the the grant is
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
well defined in law per pupil so it
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
limits the per pupil spending of the
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
participants so to cap
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's available is
 
04:52:32.208 --> 04:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
essentially a back door at capping at
 
04:52:32.218 --> 04:52:33.490 align:start position:0%
essentially a back door at capping at
limiting

04:52:33.490 --> 04:52:33.500 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
04:52:33.500 --> 04:52:35.170 align:start position:0%
limiting
participation

04:52:35.170 --> 04:52:35.180 align:start position:0%
participation
 
04:52:39.288 --> 04:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
into the the program so
 
04:52:43.010 --> 04:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
if we do that on a wildly popular and
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's my editorializing
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
but at least a clearly popular program
 
04:52:50.810 --> 04:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
what we're going to set up is uh you
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
know some get and some don't so it's
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
going to be how quickly you apply who
 
04:52:58.250 --> 04:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
gets the funding first so now we're
 
04:53:00.530 --> 04:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
pitting student against student family
 
04:53:04.330 --> 04:53:04.340 align:start position:0%
against family by by capping a program
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
that the only the only car block that's
 
04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
available is if all students move to the
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
EFA program
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
and while the participation in the
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
program has outstripped expectations
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'll grant you that
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
um it it certainly is is not a system
 
04:53:25.730 --> 04:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
that's spinning out of control we don't
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
see 10 20 30 50 of students leaving
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
public schools for EFA programs so I
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
would I would say at this time that that
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
this type of move would be ill-advised
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
we should continue on as we are for a
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
couple of years my guess is that we're
 
04:53:45.230 --> 04:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
probably close to the plateau of what
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
that program participation is is likely
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
to be and so I would say
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
um we should support the itl motion so
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
that we can see where the the natural
 
04:53:58.128 --> 04:53:58.138 align:start position:0%
ceiling of participate participation in
 
04:53:59.810 --> 04:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire EFA program is thank
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman you're welcome
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:54:06.530 --> 04:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you um I was actually on the
 
04:54:08.208 --> 04:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
committee I think there's a few other
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
people here back when uh the EF the
 
04:54:14.090 --> 04:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
education tax credits started and then
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the EFA started and I remember that
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
there was a very distinguished
 
04:54:21.410 --> 04:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative from Hillsborough
 
04:54:25.128 --> 04:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
who spoke quite eloquently about the
 
04:54:29.448 --> 04:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
expense of this program and and how uh
 
04:54:31.730 --> 04:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
it could easily spin out of control and
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
how one of the things that he really
 
04:54:37.610 --> 04:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
pushed was a cap on this program
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen several a lot of bills come
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
through with the EFA program with the
 
04:54:48.170 --> 04:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
educational tax program and
 
04:54:48.180 --> 04:54:48.708 align:start position:0%
educational tax program and
um

04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
for some reason we don't get a fiscal
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
note with that it's often missing uh I
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
think almost in all cases it's missing
 
04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's considered undeterminable or the
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education hasn't gotten
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriate information to make
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
a physical node and that's particularly
 
04:55:12.288 --> 04:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
since we had the first fiscal note for
 
04:55:16.368 --> 04:55:16.378 align:start position:0%
the EFA programs which severely severely
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
underestimated what the program was
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
as far as caps are concerned for example
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
special education cat Aid is based on
 
04:55:28.368 --> 04:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
the total number of money of monies the
 
04:55:30.050 --> 04:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
total amount of monies within that
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
program and if there's more it's then
 
04:55:35.930 --> 04:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
divvied out so that the total amount
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
that often schools receive is down
 
04:55:39.890 --> 04:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
around 50 percent of what they actually
 
04:55:39.900 --> 04:55:41.288 align:start position:0%
around 50 percent of what they actually
spent

04:55:41.288 --> 04:55:41.298 align:start position:0%
spent
 
04:55:44.690 --> 04:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
so we have caps in in the education fund
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
we have caps on different
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
um other vouchers that we give snap
 
04:55:50.760 --> 04:55:52.070 align:start position:0%
um other vouchers that we give snap
programs

04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
um you know and it and it's unfortunate
 
04:55:55.490 --> 04:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
that we can't
 
04:55:58.368 --> 04:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
uh just open the doors and say you know
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
let's take the billion dollars that
 
04:56:03.288 --> 04:56:03.298 align:start position:0%
Surplus in the budget and uh put it all
 
04:56:05.208 --> 04:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
in education but that doesn't seem to be
 
04:56:05.218 --> 04:56:06.230 align:start position:0%
in education but that doesn't seem to be
happening

04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
so since that isn't happening and since
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
we have to be physically conservative
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
which I agree to
 
04:56:15.410 --> 04:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I think a cap is necessary thank you
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:56:19.610 --> 04:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair I would just
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
I would just add because there is there
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
is some concern about the the money side
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
of this and and that's fair but the
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
limit to spending on this is not
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
infinite even the theoretical limit is
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
limited to the number of students we
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire and even that
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
theoretical limit will not be hit
 
04:56:33.840 --> 04:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
theoretical limit will not be hit
however

04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:56:38.030 --> 04:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
if it were hit we do know that right now
 
04:56:40.730 --> 04:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
the money that we're spending or the
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
money that we're giving to uh EFA
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
students in this grant
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
compared to the average cost to educate
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
a student in public or Charter Schools
 
04:56:52.270 --> 04:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
it would result in about an 80 reduction
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
in costs to educate now that's not going
 
04:56:56.448 --> 04:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
to happen nobody here thinks that's
 
04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen not all students are
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to go for efas who knows how many
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
more will I doubt it's going to be a
 
04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
huge percentage more than we already
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
have but we're talking cost savings here
 
04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
not cost increases
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
up represent balbourney
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
um actually you you are talking about
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
kind of sitting here's um increases for
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
districts because there's a whole bunch
 
04:57:21.830 --> 04:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
of students in districts right now that
 
04:57:24.530 --> 04:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
are currently in private schools that
 
04:57:27.410 --> 04:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
are not a burden on the local districts
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.690 --> 04:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
if I may yes you absolutely have a point
 
04:57:38.208 --> 04:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
that students who are already perhaps in
 
04:57:40.010 --> 04:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
private schools who now access these
 
04:57:43.490 --> 04:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
funds would be an additional
 
04:57:46.128 --> 04:57:46.138 align:start position:0%
burden on taxpayers however from an
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
ethical side you have to make the
 
04:57:49.490 --> 04:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
argument that somebody who pays taxes
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
and as a resident in the state should
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
not have access to funds per the Supreme
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
Court decision for an adequate education
 
04:57:58.128 --> 04:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
second the amount of students that are
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
coming from or in private schools in
 
04:58:02.208 --> 04:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
this state compared to those who are
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
accessing through this program it's not
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
even a trade-off when it comes to that
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
80 percent number that is the cost of an
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
EFA program versus the average cost of
 
04:58:13.570 --> 04:58:13.580 align:start position:0%
the public school education student
 
04:58:15.890 --> 04:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
well on that point I think unless I'm
 
04:58:18.718 --> 04:58:20.330 align:start position:0%
well on that point I think unless I'm
incorrect

04:58:20.330 --> 04:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
it's been reported at this committee
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
that there has been 3 200 students who
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
are in the EFA program and a hundred
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
were from public schools that means 3
 
04:58:34.368 --> 04:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
100 were already in private schools and
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
were not a burden or were not part of
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
the local cost for education
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to quickly
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct that statistic that was the
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
previous year attending a public school
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
there were students within that figure
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
who had attended a public school
 
04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
previously just maybe not during the
 
04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
previous Academic Year or maybe the year
 
04:58:58.490 --> 04:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
prior the year prior to that but they
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
were in public schools to an extent as
 
04:59:00.600 --> 04:59:01.368 align:start position:0%
were in public schools to an extent as
well

04:59:01.368 --> 04:59:01.378 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative reveal
 
04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's another one
 
04:59:08.810 --> 04:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
of these sort of interesting which way
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
are we choosing to to look at the Statue
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
type of questions because what I hear
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
from the other side of the aisle is that
 
04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:59:20.930 --> 04:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
should pick up a much larger burden of
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding public education in the state of
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:59:27.470 --> 04:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
and we can agree or disagree on on that
 
04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
fact but I think we all have to agree
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the EFA program is actually a 100
 
04:59:33.240 --> 04:59:34.490 align:start position:0%
that the EFA program is actually a 100
percent

04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
state level funded program
 
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary program it's a program
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
that people choose to participate in
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
and then the the funding is a hundred
 
04:59:48.050 --> 04:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
percent state so it's it's a it's a
 
04:59:50.110 --> 04:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
property tax relief
 
04:59:53.330 --> 04:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
at the local level for for local public
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
schools I mean it's
 
04:59:58.010 --> 04:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
I I have to admit I'm confused because I
 
05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
would think that there are members on
 
05:00:01.670 --> 05:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
this committee that would think that
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
this would be a dream come true that
 
05:00:05.570 --> 05:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
this is providing an adequate education
 
05:00:07.310 --> 05:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
according to the the parents and the
 
05:00:09.288 --> 05:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
families of the participants and it's a
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
05:00:13.550 --> 05:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
state funded and and not a burden on the
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer I would I would think
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
that this would be a win-win-win thank
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add that we've gone through
 
05:00:23.208 --> 05:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
capping of adequacy in the past I can
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
recall back what was it 14 15 something
 
05:00:28.490 --> 05:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
like that where we capped the amount of
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
money some of the schools in the
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state could receive
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have any more growth than
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
106 or 108 percent so we capped what
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
they would get they should have gotten
 
05:00:38.690 --> 05:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
more for adequacy what happened there
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
was a suit that came back against the
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
state saying that's unconstitutional and
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
we had to end up paying those school
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
districts the money which they were
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
deserving to have initially so capping
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
any program like this that has to do
 
05:00:54.170 --> 05:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
with uh funds for the opportunity for an
 
05:00:58.810 --> 05:00:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so we're going to have to agree
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
to disagree on on that particular Point
 
05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
um there's been no lawsuit ever filed in
 
05:01:09.410 --> 05:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire alleging that
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
the state is failing to provide an
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all its students
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
because it's not paying for private
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
school tuition bills and um and neither
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
decision in the conval cases or the
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
Londonderry case issue that the state
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
meets its constitutional obligations uh
 
05:01:28.128 --> 05:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
for educating all of its children by
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
providing an opportunity for an adequate
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
education through public schools in
 
05:01:33.060 --> 05:01:34.150 align:start position:0%
education through public schools in
every

05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
school-age child in the state of New
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has access to that opportunity
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
through Public Schools if they choose to
 
05:01:45.170 --> 05:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
go do something else that's a choice
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
they make on their own and the state's
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
not denying them access to an adequate
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
education because the state is making
 
05:01:53.930 --> 05:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
that available to them through their
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
Public Schools there's not a
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
for um for for for for
 
05:02:03.530 --> 05:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
um uh uh capping or or limiting to
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
budgeted amounts the education of
 
05:02:07.490 --> 05:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
freedom freedom account program in fact
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's not even a constitutional
 
05:02:13.368 --> 05:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
argument to completely uh um repeal the
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program uh but
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
there is a constitutional argument when
 
05:02:22.610 --> 05:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
the state decides not to fund at 100
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
percent the cost of an adequate
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
education as defined by Statute for
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
school districts like Dover and Bedford
 
05:02:32.930 --> 05:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
who are only getting getting paid 95
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
percent of um of their cost of
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
inadequate education so the state was
 
05:02:40.970 --> 05:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
right to lose that case and those
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
districts were right that the state was
 
05:02:44.330 --> 05:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
not living up to its constitutional
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
obligation but the state has no
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation insofar as the
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
school Voucher Program
 
05:02:56.448 --> 05:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.948 --> 05:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
I would just repeat what one efa's
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
parents said
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
after listening to all these arguments
 
05:03:07.730 --> 05:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
what are my kids garbage
 
05:03:12.288 --> 05:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
because her kids can't get an adequate
 
05:03:14.570 --> 05:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
education at the public school because
 
05:03:17.050 --> 05:03:17.060 align:start position:0%
they have special needs that
 
05:03:19.550 --> 05:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
and various other things that won't be
 
05:03:19.560 --> 05:03:20.628 align:start position:0%
and various other things that won't be
met

05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
met
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
how many how many parents do we have
 
05:03:24.650 --> 05:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
come in here and say their kids weren't
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
getting inadequate even an opportunity
 
05:03:29.570 --> 05:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education because they
 
05:03:33.288 --> 05:03:33.298 align:start position:0%
were being bullied incessantly because
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
their EFA their um
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
special needs weren't being met and so
 
05:03:40.850 --> 05:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
now we're telling them uh

05:20:14.690 --> 05:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna head right back up
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
north there to 5 30.
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a co-op
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
we had a motion I believe was it art
 
05:20:24.718 --> 05:20:25.850 align:start position:0%
we had a motion I believe was it art
OTP

05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
on the floor and I believe there's an
 
05:20:31.550 --> 05:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that's come forth represent
 
05:20:33.650 --> 05:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
Belcher do you have that Amendment yes
 
05:20:35.570 --> 05:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to introduce
 
05:20:35.580 --> 05:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to introduce
Amendment

05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
zero nine five five H to HP 530.
 
05:20:44.690 --> 05:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
um what I've done what we discussed
 
05:20:49.128 --> 05:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
about uh this bill was to clarify that
 
05:20:51.650 --> 05:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
um that comma that was located in the
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
wrong spot down on lines nine through
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
ten to make that part clear and we've
 
05:21:00.170 --> 05:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
also struck the provision that would
 
05:21:02.650 --> 05:21:02.660 align:start position:0%
allow a super majority
 
05:21:07.128 --> 05:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
of the no vote from keeping a town from
 
05:21:08.690 --> 05:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
being able to leave
 
05:21:10.490 --> 05:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
the district with the hopes that that
 
05:21:12.410 --> 05:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
would be able to um
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
restart a negotiation for
 
05:21:18.170 --> 05:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh towns that have been significantly
 
05:21:20.690 --> 05:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
impacted by changes in their real estate
 
05:21:24.350 --> 05:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
value or demographics and such over time
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
05:21:32.270 --> 05:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chair and so
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
the way I'm reading this is that it
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear that
 
05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
either a um
 
05:21:41.100 --> 05:21:41.890 align:start position:0%
either a um
a

05:21:41.890 --> 05:21:41.900 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:21:45.770 --> 05:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
vote of the co-op
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
a majority vote of the co-op uh uh in
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
favor of withdrawal plus a majority vote
 
05:21:55.730 --> 05:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
of the withdrawing District in favor of
 
05:22:00.350 --> 05:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal is sufficient to to do a
 
05:22:04.010 --> 05:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or that a three-fifths vote
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
of the district who wants to withdraw
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that by itself would also be
 
05:22:12.170 --> 05:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uh for the district to
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
withdraw yes that's correct thank you
 
05:22:20.690 --> 05:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion for a the amendment
 
05:22:28.490 --> 05:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
zero nine five five h
 
05:22:32.930 --> 05:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
did we have most to for that
 
05:22:32.940 --> 05:22:34.910 align:start position:0%
did we have most to for that
Amendment

05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
I would move ought to pass on Amendment
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
zero nine five five H okay we got now in
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
a second do we have a second second
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
okay now is there any further discussion
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative Luna yeah thank you
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so so wouldn't this um you know
 
05:23:00.170 --> 05:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
if this were to become law this would
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
basically say any uh any District that
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
wants out of a co-op any pre-existing
 
05:23:07.208 --> 05:23:07.218 align:start position:0%
District that wants out of a co-op
 
05:23:11.208 --> 05:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
three-fifths sixty percent vote of just
 
05:23:13.390 --> 05:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
that just the voters in that
 
05:23:15.890 --> 05:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District not the voters in
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
the overall Co-op just the voters in
 
05:23:19.970 --> 05:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
that pre-existing District would be
 
05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
sufficient to um for um for a district
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
to pull out of a co-op so um so
 
05:23:27.000 --> 05:23:28.250 align:start position:0%
to pull out of a co-op so um so
virtually

05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
well actually it would apply to any
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
District anybody that wants out
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
I want to get out and um and doesn't
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
matter how much
 
05:23:40.850 --> 05:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
bonded debt or Debt Service or other
 
05:23:43.850 --> 05:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
encumbrances or anything else that might
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
be be going on and this thing I suppose
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
they'd have to work that out but um but
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
but essentially
 
05:23:51.958 --> 05:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
but essentially
um

05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
any um
 
05:23:58.368 --> 05:23:58.378 align:start position:0%
any pre-existing District
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
or municipality I guess that's a member
 
05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
of a of a co-op if they want out they
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
get out they don't they don't have to
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
work out anything with the um
 
05:24:13.550 --> 05:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the co-op District
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's just really
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous I think that that defeats the
 
05:24:19.970 --> 05:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of having Co-op agreements
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
I understand there's problems with Co-op
 
05:24:23.628 --> 05:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
agreements but my god let's fix the
 
05:24:25.850 --> 05:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
co-op agreements then
 
05:24:29.090 --> 05:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and and you know let's provide maybe
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
some balance to uh to it you know we
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today from from attorney
 
05:24:39.890 --> 05:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
Christina that that over the last what
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
couple of decades there's been a handful
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
of districts that have um have pulled
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
out a co-op so so for some of these
 
05:24:49.070 --> 05:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
districts the um
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
the current laws is is enabling that but
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
this just seems like a really radical
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
way of um of renegging on a uh on an on
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
an existing contract and and you know I
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
I know we we hear a lot well this is the
 
05:25:09.170 --> 05:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
way we do things and stuff like that but
 
05:25:10.610 --> 05:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
um but you know these are private
 
05:25:13.550 --> 05:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and and now we're now we're
 
05:25:16.368 --> 05:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
giving one party in a contract the
 
05:25:19.550 --> 05:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
ability to renege on that contract and
 
05:25:19.560 --> 05:25:20.570 align:start position:0%
ability to renege on that contract and
um

05:25:20.570 --> 05:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe in the maybe in the
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
case of Carol it's not going to be
 
05:25:28.250 --> 05:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
devastating to the to the rest of the
 
05:25:29.930 --> 05:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
co-op I guess I really don't know that
 
05:25:33.650 --> 05:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
but um but quite possibly for a lot of
 
05:25:37.368 --> 05:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
other Cooperative districts uh uh you
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
know especially if if maybe one of the
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
one of the bigger municipalities in The
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
District in the co-op I mean decides to
 
05:25:48.050 --> 05:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
withdraw that could be devastating and
 
05:25:50.208 --> 05:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
um and it could cause local property tax
 
05:25:52.368 --> 05:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
rates to that haven't already gone
 
05:25:55.550 --> 05:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
through the roof to go through the roof
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
um plus they're doing this without any
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
input from from the co-op so
 
05:26:03.410 --> 05:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is this is very
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory
 
05:26:05.700 --> 05:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory
foreign

05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:19.128 --> 05:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
it's not entirely without regard to
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the property Etc does say a withdrawal
 
05:26:23.810 --> 05:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
plan shall be prepared and shall provide
 
05:26:25.490 --> 05:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
for the disposition of property held
 
05:26:27.050 --> 05:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
within the cooperative
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
and a statement of assumption of
 
05:26:28.920 --> 05:26:30.670 align:start position:0%
and a statement of assumption of
liabilities

05:26:30.670 --> 05:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
05:26:30.680 --> 05:26:32.230 align:start position:0%
liabilities
but

05:26:32.230 --> 05:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:26:36.708 --> 05:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
if you know that a small District can
 
05:26:39.000 --> 05:26:40.250 align:start position:0%
if you know that a small District can
leave

05:26:40.250 --> 05:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would think you would be quick to come
 
05:26:45.650 --> 05:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
back to the table and see what their
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
complaints are
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
and see if you guys can come to an
 
05:26:51.410 --> 05:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
agreement so they don't want to leave
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
for instance with Carol I suspect if it
 
05:26:58.550 --> 05:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
was 50 50 instead of 40 60 they may well
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
I am quite hesitant in voting for this
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment as it is when we've taken that
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
last part of the sentence in part two
 
05:27:08.280 --> 05:27:09.890 align:start position:0%
last part of the sentence in part two
out

05:27:09.890 --> 05:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:27:12.890 --> 05:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
I really am I mean I I believe that
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli who's the maker of
 
05:27:17.330 --> 05:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
this bill would also be very very
 
05:27:17.340 --> 05:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
this bill would also be very very
hesitant

05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do at this time
 
05:27:22.970 --> 05:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
because I I don't see this is hitting
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
the mark
 
05:27:25.970 --> 05:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess this meeting until
 
05:27:28.550 --> 05:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow until Wednesday and when
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is back here and
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
we'll pick it up exactly where we are
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
right now and I want everybody to
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
consider uh that I believe there needs
 
05:27:40.010 --> 05:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
to be a vote
 
05:27:43.070 --> 05:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the whole District it can go two ways
 
05:27:43.080 --> 05:27:44.030 align:start position:0%
of the whole District it can go two ways
here

05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
and um that's what I I believe that
 
05:27:48.650 --> 05:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and I had
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussed with numerous people Beyond
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
this committee to try to ascertain and I
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
think this by doing this we are going
 
05:28:00.530 --> 05:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
back to uh more conflict if we went with
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
this so at this point in time we're done
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
with this for today
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we will come back and pick this bill
 
05:28:11.448 --> 05:28:11.458 align:start position:0%
up uh on Wednesday and so this this
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill is in recess until
 
05:28:15.170 --> 05:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
Monday we'll announce that and we'll
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
continue the exact session for 5 30 at
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
that time on Wednesday at five uh we'll
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
come back and deal with 5 30 on
 
05:28:22.200 --> 05:28:23.570 align:start position:0%
come back and deal with 5 30 on
Wednesday

05:28:23.570 --> 05:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
05:28:23.580 --> 05:28:25.128 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
yes

05:28:25.128 --> 05:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:28:28.550 --> 05:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the query around the start time for
 
05:28:28.560 --> 05:28:31.128 align:start position:0%
the query around the start time for
Wednesday

05:28:31.128 --> 05:28:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
um should it be continue to be 9 30. I'm
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
just concerned does anybody have a more
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
recent weather report as far as when the
 
05:28:41.810 --> 05:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
storm is supposed to be concluded and
 
05:28:44.288 --> 05:28:44.298 align:start position:0%
are we going to be able to have uh
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
Road access uh I'm particularly
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about those who are coming
 
05:28:51.770 --> 05:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
from a long distance here and whether or
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
not starting like even like at 10
 
05:28:57.170 --> 05:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
instead of 9 30 might help those
 
05:28:59.448 --> 05:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
traveling from long distances well you
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
know represent Milo I'd be more
 
05:29:02.930 --> 05:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
concerned about not those coming from
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
Conway or from Haverhill or from Berlin
 
05:29:08.090 --> 05:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
which are used to driving in this stuff
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
be concerned about those coming in from
 
05:29:18.970 --> 05:29:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:22.010 --> 05:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay but looking at our what we have
 
05:29:26.750 --> 05:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.930 --> 05:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
we have including the bill today sends
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven eight
 
05:29:35.690 --> 05:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
bills which is very doable
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
um the bills though
 
05:29:41.208 --> 05:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
um carry a a lot and then and they're
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
important in fact the first one 452 uh
 
05:29:47.628 --> 05:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with school building Aid
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
I understand There's issues occurring
 
05:29:52.010 --> 05:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
with school building Aid right now in
 
05:29:55.128 --> 05:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
finance that we should be aware of
 
05:29:55.138 --> 05:29:56.510 align:start position:0%
finance that we should be aware of
and

05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:00.410 --> 05:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so 452 is important
 
05:30:00.420 --> 05:30:01.730 align:start position:0%
um so 452 is important
um

05:30:01.730 --> 05:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:05.090 --> 05:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
and all as they all are so please uh
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
look these over so we can scoop through
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
them if we run out of time if it's
 
05:30:10.010 --> 05:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
really short we'll put the limit on who
 
05:30:11.810 --> 05:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
