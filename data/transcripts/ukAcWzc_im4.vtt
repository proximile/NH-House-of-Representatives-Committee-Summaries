00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's amendment number 1365 H I
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
have more copies here if anybody doesn't
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay it's yeah take a couple
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
yes and I'd like to explain this yes
 
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.029 align:start position:0%
yes and I'd like to explain this yes
please

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.050 align:start position:0%
please
um

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment deletes the restructuring
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's partly because we weren't
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
convinced by the testimony that the
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
board needed to be restructured and
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
partly because the house position is as
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
expressed in House Bill 2 is that the
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
board is deleted
 
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
so as that's our position we aren't
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to mess with the composition of
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
however the
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
testimony did indicate that the website
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
for the board has a lot of useful data
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly from the early days when it
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
was more active and so this amendment
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
simply tells the oplc
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
to maintain that website for five years
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's long enough for some other or
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
some other board if necessary to take
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
over the structure
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
and it will preserve the data that we
 
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
have and
 
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
have and
um

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
since that doesn't cost much
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
to just to maintain the website the oplc
 
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:00.500 align:start position:0%
has agreed to doing that with no trouble
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
and I think that five years is long
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:10.099 align:start position:0%
for for a successor
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
organization if one is needed to be
 
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
organization if one is needed to be
created

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
nope

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
um I would invite
 
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:29.900 align:start position:0%
I see a representative hunt here who
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
actually our committee felt that this
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
feel more likely would have gone to his
 
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.329 align:start position:0%
feel more likely would have gone to his
committee

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
so I have invited him this morning to
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else who would care
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to have
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
five members so we have a quorum
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
so do I have a motion to
 
00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:09.019 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
I did oh sorry I didn't hear you
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
those in favor of the amendment
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
just verbal
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
hi okay so the amendment is being put
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
forward three to nothing
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
and that will be the recommendation to
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
um again pointing out that
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
um the board has technically been
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
deleted by virtue of the house passing
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
hv2 that therefore becomes the house
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
physician and it will now be a matter of
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sure discussion in any Committee of
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
conference between the House and Senate
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
going if the Senate chooses not to
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
delete it yeah they that's that's the
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
next step but in any event that as
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
amended this bill will keep the data
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
available no matter what the Senate does
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
and no matter what type of success or
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
organization is decided on yep
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I move out to pass with
 
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
okay so I move out to pass with

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so is
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
do we see any part of the proposed
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
amendment that we want to use or just go
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill to
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think this whole section
 
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
I think this whole section
is

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
way too deep in the details
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
and I understand there's another bill in
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
HHS considering this whole issue
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I would like to eliminate this whole
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
change to
 
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.530 align:start position:0%
change to
um

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
The rulemaking Authority regarding
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and the only thing that as I
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
understand it we need to include
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
is on the bill itself on paper
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
well I I think
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
um what we heard was the addition of one
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
dentist member
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
who administers general anesthesia that
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sedation should be added
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
to the board right the other thing that
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
that would be important was on page two
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
line nine pair subparagraph e
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
yes permits to Denver for the facilities
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
yes and that's in the version amended by
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
right and I I think that's that's
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
something that the oplc told us was
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
important because otherwise you end up
 
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
important because otherwise you end up
with

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh multiple
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
multiple inspections
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
it whenever a person changes so if you
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
get a facility permit
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
you just have to check that the people
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
are there and not
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
um not deal with the inspections and
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I think the bill does need further
 
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
um I think the bill does need further
amending

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
amending
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
um per
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um Miss Courtney from VLC
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if I caught everything
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um she talked about on page three line
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
ten the fee setting because and I
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
understand that that's
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
um agreeable
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
to the Dental Board is that correct to
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
let opiel see uh set the fees that's
 
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:21.510 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:29.029 align:start position:0%
already in place
[Laughter]

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:30.260 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay and um well I think that the
 
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.289 align:start position:0%
okay and um well I think that the
uh

00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes we definitely want to change that
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
language and we'll need to get
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
the appropriate uh citation
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
and and I will just state to the folks
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
who approached me
 
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:53.660 align:start position:0%
to put forward the amendment
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
my understanding is correct that
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
amendment was proposed to the Senate
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee for
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
Senate field 91 is that pretty much
 
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.350 align:start position:0%
Senate field 91 is that pretty much
correct

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:09.140 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
could you come to the microphone sorry
 
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative representative Schmidt he
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
he testified at the initial hearing he's
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
a nurse anesthetist who specialize is an
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
we had a little difficulty with our
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
scheduling because we're this is the
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
only subcommittee that's actually
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
working on specific Center bills the
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
so um I'll just State further that
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we kind of feel like the the question
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
of sedation should more properly be
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
handled by a committee that deals with
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services our committee
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
was to look at the rules particularly so
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
I think until that issue is resolved by
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
addressing it for rules could be
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
a little problematic if we agree to
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
something premature I demand that so yes
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to speak to that um
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
actually the original SB 147 did not
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
contain any changes to the sedation
 
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.930 align:start position:0%
contain any changes to the sedation
rules

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
um and in fact as I understand at the
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners did not even
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
put forth an amendment lifting the
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
exemption uh until the Senate took it up
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh and that amendment was offered uh so
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes of course
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
you'd think I would have known this by
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
now my name is Michael Auerbach for the
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
record I'm the executive director of the
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dental Society normally I
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
do not speak to rules changes
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
um however uh we've been carefully
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
watching this one because it's had an
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
impact so as I said
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
um the original bill which we were very
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
much in favor of particularly as it
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
answers a lot of the questions by
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
putting in a a sedation provider like an
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon like Dr Abel here on the
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
board in the first place a lot of those
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions could have been answered so uh
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
by if you're proposing to remove uh the
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
changes to section H altogether I don't
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
think we have a problem with that and we
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
would like to see that a rule address
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
we the details of who is where and and
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
what the requirements are
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
ought to be defined by
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
people with more technical background on
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
it we can
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
once they've done that we can address
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking authority but we
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be setting the The rulemaking
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
Authority before they've done the
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
technical work that's backwards
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
may I just said I'm Dr Mark Abel from
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon in Manchester I live in
 
00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.049 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon in Manchester I live in
Bedford

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
um the another important thing that the
 
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:54.260 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
sb147 is it creates an anesthesia uh
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
committee for the board of dental
 
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:02.210 align:start position:0%
committee for the board of dental
examiners

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
um do you see that you see that on page
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's 317 a 2B anesthesia
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
and sedation committee
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that's absolutely critical because
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
right now the board of dental examiners
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an official anesthesia
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
committee so this is the first time that
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
the legislature is officially creating
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
that committee for the board of dental
 
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:37.549 align:start position:0%
that committee for the board of dental
examiners

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
well actually all of this would be the
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
left hand except for
 
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
left hand except for
it's

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
so if I may ask good so Dr Abel you're
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of that of that the inclusion
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the of such a subcommittee on in the
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
Dental Board yeah oh absolutely in fact
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
we had a committee that I was on I was
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
actually chair of the committee for Num
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
for a period of time and that committee
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
had to be disbanded because um when the
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
Dental Board was audited it was
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
determined that that committee could not
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
exist because it was never created by
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature well I'm I'm remembering
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
exactly that that point of uh contention
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
when the bill was heard before us uh
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
several months ago they said
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
you have no legal basis uh to be doing
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
this because a statute does not address
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
this at all so
 
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:46.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
down through so down through G we want
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
to keep yeah I we certainly don't want
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the requirement that
 
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.549 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the requirement that
somebody

00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
who knows about anesthesia is present
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
Madam chairs is there some uh
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
possibility we could ask somebody from
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
the HHS committee to sit in on these
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
deliberations because I totally agree
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we kind of got the heart the cart
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
before the horse here uh or the heart
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
before the course for that matter
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
representatives in any case there is a
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
senate field 91 which has been
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
re-referred by Senate Health and Human
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
Services and the amendment that was
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
presented to our committee has is in
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
their position it was presented to them
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying that to me is the
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
proper place they're looking at it
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're considering it and I think they
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
should be the ones to make the those
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions I I think that a very
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
important information I'm glad you were
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
put that out because I agree but the
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we we are getting
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely ahead of ourselves in this
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee with regard to rules and and
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
we need to have that that issue
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
addressed before we
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
right is there any disagreement on that
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
you you've joined us late but uh uh
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
would you like to be heard on this
 
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:27.529 align:start position:0%
would you like to be heard on this
subject

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:29.769 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:29.779 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to yes thank you we'll be
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
happy to uh yes
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the chair will recognize Ms Courtney
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
who had made a couple recommendations I
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
think we caught a couple of them but
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
we'd like to hear from you if you have
 
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
this happened to me once I went to the
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
wrong room and and Georgetown I became a
 
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
wrong room and and Georgetown I became a
dentist

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
dentist
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's never happened before so uh yeah
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh I represent the board of dental
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
examiners and I'd like to thank the
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee for letting me have the
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the board's
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
position on Bill 147.
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
the National Standard for deep sedation
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and hospitals and surgery
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
centers is to have a separate dedicated
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
provider to administer anesthesia
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons are the only health care
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
providers that provide deep sedation

general anesthesia to Pediatric patients
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
without separate providers
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
there are seven National recognized
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
societies comprised of experts in
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
Pediatric and pediatric anesthesia that
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
recommend against a single operator
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
provider model currently used they are
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire board has been
responsible

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
to the public to make Dentistry as safe
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
as possible the sole reason that I'm on
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
the board is for Public Safety I take
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
time out of my schedule
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
I've been researching this for as long
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
as I've been on the board and so I'm
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
very passionate about it
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
when there are so many experts against
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
the single provider model the board
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
cannot ignore the inherent risk
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
associated associated with this practice
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
we've investigated the impact to access
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
the care as well as a cost analysis and
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
found adding a dedicated provider had
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
minimal effect on the overall picture of
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
surgical theater the boat the the board
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
voted unanity to have a dedicated
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
provider for deep sedation for children
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
under the age of eight
 
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.750 align:start position:0%
under the age of eight
[Music]

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.409 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
which is a little different than when
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the oral surgeon brought forth the
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
exemption for having a dedicated
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
provider who has had so many hours of
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
experience in a period of time
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
this proposal was rejected by the board
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
of dental examiners the issue is not
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
surgeon's competency level or experience
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
it is in fact that they would have not
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
have enough providers if there was an
 
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.610 align:start position:0%
have enough providers if there was an
emergency

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
I draw a comparison to Miracle on the
 
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.570 align:start position:0%
I draw a comparison to Miracle on the
Hudson

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh Captain sullenberg the pilot of
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
Miracle on the Hudson had 50 years
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
flying experience 20 000 hours yet he
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
relied heavily on his second officer
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
during that emergency so this has
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with experience it has to
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
do with handling pediatric deep sedation
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
so I I believe this is exactly the type
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
of argument that we heard did we not at
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
the time that the bill was heard and I
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
apologize for not making that but uh
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the rules that encompers the
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
board is that we have to be voted
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
permission to come and talk and I was
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
given permission to go to the Senate but
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
they failed to put that in the motion so
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
I was not allowed to attend the other
 
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.090 align:start position:0%
I was not allowed to attend the other
meeting

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.100 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much we
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
um this part of what you were saying was
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
presented by Dr tivolt at our hearing
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
however he did State when he was there
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
that he was just representing himself he
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
was not authorized to speak for
 
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.950 align:start position:0%
was not authorized to speak for
um

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
he does
 
00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:08.930 align:start position:0%
he does
um

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
a vast amount of dental pediatric
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
anesthesia he's very experienced in that
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
in that area I understand that but like
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
I said we had to take him at his word he
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
not officially representing them or the
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
section H from the bill I don't have
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
that in front of me hold on let me I
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.049 align:start position:0%
might have
foreign

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:53.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%

the amendment yeah the amendment is
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
Section Eight yeah
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
um basically we want to remove section H
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
from we want to amend the bill to remove
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
section h
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
because that's deep into who does what
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
and not speaking I'm sorry can we just
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
indicate the line that you're
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
referencing so the doctor on the bill as
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate page 2 line 17 sub
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph h
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
which goes on down through the bottom of
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
the page
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
so the amendment as far as the
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
documentation of cases presented
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're not for that no no no no we want
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
to take out
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
we want to take out from the bill
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
section H which means we don't H which
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
means we don't want to insert the
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
yeah you're doctor you're you're looking
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
at the wrong document if you're looking
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
at the amendment they're looking at the
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
original bill so we got to get you a
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
copy of that
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah we're looking at the
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
um the bill amended by the Senate
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is the proposal
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
would be to completely eliminate Section
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
8 of that amended version
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
yes that's subsection H as in horse yep
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
and and so the Practical the way I see
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
that the Practical impact would be that
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
there would be a second provider
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
required to be present because there
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay so as far as removing that
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
exemption I can't
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
the board we we're and uh that's really
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
important career
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
you can use it sir yeah I'm sorry we
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
just passed
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
we just passed a rule change
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
that has gone to oplc to address this
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
problem so and I'm not really the
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
problem the problem with single provider
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
anesthesia in a deep sedation for
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Dentistry I'm sorry I should
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
be more clear
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
and go ahead if I may So currently the
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
way the statute their current statute
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
currently reads is that they are allowed
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
to provide waivers of of having
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
um the requirement that two persons be
 
00:35:34.569 --> 00:35:34.579 align:start position:0%
present historically they have always
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
waived that provision
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
um the board is now contemplating
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
um only waving that under certain
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
circumstances however obviously the
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
statute Trump's rule so if the statue uh
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
were to be adopted I think as I'm
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
reading the amended version of the
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
Senate taking out Section 8 that
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
obviously would Trump whatever rules
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
so again I'll ask is if we just remove
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
section h
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
is that going to allow you I assume
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to be bringing those rules
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
so would that mean that we wouldn't have
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
the board wouldn't have the authority
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
over it anyways as I was saying
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
the situation is currently that they
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
allow waivers right so the support can
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
can since it's a waiver the board can
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
decide not to issue any more waivers I
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
mean that's right right I don't
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
a statute is not necessarily required a
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
statutory change with respect to that
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
issue because the board currently
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
retains that Authority
 
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
retains that Authority
um

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the word currently retains that
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
authority to issue waivers or not issue
 
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.089 align:start position:0%
authority to issue waivers or not issue
waivers

00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:55.940 align:start position:0%
and it was pointed out to us that we
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
previous boards gave a blanket waiver
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
and during the audit it was pointed out
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
good thing to do
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
so hence here we are and I apologize for
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
my confusion of what law versus the
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
regulation uh I'm not familiar with that
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
It Ain't Easy the uh many other people
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
well if they if the board already has
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
the authority to do this
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't want to put it into
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
statute because it's way beyond our
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
skills yeah
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
so and like I said if Senate Health and
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
Human Services feels that that's within
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
their Fairview they can come in back
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
with it next year they've got a bill to
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
do it if I may Madam chair I do think
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
that um another portion of this bill 147
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
what was important to the board was the
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
establishment of the facility license I
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
wasn't the person best able to
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
articulate why the board thought that
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
was the appropriate model so I don't
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
know if you want to hear from Dr
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
Ludington on that issue
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
well they they spoke to us at the
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and that seemed pretty obvious
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
to all of us yeah I think there's no
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
problem with that okay you had mentioned
 
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:17.060 align:start position:0%
a couple places particularly
 
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:19.220 align:start position:0%
item e
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
the permits for dental facilities we
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
intend to leave that in
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
and you had talked about on page
 
00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:30.050 align:start position:0%
and you had talked about on page
three

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
line ten
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
about fee setting yes that that should
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
should that just be should that entire
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
thing be deleted or
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
just who just put a period after fee
 
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.890 align:start position:0%
just who just put a period after fee
yeah

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think I think that would do it but the
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
board should be deleted deleted
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
was there any other section that you are
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
concerned about besides those those two
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I think under that
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
paragraph B's is documentation of
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
competence uh we we certainly don't want
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay and uh so you're you're suggesting
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
deleting Item B no no not deleting item
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay so that's well that's just gonna
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
stay there then right yeah well actually
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want to make the change we want
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
to go through G
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
according to the rules on through G
 
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
which includes
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
qualifications for deep
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
facility license the physical presence
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
of somebody licensed and
 
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.870 align:start position:0%
of somebody licensed and
um

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
which are the only changes
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm so we don't want to
 
00:40:03.609 --> 00:40:03.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
Madam chair there is one other change
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we would propose is that we support
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the anesthesia and
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
sedation committee but I was currently
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
drafted it it limits
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
um membership to dentists and dentists
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
are not the only individuals who provide
 
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
anesthesia in a dental setting
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
so we would suggest language to include
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
those individuals nurse anesthetists and
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
or anesthesiologists who practice in a
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
dental setting
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.140 align:start position:0%
one dentist married
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
and four additional license anesthesia
 
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.430 align:start position:0%
and four additional license anesthesia
providers

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I think that's in here yes
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah but they're not dentists
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
the lead for additional providers
 
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.290 align:start position:0%
the lead for additional providers
okay

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
I have a question at this juncture
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
whether the Senate's
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
work at the moment we heard earlier that
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate is currently engaged in uh
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
amending or whatever do we know whether
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be working at Cross
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
purposes with what the Senate is doing
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
or duplicating what they're doing is
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
there some way we can coordinate uh the
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
actions of this subcommittee our
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee and the Senate as well with
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
regard to their bill because it seems
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
like we're kind of getting someplace
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
here with this deliberation your
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
participation the two of you is very
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to my understanding of where I
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
think we should be going but to the
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
degree that the Senate is doing the same
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
thing or not quite the same thing I
 
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:00.380 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
not well advised to proceed without
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
coordinating with them
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
by May representative
 
00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:07.849 align:start position:0%
by May representative
um

00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
so originally uh my understanding was
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 147 was just to deal with
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
the membership of the board as well as
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
to create the permit structure for
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
facilities at some point language was
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
added which is the language in Senate
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill 91.
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think from the board's perspective
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's important to address the facility
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
issue as well as establishment of the
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee and I think because they
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
already have the waiver Authority it's
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
not important to include that language
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
instead of Bill 147 that could be
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
addressed Senate Bill 91 if so inclined
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
but I think the board does desire to
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
move forward with establishment of
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
facility permits
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
just as long as we're coordinating
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
what's happening and that we're not
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it won't be coming out of
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
until January right so okay well then
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
let's get done let's get done what we
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
can do here that's
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that to the degree
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
that the the statute already permits
 
00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:16.460 align:start position:0%
some of these things uh you know
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and I are both on
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative committee on
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh which uh we'll
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
be hearing the proposal of the Dental
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
Board in the rules package that they're
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
working on so I think we have uh
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're kind of are getting
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
our feet on the ground here yeah as a as
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
long as the board has the authority to
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
issue waivers
 
00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:45.290 align:start position:0%
issue waivers
then

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
they're covered for whether they choose
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
to deny all of them or approve all of
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
them because it's
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
their knowledge that determines whether
 
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.170 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much um two
 
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.530 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much um two
things

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just want to make sure that
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is aware
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the history of section H so it was
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
pre previously section g it was passed
 
00:44:28.569 --> 00:44:28.579 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the reason that it was passed was
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
because the Dental Board has always had
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
the authority to to and to give
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
anesthesia permits to dentists that's
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
always been the board's empowerment by
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature but there was a movement
 
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:44.180 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
that it should be a requirement a
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislative statutory requirement that
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
dentists have to have a second
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
anesthesia provider under 13 no matter
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
what even if the board says they can
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
they put the exemption in so that the
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
board Earth so that the board could
 
00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:03.859 align:start position:0%
exempt oral surgeons and dentist
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists but no other dentist
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
can get that exemption before 2018
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
the board could give an anesthesia
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
permit to any dentist to give anesthesia
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
to any age
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
so it was really in 2018 that it became
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
a statutory thing where uh the the
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
proponents of that bill wanted to
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the board from being able to
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
give permits to give anesthesia to
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
children under 13 unless they had a
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
second provider but then we got in the
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
exemption for oral surgeons in
 
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
by deleting this from the the bill we
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
are not deleting it from the current
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
statute we are saying we are not going
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
to change the current statute
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that so
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
is that is is does that meet your your
 
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.870 align:start position:0%
is that is is does that meet your your
concerned

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
Mike my concerns were just that there
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
there were voices within the Senate that
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
were adamant that the legislature should
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
again intervene statutorily to take the
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh the power away from the board to
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
provide these permits so I guess when
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
you go once in Senate Bill 91 which
 
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:20.470 align:start position:0%
you go once in Senate Bill 91 which
talks

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want to jump to a conclusion
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay yeah as long as long as as long as
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
the Senate will be in agreement with
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
taking that part out then no no we're
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
just not going to make any changes to
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
current law in that area okay they're
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
trying to make changes in that and I
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
figure we'll we'll give them a clean
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
slate and let them work on it
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe I just make one more comment uh
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
once they have to decide once they
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
finish their fight Madam chair may just
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
make one one more comment
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
um in general I I really like what um Dr
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
Tebow proposed about the anesthesia
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee the composition of it the only
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is I know we had had
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
some discussions and I don't know how Dr
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
Ludington feels about this but my
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
understanding was there would be an
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
anesthesia committee it would have a
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
chair who would be a dentist there would
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
be an ex-officio member who would be the
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
anesthesia Provider from the Dental
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
Board and then the other three members
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
anyone dentist nurse anesthetist
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
whomever that was my understanding but I
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how Dr Ludington feels about
 
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.349 align:start position:0%
don't know how Dr Ludington feels about
that

00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
um well in the practical sense I think
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
it would I think the board if they had
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
an anesthesia provider would allow that
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
had to happen however right now we don't
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
and so to handcuff the board to only
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
allow that person to go I think it
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
should be amended to just have a
 
00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:44.099 align:start position:0%
representative from the board and I'm
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
sure the board would send someone that
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
is involved in the anesthesia part of it
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
so they would take it upon themselves
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
when that position is filled to to do
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
that but right now the way it is if that
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
happens we have no one that we can send
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
so there is as the anesthesia provider
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the board that position hasn't opened
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
yet and so we would create kind of a a
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
vacancy that we couldn't fill legally
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't send just any member
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
of the board having been on the board
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
realizing that no one's going to
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
volunteer for that position over and
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
above the person that's qualified they
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
would automatically do that but to put
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
it in the legislative terms I think
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
would would if that member wasn't
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
available the board couldn't supplement
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
someone else it was it could do that the
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
the bill says that it's one dentist
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
member of the board okay who has a
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
permit to administer anesthesia which
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
sounds like your tradition then it says
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
four additional dentists permitted to
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
administer anesthesia and the suggestion
 
00:48:51.609 --> 00:48:51.619 align:start position:0%
is to change four additional
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
anesthesia providers
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
appointed by the board no my thing is
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
the board member that's sent should be
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
um a board member period not have the
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
board member that has anesthesia
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
experience because as of right now we
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
have eight members none of them have
 
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:09.740 align:start position:0%
that experience so therefore we couldn't
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
run the committee and um so okay so you
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
want to delete the requirement that the
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
dentist from the board member have the
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
permit right
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
and you're okay with four additional
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
providers yes
 
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.130 align:start position:0%
providers yes
okay

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
Dr Tebow has his hand up I think we
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
should hear from him
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
may I just make one last Quick comment I
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
apologize I know one thing that came up
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
with the public hearing too was um
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
I guess how this would be implemented so
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
if you pass this uh Bill and it requires
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
that one of the board members has an
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
anesthesia permit currently
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
none of them do so would someone be
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
forced off the board or would that just
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
wait till someone resigns
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
well we'll go with one board member and
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
then if you happen to get somebody with
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I know we're not dealing with uh
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
section H totally off the board but
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
but I would like to also comment on
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
I would also like to comment on the um
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
section that you were just referring to
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
line 12 with regards to the anesthesia
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that with regards to the
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
anesthesia I think it's very important
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee be made up of
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
members of uh people that provide
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
anesthesia regardless of whether they're
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
a CRNA a physician a dentist or an oral
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
surgeon I think it needs to be made up
 
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:46.700 align:start position:0%
of everybody because in this Arena
 
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:50.300 align:start position:0%
having different perspectives uh I think
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
facilitates education and that education
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
um uh probably very beneficial to the
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
board when they're making decisions with
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
regards to that you know Dr Abel is an
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon myself being a nurse
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist we have different
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
perspectives and I think that
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
perspective will help guide the board of
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
I I want to weigh in on this issue of
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
the second provider yes I I I'm totally
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh on board with the idea that you don't
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
want to have one person only in that
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
operating room uh when something an
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
emergency comes you you simply cannot
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
have only one person
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh I agree yeah I think that has to be
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.859 --> 00:51:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
then let's leave it
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair one of the things that that
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
law allowed us to have a blanket
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
exemption which
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
the board's Council and through the
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
audit was found that that was not
 
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:30.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate so that's why we're making
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
changes to the to the rules as a as as
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
it is right now because the blanket
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
exemption is inappropriate for for
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
maintaining the safety of of the public
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
yes sir the
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
the law says may exempt dentists who are
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
board certified whatever
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
the interpretation that you can exempt
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
all dentists who are so
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
qualified is
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
not correct I mean you can't give a
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
blanket exemption right well we were you
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
could still exempt them one at a time or
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
for specific occasions right which is
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right and we were
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
scolded on that although it happened
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
prior to me being there I still got
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
scolded for it I think which is okay at
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we're going to
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.470 align:start position:0%
correct that
um

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
Madam chair would you suggest us
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
repealing that exemption as soon as
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
possible or wait until we have the other
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
rule in place if it's inappropriate to
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
give blanket exemptions you should
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably repeal it quickly okay and say
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
that individuals
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
May apply for specific exemption I
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate your advice because that's
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's what needs okay thank you
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
although I'm not a lawyer I only pretend
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
to be one but it would seem to say that
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
you may exempt them but
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
um that's okay thank you for that yeah
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
and that's the current law that they
 
00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:09.859 align:start position:0%
they may accept Madam chair
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
yep as a former Child Welfare worker and
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
the mother of a pediatric nurse
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
practitioner with her doctorate degree I
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
would say act now okay thank you very
 
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
would say act now okay thank you very
much

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:30.410 align:start position:0%
much
mm-hmm

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
