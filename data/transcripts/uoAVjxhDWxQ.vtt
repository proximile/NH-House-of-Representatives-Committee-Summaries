00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
correct is correct H as anybody would
 
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
anybody like to give us a a brief uh

doing okay so put your yeah good morning
 
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so we have a a
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
study committee on
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
um uh looking at RSA chapters 426 and
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
434 uh at our last meeting we worked our
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
way through uh 426 we found some things
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
that uh can be eliminated some things
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
that a couple of things that need a
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of adjustment some things
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
that are working just fine um and uh
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
next week uh not actually not next week
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
um this afternoon uh as as rep cron so
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
kindly reminded me U we have another
 
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
meeting and we're going to be at that
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
point we're going to be looking at 4:34
 
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
my guess is that 4:34 will'll probably
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
have even more things that can be
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh and uh some things that
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
can be retained and may need some
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
updating and then we will come up with a
 
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 align:start position:0%
report and some legislation and um
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%

monitoring the rules for the waste water
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
based on the the work that was done last
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
last time Dees is going to come and talk
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
to us about how that Ru Mak process is
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
going what rules they're coming up with
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
to improve groundwater security around
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
in and around waste water
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
plants or waste waste plant waste
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
facilities landfills thank
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
else oh representative ger thank you
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
very much uh for the study committee on
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
the unlimited area uh permits out of
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
state trash that the the chair was uh
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
kind enough to come and talk to us about
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
last week we'll have our final meeting
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
next week to pull together a report uh
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things we found in terms of
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with out estate trash is is to
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
try to limit it there kind of three
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
options one is uh you set stricter rules
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
for everybody which would be in state
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
and out of state another would be there
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
are various possibilities where you
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
could challenge uh the interstate
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
commerce clause and then take your
 
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
chances in court uh or there's the
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
possibility that future landfills are
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
owned uh publicly either by the state or
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
a political subdivision and then you
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
could restrict out of state trash
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
without worrying about the interstate
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
commerce clause so we're going to meet
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
next week we're going to draft up our
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
report and make some recommendations
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
that uh anyone else representative Bixby
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm also on the study committee
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
for um finding more Slaughter facilities
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
for amendable and non-amendable animals
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
and um this is uh continues to be a
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
complicated issue uh one it looks like
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
one thing that will help is if we um
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
change in the definition of livestock in
 
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
statute so that uh non-amendable and
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
amendable are treated separately and
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
that will allow the uh the slaughter of
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
non-edible species in the uh state to
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
not track directly with USDA because the
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
USDA doesn't for some reason care about
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
non amendable species at least not to
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
the point of wanting to ma manage the
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
slaughter um and and uh in terms of
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
coming up with more solutions for um for
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
amenable animals it remains challenging
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that's we're going to be getting
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
some input unfortunately not in person
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
from the USDA local um food and F fsis
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
person um to uh find out more about how
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
the slaughter regulations work so we're
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
basically going to be submitting
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
questions to him he's going to give us
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
written replies um unfortunately he
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to come up so um which would
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
have been much easier because a back and
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
forth is better okay thank you very much
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
for that anyone else representative
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
Davis you're on the epr study committee
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
are you not good morning thank you madam
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
chair I think our study's done the test
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony was very one-sided and I I
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have seen some more
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from the other side but I I I
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
believe we're going to be split U two
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
two for it two I don't know if it
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to it but but my opinion I
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh that they're not taking the right
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
approach to it I I don't I I think that
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
it's not probably uh something that I
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
would I think the free market should
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
determine what
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know what how we go forward with
 
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.310 align:start position:0%
uh you know what how we go forward with
this

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah we we're pretty much split
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right anyone else for any of
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
the other study committees or
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that have been going on no
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you all uh who are
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
serving on these study committees and
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittees for your work uh it's very
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
important and U I'm I'm happy to hear
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
that that there's some progress being
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
made on
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
these with that being said um let's uh
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
start off with um discussion about HB 37
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study best
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
practices for companion animal groomers
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
and as we left this last time um we had
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
um instead of going along and uh um
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
putting together a a committee to study
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
best practices for companion animal
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
groomers that we would put together a
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
Consumer's Guide to choosing an animal
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
groomer and have that posted up on a um
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
State website probably through the
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um I came up with a a draft
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
and distributed to
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
distributed it to our members and I'm
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
looking for uh your feedback back and uh
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
if there's any editss or changes or
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
whatever let's discuss
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
Katon uh thank you ma'am the uh I read
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
through your draft and to me that makes
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense than uh than having a
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee and as wide as we can publish
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
that and get that out there it gets the
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
information into the hands of the
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
consumer so that they can make an
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
informed decision so I I think you've
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
hit the me on head and uh I like what
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
you've done thank you I uh I had input
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
from the um American Kennel Club the
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
dogs uh group um and also um there's a a
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
a cat groomer who uh who also gave me
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
some uh resources and also provided some
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
inputs uh some edits to the first draft
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
so I have I I distributed out to
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
everybody uh a first draft and then also
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
sent out the edited version um and I
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
know representative kto you had some
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
comments I did thank you I'm bring that
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
up real quick sure thank you madam chair
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
um it's not so much I like the idea of
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
having this out there um but on number
 
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.910 align:start position:0%
having this out there um but on number
one

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a misleading thing
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
because if you ask an establishment how
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
long they've been in business business
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
it could be that they've been in
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
business for 50 years but a new owner
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
just took over ah and so they've only
 
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
been in business for a day okay um and
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is um and maybe
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
there's someone that worked for another
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
business and then branched out on their
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
own and if they've only been in business
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
for a week uh people may not you know I
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
think start by asking friends families
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
and neighbors is more
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
important and I understand maybe asking
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
how long the establishment has been in
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
business but that can actually be kind
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
of controversial based on how it's
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
brought about and you could you know
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
someone could say well this has been in
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
business for 50 years and you have a bad
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
owner that just started and you could
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
bring your vet pet there or you could
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
have someone that's only been in
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
business for a week and they've been
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
doing it for 20 years um and that was my
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
only comment all right um well any kind
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
of uh change to the language that you
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
have for that section I'd be happy to
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate into the into this guide
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I think that um one
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
of the things I like about this is it
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide just one Avenue for
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
figuring out what uh what the what your
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
best option is it provides a whole lot
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
of different approaches and uh and
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
implied in that is or might actually be
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
be stated explicitly I can't remember
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
but uh but that indicates that you don't
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
just ask for you know recommendation you
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
do a a number of different steps to
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
cross reference so that uh you know if
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
you you know if you ask how long they've
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
been in business and you you know it's
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
been the business has been around for um
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
50 years but you ask uh neighbors or you
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
know you ask other for other information
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you say yeah well we like the old
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
guy but this new guy is terrible then
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
then you're that's going to give you the
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
cross referencing information you need
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
so I I think that um having the the
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
multiple resources and indicating that
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
you that people should pursue more than
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
one of the these Avenues as a way of
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
getting their their information is
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
probably sufficient and U my more
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
General comment is that I think you did
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
a really great job on this and I I think
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
this is thank you and and I also have a
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
question which is have you talked with
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
the Department about what it would take
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
to get this put
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
up thank first of all thank you for uh
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh your comments and uh yes I have had
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
uh some conversation with commissioner
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
Jasper on this he was um very tentative
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not this is something
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
that belongs on their website he was
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
saying that he thought perhaps maybe
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
this should go on the state
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
veterinarians website or some uh you
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
know where where they do um Licensing in
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
the state um we were going to have some
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
further conversation about um where it
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
should go so um I'll have to have
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
further conversation with the
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner on that representative ktoa
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um one site that
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
maybe uh where it really would work well
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
is uh and you could talk with them is
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
the uh governance Council on the Humane
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
treatment of animals website ah okay um
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
because that really does talk to the
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
effect of humanely treating animals and
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to make sure that our
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
pet groomers are doing that exactly that
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
and it Encompass would Encompass that so
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
just a thought okay U and it could be
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
put on multiple
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
websites yeah I I I agree with that I
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
think probably you know wherever we can
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
put it up on the state websites that
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
would make it um accessible to the
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
consumers and that the general public
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
when um and I did
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
get hang on one second I did get uh
 
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.949 align:start position:0%
get hang on one second I did get uh
feedback

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
from uh the prime
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%

and

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
um he his his comments to me was um your
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
guide should he wished he could have
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
attended the work session today um and
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
he said the guide should provide
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
consumers and groomers alike with a
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
solid framework from which to understand
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the importance of what is necessary to
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
provide proper grooming services for our
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
pets based on the tragedy that motivated
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and similar conversations with
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
res residents whose pets were also
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
mistreated my only thought on your
 
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
mistreated my only thought on your
excellent

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
guide is flipping number two research
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
and check credentials and number one
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations and how long the
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
establishment has been in business so
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
just to flip those two
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
I'm that's his his comment for an edit
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you and all the members of the
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee again for your work on this
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
bill so he's he's real happy with this
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I think he did a great job okay great
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair um I'm
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Murray no that's
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay um one of the so that was one of
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
the other things I was thinking about
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
was obviously we know that this is a
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
guide that could be in part geared
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
towards the consumer but also then for
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the groomers uh where would there be you
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
know I understand we're saying the the
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
governor's Council for Humane treatment
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
of animals could it also potentially go
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that um is accessible
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
then for those um groomers themselves so
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that they have it and they're aware that
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
these are questions that their customers
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
and consumers may ask yeah well I think
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
they can access the state websites as
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
well but I also know that any of the
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
organizations the animal organizations
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
that they may belong to have their own
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
um guidelines on groomers and grooming
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and some of them even have um mechanisms
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
to do credentialing for them so I
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
believe they uh they already probably
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
are well aware of um resources for best
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
practices for their for their
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
craft representative
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
Howard good morning good morning Madam
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
chair um given that we are sort of
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
taking this alternative route to avoid
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
legisl legislating regulations I think
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
that um the we don't need to fret too
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
much about number one I mean there's a
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
whole list of things to consider and and
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
and I agree with um all here that this
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
is beautifully put together and
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient so um I think that we don't
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
need to worry about uh about uh whether
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
somebody you know assumes a business and
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
can assume that those number of years
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
even though they they're they've only
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
been in it for one
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
year okay thank you anyone
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
else oh representative Penza good
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
morning morning so there's just a couple
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
additions that I would love
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
um they're already kind of in yours and
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
they would be added so one is like um
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know in regards with the pet that is
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
nervous and stuff about may I stay and
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
watch while you grew my dog like a
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
question to be asked so um another one
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
is specifically experience with um a
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
dog's breed which can go in another
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph in here and then the other one
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
is specifically about these are just
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
like questions to ask um what kind of
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
training do they have so um you know
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
because of course some groomers I have a
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
very good friend she completely learned
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
on the job you know through an
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship and that can be just as
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
good as you know getting of course the
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
safe training and all those other types
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
of things so um I have like three
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
sentences and if you want I'll grab
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and send them to you a little
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
later today it sounds wonderful send me
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
whatever um addition you'd like to have
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
included and I'll do that I'll come up
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
with a final draft and then um send it
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
out along to all of you and then get in
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
touch with I will get in touch with um
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper and we'll discuss uh
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
where to place this on state
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
websites okay any other represent
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
dsy uh yes thank you madam chair um I
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
was struck by the number of resources
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
that were listed and and I do think you
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
did an excellent job but my question
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
became is would there have been a
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
different avenue to take to get the same
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
result without it going through a
 
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
legislative committee um you know I mean
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of time has been allocated to this
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
I think we've come up with a great
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
solution but the fact of the matter is
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
if anybody would have done a Google
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
search they probably could have come up
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know with at least one of these
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
resources MH so so my question here is
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
there you know should we be educating
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
our representatives to or are there are
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
are there resources within you know the
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
state house that they could go to to
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it should be a
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill or there should be some other
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue I think we need to explore that
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:25.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank
you

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
Ma all right
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions concerns
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
then we can move on to HB 122 which is
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
relative to microenterprise home kitchen
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
operations and I will um turn this over
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
to representative ktoa who has presented
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
us with an
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you madam chair um so
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
what I've done is we've adding a new
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
section called homemade
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
food um and there's some definitions in
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
there uh it's on your desk if you give
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
everyone a chance to take a look at it
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we're talking
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
about uh someone making homemade food
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
and then transferring it or selling it
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
to an informed end consumer and just to
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
let you know an informed and consumer
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
means a person who is the last person to
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
purchase a product
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
does not resell the product and has been
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
informed that the product is not
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
licensed permitted certified packaged
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
labeled or inspected per any official
 
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
regulations and right now we have people
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
with bake sales we have people with
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
community events and there really is no
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
true legal Avenue for them to be doing
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
selling you know having that food there
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
because they can't technically I mean
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the lemonade stand
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
right you're making your lemonade and
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
technically legally you can't sell it to
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
the ined end consumer who's going by to
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
purchase that cup of
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
lemonade so um it's pretty specific it
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
excludes retail
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
establishments it excludes wholesale
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
food manufacturing
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
establishments a dairy or manufactured
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know it
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
excludes certain things but it includes
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
your traditional Community social events
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
and there is a list of those on on that
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
is on page
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
two um I think this accomplishes what we
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
were trying to accomplish especially
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the EP thing the episode that
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
happened up in Meredith where the person
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
was uh donating food from her kitchen to
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
people that couldn't afford it she
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't even selling it um but she was
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
donating it and I think that the
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
consumer at some point has to take
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility and as long as they're
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
informed of what's in the product they
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not licensed or
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
permitted um why can't you buy from your
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
Katon uh thank you m'am uh
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative kto I think you you uh
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
you hit what I wanted to see in the bill
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
which is a couple of things um one uh
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
consumer awareness if the consumer is
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
aware of what they're buying then then
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
it should be allowed uh for for them to
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
do that uh the second thing is you took
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
out the controversial part about the
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
milk specifically so that's included in
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
other law that we don't have to include
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
in here and uh third it opens up um it
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
opens up the Avenues for private people
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
that want to do things on on their own I
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
think that's uh in the spirit of of what
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray good morning
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things first I and
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
not I want to be clear that I think what
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
we were talking a little bit about a
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
couple of different things one of which
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
was donations to nonprofit entities or
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
organizations which I do believe is
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
covered through the bill Emerson Good
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
Samaritan act so that's I think a
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
separate entity and conversation unto
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
itself when we're talking about this
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
issue I did want to ask
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um what would be the me mechanism to
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that some somebody has been
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
informed is there a way to make sure is
 
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
informed is there a way to make sure is
that

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
that
a

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
um do could could there be any sort of
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
enti like situation where somebody says
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
oh well I didn't see that or I wasn't I
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know um and then are we getting
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
into a situation where there there's an
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
assumed liability there
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
because I guess that's the question okay
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I represent Mari so an
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
informed and consumer is someone who
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
speaks with the producer or their agent
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
about what the food is I mean the
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions now I'm going to speak from
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
personal experience and also in
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
general most
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
people that are doing any type of home
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
business or anything like that are not
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
looking to harm anybody and in a small
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire if if you do
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
one thing that's not so good everybody
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
in your community knows it and you're
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
done I mean it's really um it's kind of
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know word travels bad news travels
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
really fast um and I think that we have
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
to let people take responsibility at
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
some point we cannot
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
regulate every little thing in someone's
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
life and I think this is one of
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
them we're not saying that they're
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
selling these you know in retail stores
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
or anything
 
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.990 align:start position:0%
or anything
else

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
and and if you want to go and be able to
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
sell certain things then you can go
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
under the Homestead Act this is for very
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
small private businesses or people just
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
trying to make an End meat maybe there's
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
a mom that says you know what I need a
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
few extra dollars to buy my groceries
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
this week and if I can just make a
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
couple of meals for my neighbor and
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
maybe she can buy them I mean we as
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
people bring food to our neighbors
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
already and technically if you if you're
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
looking at the Spirit of the law you're
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
really not supposed to be doing
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
that because you're it's from a private
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
home and you're bringing it to an
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
informed end consumer and that's what
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
about representative Murray um follow up
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
if I may sure um and then uh just one
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
other quick question I had was just for
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
continuity sake I we there's I I think
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
we briefly touched on this there's one
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
mention of the word Cottage food
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
operation and the rest it it is
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned as Homestead food so I just
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
for clarity sake is that a different
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
thing or is that the same thing in
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
language so um I would I'm not sure why
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
that is but I will look into that uh
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
with OS thank you
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair uh the the
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
question I have is a question I often
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
have is when we talk about local control
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
um in in the state and we generally say
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
that we prefer local control but I'm
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
often confused with legislation that not
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
only forbids a state agency from
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
acquiring things but also forbids
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
localities from being able to uh to do
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
some of these things as well so to say
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
that a political subdivision is barred
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
from uh having any requirements for
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
example uh pertaining to preparation of
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
food as an example um I wonder about so
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
my question is uh aside from forbidding
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
a state agency from doing it what is the
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the the virtue of also
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
us saying that localities can't make
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative jamer and I understand
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
what you're saying however this goes
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
to this isn't for someone who is making
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of jam and selling it under the
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption license or anything
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
like this this is for private basically
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
private individuals or it's being made
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
in a private home or on a on a small
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
farm and being sold to an informed and
 
00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
farm and being sold to an informed and
consumer

00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you know to do all the L
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know you know maybe somebody doesn't
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
have the time or they're just making a
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
meal and they don't have the time to
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
print out all the labels but they're
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
telling their informed and consumer hey
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know I just made a spaghetti with uh
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
some meatballs and this is the what I
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
put in the meatballs and this is the
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
sauce I used and I used this type of
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
meat instead of writing it all out on a
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
label and you have to label it by weight
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
technically is how you're supposed to do
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
that uh this takes this onerous off of
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that person and I under you
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
know there's still local control if
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're running a basically a business
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's still local control and State
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
Control under the homestead food act
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
this is a separate entity and there are
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of people doing some things like
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
this but everyone is breaking the law
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
and aren't we trying to St
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
people from being not in compliance with
 
00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:32.789 align:start position:0%
people from being not in compliance with
the

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
that so representative kto I have a
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
question as to
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the part where it says a producer may
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
not donate milk to a traditional
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
Community social event does that mean
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
that say in Washington New Hampshire
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
um eart Farms couldn't donate milk to a
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh their local you know event that's
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
going on in town and why thank you madam
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
chair and I excluded Dairy because I
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want to because dair's one of
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
those subjects that we always get into
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh especially when dealing with raw milk
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
and things like that um and uh
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
because but I can take that out there
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
was no particular reason I was just
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
trying to be mindful of everything dairy
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh because I do know of you know Dairy
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
Producers that do donate their product
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
for local events that go on and um I
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
would hate to see them not be able to do
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
that um Madam chair it was not my intent
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
to say that they could not donate them
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
but they could not donate him under the
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
exemption of not having the milk label
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay um they would have to be
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
under this Homestead or the dairy
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
regulations for raw milk would we be
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
able to then amend this line to say a
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
producer may not donate milk to a
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
traditional Community social event
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
unless the milk is labeled and packaged
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
properly I would most certainly be happy
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
to do that okay great thank you
 
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
to do that okay great thank you
representative

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah I think I need a little
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
education on this because I thought the
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
original bill was um focused on people
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
who sold their meals and I and I know
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
that this is part of it but now we're
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
talking about you know um providing food
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
to a neighbor free of charge and I'm not
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure that that was what was what the
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
original bill was issued at was was
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
focused on so you know I guess I don't
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
have a problem um with not having any
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
inspections and having an informed
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
consumer because I noticed when we had
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing we had
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
219 towns have no food inspection okay
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
some restaurants never get or they get
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
inspected so infrequently you know and
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
if you want to be a consumed Informer
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
and go to a restaurant go to the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
bathroom first and see how they manage
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
that and if it's not up to your
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
standards then you may not want to eat
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
there I mean so you know we have all of
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
these ways of doing that but you know
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just concerned that this might
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
confuse the law or or might the the way
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's written might add more confusion
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
than clarification and I don't know I
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking that question okay
 
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.710 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking that question okay
representative

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair is this is
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
this um by the assumption that the the
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
consumer is informed in the end um does
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
liability representative kto you may
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
reply thank you um I think um I don't
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
know if that would release the person
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
making it from any
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if they would actually
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
be able to get insurance if they weren't
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
being if they wanted to be insured they
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
would have to follow different laws
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
because you know if they were concerned
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
about that um I think that's extremely
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know they're taking on a personal
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this so um as we all
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
know we can be informed and consumers of
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
anything but it doesn't release the
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
person the companies of negligence or
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
liability either right so um I don't
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
believe that would be the case and
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
especially in the terms with insurance
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to then go under the
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
Homestead Act I would
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
believe representative
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
kraton yeah I me just read back what I
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
think you just said in other words if I
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
make my spaghetti M and I tell the
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
people I just made this spaghetti but my
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
meat was rancid and I knew the meat was
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
rancid then I'm still responsible for
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
that because I I was negligent even
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
though I said it was the meat that I got
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
out of the refrigerator but it still ran
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you're liable for
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation I would think yeah I'm
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
sorry go
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Murray um thank you
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I guess that's part partly
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
my question so if if I heard you
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
correctly in your statement what you
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
were saying was that um insurance
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
um if an entity was was selling
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
uninspected food but sought insurance
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
how would those two jive with one
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
another like I I guess that's what I'm
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
additional um so I haven't spoken with
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance company
 
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
the insurance company
specifically

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
however it would be my assumption and we
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
all know what we assumptions do they
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
always make fools of us
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
however uh I know that it is some
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
insurance has a list of things that they
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
do not cover in our farm policies and I
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that if we weren't
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
following a specific thing and this was
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
a private thing this would not fall
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
under like for us a farm policy uh so
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
this would probably have to go under a
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
separate like homeowners policy or
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
something to that effect and I don't
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
know uh because I don't have a regular
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
homeowners policy so I'm not sure about
 
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.750 align:start position:0%
homeowners policy so I'm not sure about
insurance

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't trying to get into the
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
insurance business or try and figure
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
that out but
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
Penza so about 10 years ago I had a good
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
friend that lived across the street that
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh went to school she made cakes and her
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
her in and she did them she had a full
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen in her basement and she was
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
insured underneath her homeowners policy
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
she was talking to my husband about it
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
one night so um if that helps but I
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
think that this whole bill in a sense is
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
just giving people a a guideline that is
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
is necessary so um and to be honest if
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to sue you for anything
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
they can sue you so unfortunately we
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
just live in that culture so um you know
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
I've been sick many times from a
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant and there's never been
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
anything that I've gotten from that so
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know I trust homemade food probably
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
better than some of the restaurant
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
stuffs so I think that this I think this
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
was a good job thanks
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
Barbara representative Bixby yeah I
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
think that um the my guess is that there
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
are probably
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
Insurance getting getting this under
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
getting this allowed under your home
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
owner's insurance may be problematic or
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
under your liability umbrella whatever
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh that is that is something that the
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
person that is doing it has to take on
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
as a risk
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
I think that uh there should be a line
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
in here that says that uh the um that
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
this this section doesn't of law would
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
not absolve the homeowner the the
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
provide producer of any
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
liability um so um
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
basically I it uh you know if if the
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
rancid meat thing were to happen then
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
you know that would that would be you
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
know the the home owner the producer
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
would be liable in that situation and I
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
I think that there there should not that
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
that it should explicitly say you know
 
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:06.630 align:start position:0%
that it should explicitly say you know
there's

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
no this doesn't excuse people from doing
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
thing but you know that being said I I
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
actually like the idea of the Bill thank
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
sorry okay uh any other questions or
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
comments regarding this no um yeah I
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
think you did a great job with this um
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to uh seeing the
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
amended version that we can then take
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
action on next
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%

rodenticides representative Bixby I

believe um okay you may have something
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
about that yes I I have a a brief piece
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
of information I uh discussed this in uh
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
a bit further with uh director Russo and
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like the uh Federal
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
Regulations are likely to be coming down
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
in uh December or
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
January uh we had a the the draft of
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
those regulations was in the report that
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
we saw last month um
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that those what the feds
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
are proposing is more thorough than what
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
would happen if we just asked the
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
department to uh to make these make them
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
restricted okay uh and anything that
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
happens with with legislation for us
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
won't be enacted any sooner than July
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh so um so if there if the feds still
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
aren't doing doing anything by say late
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
late spring then we can uh go to we can
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
ask the the pesticide control board to
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
consider uh doing something at the state
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
level and do it through their existing
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
authorization rather than making a law
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
and telling them to do it so I think
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't need
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
26 uh so um and i' I'd like to uh thank
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
the board and for putting together a
 
00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.430 align:start position:0%
the board and for putting together a
study

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee to uh to study this and to and
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
um sort of thank them for their uh the
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
thorough report that they put
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
out okay thank you for that and um I am
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that uh assessment of
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
the situation so I uh
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for for following up on all of
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
that and your diligence and your work on
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
that issue and also to
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
um Mr rouso for uh his work and his
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee's work on this thank you all
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
right any any other questions or
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
comments regarding this HB
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
326 all
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
right um so then it is I guess in in our
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
opinion that next week we would' be itl
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh moving on to HB 369
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
establishing a task force to provide
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
energy relief on
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
farms representative Bixby yes so um uh
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
I had some discussions with uh Ken laali
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
and Kelly mccadam at uh UNH uh extension
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
about um what would make sense to do
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
with this um and they thought that so
 
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.710 align:start position:0%
with this um and they thought that so
currently

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh John Porter who is a longtime uh
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
member and now an ameritus member of
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension uh has been
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
working with Farms um maybe once every
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
week or two uh to make suggestions in
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
terms of uh Farm Technology and energy
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
and some including some energy um
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
systems work but uh that's that hardly
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
covers the the need within the farming
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
Community for advising on uh Energy
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
Systems and um and and other Tech Farm
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
Technology like Barn ventilation and uh
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know um manure management that sort
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
of thing so
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
um so uh in discussion with the
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
extension folks um we decided that it
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
what would really make sense is have a
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh program that would uh
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
that would deal with both Farm Energy
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
Systems and infrastructure design advice
 
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.829 align:start position:0%
Systems and infrastructure design advice
and

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I based the the structure of
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the bill on the way that the division of
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
forest and lands does uh works with
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to have County
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
Foresters so uh at at this point in the
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
division of forest and land statutes it
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
says that the um they have a declared
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of uh the forest management
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
being a benefit to the state I basically
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
copied their Declaration of purpose and
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
trans transformed that to farm uh energy
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
technology uh
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
and uh under the forest and Lance
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
program uh the department of force and
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
lands has a memorandum of understanding
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
with Cooper of extension to uh to to
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
support uh County Foresters in every in
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
every County to provide the education to
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
land to uh wood lot owners and and other
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
um and other um in interested parties in
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
in forests so uh this would provide this
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
would be in the Department of
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
Agriculture it would create the program
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
would reside in the Department of
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and they would have a me
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with uh
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
extension to have one field specialist
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
who would work with Farmers to uh
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
essentially assess the um the on Farm
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and energy needs and come
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
up with essentially a holistic uh view
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
of uh how that could be improved and
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
then provide the uh farmer
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
with uh uh the uh resources uh the
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
information resources to uh find out
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
what Grant so provide you know
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
information about what grants are
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
existent uh what um what would be the
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
mechanis the available resources for
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
getting those grants written the field
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
specialist would not be a grant writer
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
but uh they you they would have they
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
would have ACC they would know who is
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
available for grant writing uh and uh
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
possib and also know which energy
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
Alternative Energy Supply ERS might um
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
be able to help out with the process of
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing re grants for exam for example
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so this would provide
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
a um basically advisory uh resource for
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
Farmers it is specifically for farmers
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
who are doing it as
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
a as a for-profit venture uh so uh I and
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
I've um the way that I dealt with that
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
was I defined Farmer for the purpose of
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
this section as being a farmer who's who
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
files a schedule F uh with their income
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
taxes uh so I'm ha I'm happy to take
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions and then I'd like to invite
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
Seth Wilner up to uh explain how the how
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
field Specialists work and how this how
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
this would be a Ben how this would um be
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that um M's first the uh Co-op
 
00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
extension could provide so um
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative Bixby
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I I see we have a number of
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions so representative Murray you
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
are first um thank you madam chair yes
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
so one question I did have was that I
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
see that we're we're depositing this
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
monies into a general fund but then
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
we're also standing up a
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh appropriation for um uh it
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
seems like salaries roll ups and
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
benefits um and one of the things that
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about is whether or not we
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
should be maybe establishing a non-aps
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for this entity if we are
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
expecting that um this is something that
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
will be available year after
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
year um I when I talked with the
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner he felt that it was not
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a separate uh
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for the uh for this and I
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
think I think I also discussed this with
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
suami and uh she also um said the
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
indication was that it was not that it
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
was uh a reasonable mechanism to have uh
 
00:50:24.799 --> 00:50:26.589 align:start position:0%
was uh a reasonable mechanism to have uh
a

00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
um no actually I talked with the LBA
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
about this so that's that's who I talked
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
to I talked to suami and she said to
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
talk to the LBA and I talked to the LBA
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
and they said that it would it was the
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to do it was to have uh
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
any uh if there so I one thing I didn't
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
mention was that when I talked with the
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
person at uh USDA who's in charge of the
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
reap grants she said it was likely that
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
we could get something like a 50% match
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
on the cost of this program so that's
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's why the question of donations
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
comes up so uh we may be able to get
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
half of the cost of this covered by the
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
feds um but there's not a guarantee of
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
that so uh so if there is um so if there
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
is grant money that will help support it
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
then that would be deposited in the
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
general fund and then be appropriated to
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
the department to pay for the costs
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ktoa thank you
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
big for taking my question
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about reports farm
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
income and
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
expenses Some Farms have a startup
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
period it could be 3 to five years
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
before they see any income um I think
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
that if you just had a schedule F on
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
there and not Define because you're
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
you're limiting that to people that have
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
farm income
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
um it's on page one it's on the first
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
page line and I think you're saying if
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you correctly represent
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
Murray yeah so what you're saying is
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
that they could be operating at a loss
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
for several years and so I'll give you
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
an example if someone wants to start a
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
Vineyard yeah Vineyards don't don't uh
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
produce grapes for three to four years
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
um basically just files a schedule and
 
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.950 align:start position:0%
um basically just files a schedule and
yes

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
Penza Barbara beat me to that one so the
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
criteria is um is 1040 schedule F and
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
how will the communication go out to um
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
um to all of these folks because of
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
course you know to announce this that
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is in place is it could be a
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
tremendous resource for several people
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
so that's my first question is how will
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
we communicate to them about this
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
program and then um the
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the salary the
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I just know that if this is
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
popular and it's one person and you
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
could have one or two farmers that are
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
really you know utilizing this and then
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
that the resources of that one person
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
will they have um will that's that
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
salaried person have resources within
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
the department to help them with this
 
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.630 align:start position:0%
the department to help them with this
process

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
too okay so the um represent Bixby yes
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
so um the the the $100,000 provides um
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
the salary benefits and also resources
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
for so um um travel resources and um
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
Computer Resources for the that that
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
typically goes along with an extension
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
position and I got that that number of
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
100,000 from uh the director from um
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
kenl Valley the director of extension so
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
I assume that he knows what it costs to
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
do a field specialist in terms of how do
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
we get the
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um uh how how does this get uh um
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
advertised and how do people know about
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
it how does extension balance the way
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
that balance balance it so that farmers
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
can the maximum number of farmers can
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it I think I'd like to
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
turn that over to um Seth wner from
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
extension so maybe we can bring him up
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and he can explain a little bit about
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
how field Specialists work in
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
extension thank you good morning and
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr Wilner good morning and thank
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair my name is Seth Wilner
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
I've been working with Cooperative
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
Extension for about 23 years now and I'm
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the farm business management sector
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that extension um would
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
be able to easily rise to this and get
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
word out we have County Educators in
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
every County all 10 counties then we're
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
backed Often by um Campus based
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
Specialists so we have relationships
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
with all the farms in each of the
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
counties we also have areas of expertise
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
so I work around the state in business
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
management often succession planning and
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
whole Farm planning the county- based
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
educator then would either identify a
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
farm and say Seth could you go work with
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
this Farm um and we would do the same
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
with this example here with the um
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
technology and um energy person or
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes if Farmers themselves meet
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
these people at Twilight meetings or
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
read news articles or whatever and they
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
call themselves so there's there's two
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in through the county agent
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
or the Farms go directly to to the
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
person with the specialty area
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
themselves then in terms of time
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
consumption so often times we will
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
work around the state and we'll begin
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
projects with the Farms give them some
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
homework come back to the Farms when
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
they've completed that um and and then
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
help them get to the next step or
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
connect them with the resource such as
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
USDA um nrcs um and or rural development
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
things of that effect and we don't write
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
the grants for the Farms themselves but
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly Usher them through the
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
process so there was a farm that
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully made the the first round
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
second round final round and we're
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
waiting to see if they're going to get
 
00:56:38.039 --> 00:56:39.190 align:start position:0%
waiting to see if they're going to get
about

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
$400,000 from the Northeast business
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
Dairy um Center uh Innovation Center to
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
effectively do similar to this upgrade
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
their equipment where they believe by
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
our calculations 30% increase in
 
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.670 align:start position:0%
our calculations 30% increase in
production

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
production
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
of bottled milk so about
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
$600,000 in gross revenue by low and
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
lowering their utility bill by about 700
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
a year so 700 a year is not much but
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't forget that's the increased
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
production they're going to save a full
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
day of production and so it's really
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
from the equipment um that we're going
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
to we suggested be modernized and their
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
production methods and that's not even
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
touching the Renewables you add
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
Renewables on that you really get
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
something so there's a lot of area for
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
um profitability and Improvement and
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
efficiencies here and that's just with
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
utilities you look at um technologies
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
that can save um Fuel and oil and so
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's substantial ability for
 
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.270 align:start position:0%
there's substantial ability for
savings

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Penza just a quick
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
followup so the resources so let's say
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a farmer and I'm looking and there
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
is you've provided provided the
 
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
information for a grant that's available
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
of course I have a lot of things that I
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
need to fill out um but you have someone
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be working with that
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
farmer the entire time and walking them
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
through the grant
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
process yes so as an
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
example I got the farm together that was
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
looking at this Innovation um expansion
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
Grant I said okay here's the strategy
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then who's going to do what roles
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities same actually what
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
we do with this succession plan which is
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
just so much work um so we have they
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
built an internal team we lead them
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
through that no question we're calling
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
and saying hey you're going to follow
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
through with that homework right that
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
was due two days ago oh yeah yeah I'm on
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
that and so sometimes you show up at the
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
farm you give them a nudge then you get
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
then you we've all reviewed grants and
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
extensions so then we're reviewing it or
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues are we're like I think I'm
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
not not really a strong argument here or
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
you need more data there
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
then we get feedback um from the
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
granting agency because there's multiple
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
rounds and we help them make strategy so
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
how will you respond to that feedback so
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
thanks to that effect representative
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair I I'm going
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
back to the $100,000 on page two lines
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
two and three and
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
four uh and I'm I'm just confused so
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
this is what it says is that $100,000
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
will be allocated to the
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
department and then it goes on to say
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the appropriation shall be used for
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
salary benefits expenses okay
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
so I got that but it's only for one year
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
so if I go hire Sally to do this job
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's only a oneye job because the
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation is only for one year is
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
that what am I missing something because
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to hire someone for one
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
year to do this right right so um
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
the um that's a good question and uh um
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
the uh I might need to talk with LBA in
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
terms of uh just to find out how to make
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
sure that this is a A continuing program
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
but in terms of um in terms of the
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
budget cycle this would be um this would
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
be uh something that in subsequent years
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
the um the director would the
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner would have to put into the
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
um The Damp the uh Department
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Bixby that in
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
line one um p on page two that prior to
 
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
line one um p on page two that prior to
the

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
word uh prior to the phrase the sum of
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
100,000 maybe we should say initially
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the sum of 100,000 for the fiscal year
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
ending is hereby appropriated and then
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the department uh
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
subsequently to include that in their
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
budget representative Murray thank you
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I guess that was sort of
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
where I was going with the the Nuance
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
between it being a general funded Thing
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
versus a dedicated fund um so to your
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
point you were saying it would be up to
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's discretion then from
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
here forward to allocate funding after
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
hearing uh so
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
um the way that it is phrased here yes
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to talk to I will talk to
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
LBA and find out how it needs to be
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
amended in order to make sure that it is
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
something that is an ongoing program
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay super representative kraton and and
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
for a followup just so I'm I'm clear so
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is we're going to
 
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.670 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is we're going to
spend

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and what we're hoping what we
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
believe is that that $100,000 will save
 
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.510 align:start position:0%
believe is that that $100,000 will save
or

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
enhance New Hampshire Farmers ability to
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
make money by hundreds of thousands of
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
dollars so we're expecting these grants
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
to come in based on this $100,000
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
investment for Farmers of your example
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
400,000 or whatever the grant
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
is I see savings for farmers
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
potentially realized in several ways we
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
did a um Benchmark study where we looked
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
at 17 New Hampshire Farms over four
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
years and utility costs and these were
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
direct Market vegetable Fruit and
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
Vegetable Farms minimum gross revenue
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
was 150,000 per year and then it went up
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
to 2 million so that was the
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
range utilities ranged between 8,000 to
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
31,000 a year and fuel cost range or
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
8,000 to 21,000 a year and fewer costs
 
01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
range from 9,000 to 31,000 per year
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
depending on and and that was the range
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we believe that we could get savings
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
help realize there what would that
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
be 4 five 7,000 a year maybe um and for
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
the direct Vegetable Farms things like
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
cool Bots things like setting up walking
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
coolers and having um different um zones
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration then the dairy farm Farms
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
have a higher um utility and they're
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
between I 10 and 50,000 a year as based
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
on the figures that I know but they're
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
not I those aren't as precise as I want
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
so we'd get help realize savings on the
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
farm additionally there's a lot of money
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
out there at least now and projected for
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the next five years um where Farms can
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
go after grants to augment their
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
technology what is it that they need and
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
how will it help them save so for
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
example this $400,000 Grant they wanted
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
specific amounts of how many kilowatt
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
hours you would save and they also
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
wanted specific amounts of how much
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
diesel to effectively heating oil but
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
diesel to fuel you would save and so we
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
were able to go and help them assess
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
that the Agro the agriculture
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
Engineering also allow us to um help
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
them design buildings that would be more
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
energy efficient but then there's this
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
Gap as well that um representative Bixby
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the bill where if I have
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
to go to you the salesperson for advice
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
you may not be giving me advice that is
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
in my best interest you may be giving me
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
advice that's in the bottom line for you
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
your best interest we can look at that
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
and say hm not sure um you might want to
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
question that a specific example and
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
then I'll yield the floor back we really
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
have um some struggles at times with the
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
lending industry for Farmers when we go
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
and advise them we say so capital is
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
like gasoline could burd your farm down
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
or can really help Propel it do you
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
really want to take this fixed debt on
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't see your return on that
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
debt we could run our own numbers and
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
say we don't see your debt repayment
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
capacity there it's a high risk
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
everything would need to go right and
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
they can make a more informed decision
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
than the lender saying oh no you can do
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
this this would be great for you so for
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
followup followup go ahead okay so that
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
that sounds great but are you doing that
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
today and if you are doing it today then
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
why are we spending another
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to do what you're already doing
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
because of the limited capacity that we
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
have in our organization today so John
 
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
Porter works one day every other week
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
and then Sarah Allen is our Dr Sarah
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
Allen is our Dairy specialist and she
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
works on all kinds of extra things I
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
brought her in for this one Farm to help
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
me because they were in my county and I
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
was working with them and the grant
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
review said give us specifics so she was
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
able to do that it it wasn't ubiquitous
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
across the state and sadly we are the
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
only Farm the this was the only Farm in
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
the state to actually apply for these
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
funds millions of dollars in Grant funds
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
being moved through Vermont via the USDA
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
and it was the only Farm in the state to
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
apply and we would like to see that be
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
upgraded thank you thank you
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
chair so so this position would be sort
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
of a Clearing House of for of resources
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
and leaz on to those resources so so
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
that they could be more broadly
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
used I think that's an apt description
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
we connect with our colleagues
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
nationally and regionally to have a
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
clearing house we also can create
 
01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:54.589 align:start position:0%
clearing house we also can create
resources

01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves um through research through
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know aggregating the information
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
like we did in the Benchmark study we
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
also would work one-on-one with Farms so
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
that they have you know the technical
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
assistance they need um and so all that
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
information followup go ahead thank you
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
um so so would this create like a
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
necessary redundancy or is it a is it a
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
does it provide new services and and
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
skills it would do both it would enhance
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
the ability for us to um serve more
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
farms and it would also create expertise
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
in areas we don't have so as as we have
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
contracted in Cooperative Extension our
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
ability to gain more subject matter
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge has been limited and so
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
there's so much technology happening so
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
quickly out there that if it was
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
someone's job in that sector that they
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
could really enhance and and take
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of those
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities representative viby yeah
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um an example of
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this position
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
would help uh in terms of bringing money
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
into the state is there is currently in
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
the USDA I think called the the reap
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
grants the rural energy something or
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
other program uh
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and uh that is that provides grant
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
funding for energy uh uh Alternative
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
Energy uh or like solar and wind Etc uh
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
for uh rural businesses including farms
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
and the definite it's a small rural
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
small businesses their definition of a
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
small business is $50 million or less uh
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
and if you're talking about a a a family
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
farm in New Hampshire competing against
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
a business that is you know even $25
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
million that New Hampshire Farm doesn't
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
have the um the the Personnel Resources
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
to figure out everything that needs to
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
be figured out for is this the is this
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
the right grant what and and you know I
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the list of things you need to
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
provide for the reap grants it's an
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
awful lot of paperwork and uh so so
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
sorting through that paperwork is
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
something that is you know you might
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
look at that paperwork and say oh God I
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
can't do that I have all these other
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
things I need to do so if there's
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
someone if there's a Cooperative
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
Extension specialist who can help uh the
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
farmer figure out what they need to do
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know what what they need to do in
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
order to get that paperwork that could
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
result in a grant for um you know 100
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
you know 100,000 to million dollars of
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
potential depending on on the scale
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's NE necessary of potential grant
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
funding for energy resources for the
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
farm and uh I looked at the list of who
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is getting those reap
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
grants a very small portion of it like
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
under 20% of the uh of New Hampshire uh
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that are getting reap grants
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
are farms it's mostly rural you know
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
other rural businesses uh and not that I
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
not that I have anything against other
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
rural businesses but I think that our
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
Farmers need to have a shot at these
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
grants they're there they will
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
definitely uh provide long-term better
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
sustainability for the farms uh and I
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean both both ecological and more
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
importantly I think uh economic
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability for the Farms so that is
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
why we need someone who uh we we really
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
need a specialist who at extension who
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
really has got the the technical knowhow
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
the energy knowhow to do that farm
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
advising for that specific Niche and I
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
think that you know um the broader you
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
what you discussed earlier in terms of
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know that example of uh the farm
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
that you helped get these resources for
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
that was part of your you know you were
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
wearing your business advisor hat on in
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is but the energy part is not
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
your specialty so someone who has that
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
energy part will that energy specialty
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
and that uh that farm engineering
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
specialty will be able to go into a farm
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
and see that infrastructure Energy
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
System and other infrastructure part of
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
it and be able to really look at it
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
holistically and make more targeted
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations and that's I I think
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
that would really help bring in that
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
grant funding that uh will make this you
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
know pay
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
multifold thank you representative
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um one of
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
the things that I'm wondering and this
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
is maybe um just a learning curve for me
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that when
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about schedule F does that
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
does a schedule F or is a schedule F
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
something that other like Coastal
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
communities may also fill out when it
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
comes to aquaculture or things so this
 
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
comes to aquaculture or things so this
is

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
the schedule is specifically for Farms
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
so if it's muscle farming is that it
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
could be it could yeah I I I it could be
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
aquaculture far if aquaculture Farms are
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
considered Farms so oh sorry so so it
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
could be uh I I believe that um I or
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
maybe could you might know more about
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
do many farms fill out the schedule F
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
Some Farms also have a Schedule C that
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
they fill out um for the specific
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
non-dairy production and this in this
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
case it looks like it's being used as a
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
tool only um to distinguish between
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
commercial farms and not commmercial
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
farms and so that I would probably add
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
Schedule C for the the value added the
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
processors um as well uh
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
but you also could just put a a mandate
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
that the Farms have to have whatever
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of gross income you
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
wanted depending on if you wanted to
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
distinguish from size but your choice oh
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
that's in
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
there uh representative k sorry thank
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
you recognize you there you go um I just
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
looked up the schedule F and uh just to
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of uh animal production
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
is beef cattle ranching and farming
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
cattle feed Lots dairy cattle and milk
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
production hog and pig farming poultry
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
and egg production sheep and goat
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
farming aquaculture and other animal
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
production and that was just under
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
Productions there other uh items listed
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
such as Crop Production forestry and
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
logging are also part of schedule
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
F okay representative
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
Penza so representative Bixby would you
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
be okay with adding and if it needed to
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
have some criteria on there the schedule
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
C um I think okay so uh I just need a
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
little clarification is Schedule C only
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
value added production and that's
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
separated from so would that be uh so
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
um the North Country Smokehouse would
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
they uh they would have a schedule C but
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
not a schedule F is that right I don't
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
claim to be a tax F expert but I do
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's correct all non um all
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
the um retail Farm stands Schedule C
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
labor and and whatnot and so the milk
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
processing plants Schedule C so we have
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
um home B bottlers there so that would
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
be I don't know Rob Johnson do you have
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
Johnson we've had this issue before and
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that only sole
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
proprietor proprietorships are required
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
to file a Schedule F other a partner
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
ship Corporation does not need to we
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
again this this type of language has
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
been proposed in the past and we have
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
always opposed it because you are
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
cutting out a segment for
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility so we would add Schedule C
 
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.510 align:start position:0%
eligibility so we would add Schedule C
to

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
this I don't know enough to if that does
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
it I just know that not all Farms file a
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
Schedule F okay yeah good to know I stay
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
there for a sec because I wanted to kind
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
of I wanted to kind of get your your uh
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
your feedback about this um amendment to
 
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.110 align:start position:0%
your feedback about this um amendment to
this

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill I really I've just had the
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
discussion and the schedule left was one
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
the issue that jumped out to me okay
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
research that representative Bixby so
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
the the point of having the schedule
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
left there is that we wanted so you know
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
I have I have a homestead Garden
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
operation that that we basically just
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
feed ourselves with I don't think I
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
should be eligible for this spe for
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
working with this special
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh I you know I think that um like um
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
but I I I want it to be Farms that are
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
actually in the business of farming as
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh the broader definition
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we have in um in uh RSA 21 I I
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
understand why you want it there and I I
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
think we agree with that philosophy but
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you that not all Farms
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
that are eligible that our Farms would
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
be uh able to apply the language is
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
there a way that we could make that
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
distinction without excluding those for
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
there may be we'd have to do some
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
research I I just know there's been
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past that has
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
proposed a schedule F piece in my tenure
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
two three four five times I've I've come
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
across this where I've had to explain
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
that it it it it just doesn't you're
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
you're limiting a segment of the ad
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
Community legitimate F represent
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair and I think
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion so a schedule F
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
is when you file a form 1040 if you are
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
a partnership or a corporation or a C
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
Corp sorp whatever you're either filing
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
a form 1065 or
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
1120 they're not the
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
forms representative
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair I was
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if this
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
would we're clearly not going to get to
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
a solid answer but I think we need to
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
seek out some other re revisit some
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
other areas so is that possible that we
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
can uh representative Bixby are you open
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
to to circling back with LBA and some
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
other yeah um yeah I'd be open to um to
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
seeing if we can find a another way to
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
narrow it um that doesn't use the
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
schedule F
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh um Mr
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
Wimer what we did with the farm Mental
 
01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:23.910 align:start position:0%
Wimer what we did with the farm Mental
Health

01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
$200,000 was allocated in the binal
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget and so as we narrow down that
 
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
program you have to be a farm owner and
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have we took the phraseology
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
from the tax code that said you had to
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
have some liability you have to um we
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
could get the exact language but it said
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
effectively you had to be a business
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
with with liability in there so we have
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
that language that we used for the
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
farmer mental health bill that and we
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
also made it that you had to be a farm
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
owner owner because we had limited um
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
funds we couldn't serve everybody in the
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
F mental health so that language is
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
easily had I don't know it off the top
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
of my head sadly but I know where to
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
find it in a heartbeat well if you could
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
send that to me then I can put it into
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment thank you absolutely
 
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.990 align:start position:0%
an amendment thank you absolutely
representa

01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah I'm looking at uh the last
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
five years of the uh reap program and
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if maybe we're being
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
too granular on this uh because I'm not
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
sure that that representative Bixby
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
would you know want to fill out all of
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
the paperwork for a $3,000 or a $4,000
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
Grant you know I mean I'm looking these
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
grants are are pretty small so I mean I
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
think if we have some
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
generic um language in the bill that
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know some people may fall
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
through the cracks and they you know
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
they may want to spend you know a half a
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
year of their life you know to get one
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
of these grants but you know I'm not
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
sure that's it's really that big of an
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
issue pres fixby okay so and this is not
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
solely about reap grants and the reap
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
grants have been uh the the funding that
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
came through the inflation reduction act
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
for repr Grants has bumped up the amount
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
significantly so um so the so the
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
average might might not be that you know
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
the the I i' I'd have to look up the
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
amounts again but um but I I know that
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
that there is um there is more available
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh under that program there is ALS there
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
are also a number of other grants out
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
there that I couldn't name off the top
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
of my head that could be relevant in
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
this situation it's not just about the
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
reef grants it's about uh other grants
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
that would be available for Farm energy
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
farm in infrastructure and that's
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
something that we would want a field
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
specialist to be knowledgeable about uh
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly more knowledgeable than I
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby I um was
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about this um line 15 and 16 on
 
01:21:03.239 --> 01:21:04.110 align:start position:0%
thinking about this um line 15 and 16 on
page

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
one and I wonder if we can say something
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
to the effect that
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
um definition of for the purpose of this
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
subdivision Farm means a farming
 
01:21:17.719 --> 01:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
subdivision Farm means a farming
operation

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um that is farming for profit and
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
reports to the IRS would that kind of
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
cover all bases or it may but I think
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
that um Mr Wilmer had uh made reference
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
to a uh some language that's in the in
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
the uh Farm mental health bill that
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
exists that does the job that might do
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
the the the job that we want so I'd like
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
to see and he's going to get that
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
language to me so um when I get that
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
language I can distribute it to the okay
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
Penza so just so I understand in regards
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
with the the funding the $100,000 so it
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's underneath the New Hampshire
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
food but then they're Contracting out to
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
you guys for that position is that how
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
it works M yeah correct that would be
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
how that works follow up yeah sure so I
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
know that representative big is going to
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
go back on this but to me you know I
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
know we're going to add maybe in there
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
initially 100,000 and um but there's no
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's no language in here if
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
this let's say this is successful you
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
know no three year no five year there's
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
nothing so this possibly could be a
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
oneandone so if that happens and it
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't get into a budget for next time
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
what does that mean we would have to go
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
back to this drawing board again
 
01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
back to this drawing board again
represent

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
com thank you madam chair I believe that
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of understanding has to
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
be reviewed and updated every 3 years or
 
01:23:06.669 --> 01:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
less as may be necessary if you look at
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.679 --> 01:23:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah I would also uh make people
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
aware that in our 10 counties uh each of
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
the counties uh does add funding in
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
their budget for UNH extension okay and
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
so in Hillsboro County for example which
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
I would assume is the least rural County
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh I mean if you divide $100,000 up by
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
10 counties we're talking $10,000 each
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
and if we found that this program was a
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
benefit to our farmers in Hillsboro
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
County uh I don't think it would be a
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
big issue in the county to add an
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
additional 10,000 000 to the money we
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
all already give to UNH extension
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
because we're providing a direct
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
economic benefit to our Farmers um and I
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
think in all of the counties we really
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the farmers and want to
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
assist them in anyway so that could be
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
although we certainly would want the
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
state to you know uh support this
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
program I really do think that each of
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
the counties uh would recognize the
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
benefit representative
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to uh
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
reinforce representative Duty's point
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
you know I mean ideally yes this goes
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
into kind of the next budget as a
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
request from the Department uh but even
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
if I hate to put it in these terms the
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario it's just the
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
one-year funding to to begin with I
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
think that when we see the results right
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
then I think that that is going to be
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
the best argument for uh more
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
contributions from counties uh and more
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
contribution uh from the state so I
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
think that the results over the course
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
of that one year will be a really good
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
argument for more investment
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative BBY okay so um I
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the support on that but I
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
think that in ter I sit on the advisory
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
Council for uh the extension in in
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
straford County uh and in terms of the
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
way that the budgeting works for uh the
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
County extension and for um the
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
extension that's based at at UNH uh that
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
the the idea of having the counties chip
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
in individually for this particular
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
position just really wouldn't work with
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
the way that it's being set up uh the so
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
the uh Cooperative Extension has done a
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
great deal of work in terms of figuring
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
out how to balance their resources in
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the counties and what gets paid for by
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
the counties and what what's home what
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
has a home at un and what gets paid for
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
through the uh the state the chunk of
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
the state budget that goes to UNH and
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
then gets you know some of that get
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
split off for the extension and also
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
what the what extension does through
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
memorandum uh memoranda of of
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
understanding which is the way they pay
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
for pay for Foresters uh
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think that this is that um the
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
we essentially this need I need to I do
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
need to write to make an amend amend
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
this in order to make sure that it's
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a um a multi-year
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
program uh and that the it needs to be
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated each um the the sufficient
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation needs to be made uh from
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
um to the department to cover it every
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
year but uh I don't think that asking
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
the count ities to to chip in is is
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to is a is a workable solution for
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
it um but um and did I get that right do
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't they chip in for uh for the
 
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't the the county budget if I'm
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
correct gives
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
25% of all the extension Educators
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
salaries yeah and on the county basis
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
not for the program managers not for any
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
admin ative support and so it does not
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
cover any of the Statewide um people so
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
our Campus based Specialists have to
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
bring in 25% of their own salary with
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
grants and they um and this is a hybrid
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
though this is not a state specialist
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
nor is this a county based specialist it
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide field specialist okay so
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't be funded by county
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't have the the grant
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
obligation to it um I also would ask
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
also allow you not allow you um bring to
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
your awareness sorry Chris Callahan from
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
the University of Vermont um is a
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
similar out to the same position so you
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
could look at all the engineering you
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
could look at all the energy
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
efficiencies you could look at all the
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
other um ways that he has brought
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
technology to farms in Vermont that has
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you any other questions or
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
comments regarding this um Amendment one
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
more um one more represent Dy this is
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
just a comment in general just because
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
it isn't doesn't mean it can't
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
be I mean I think a little vision going
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
forward if we think it's an important
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
program just because we don't have a
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism to fund it now doesn't mean we
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't create a mechanism to fund it now
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
if we feel that it is a viable program
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
program that assists our economy and
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
assists our and assists our Farmers just
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
want to make that comment thank you
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thanks Madam
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
chair and I I I do say that uh I hear
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative dsy and I think that
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
might be a larger conversation for an
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
association of counties or some other
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
conversation because it's not just one
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
County that would have to have that
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
conversation thank
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
else all right so um I guess um
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you've got some
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
homework and
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully you can get your assignment
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
done before next
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday thank you very much thank
 
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.030 align:start position:0%
Tuesday thank you very much thank
you

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
Road all right moving right along thank
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Winer and uh and also uh Mr
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
Johnson for your input on
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
this the last bill that we're going to
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
discuss this afternoon is I mean this
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
morning is 8 HB 602 relative to landfill
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
sighting and I believe that
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins and
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative Penza would like to say a
 
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
representative Penza would like to say a
few

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
few
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
words representative H Haskins I defer
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
to my colleague to start us off all
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
right representative Penza you have the
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
floor oh the ball's in my court oh there
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
you go all right so um I had all this
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
other all this other stuff that I'm
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
going to say probably within questions
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff but um this bill basically is
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know original 602 puts the cart
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
before the horse in a sense because we
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
have rules that are uh at this point um
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
underway so this actually this bill puts
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
the horse first and we are which is
 
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
mind-boggling to me as more I learn
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
we're you know one of the only States
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
right now that doesn't have a
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
preliminary application this is this is
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
good for all involved it's good for of
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
course the state but it's it's just as
 
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
good for the industry um to be able to
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
have criteria in place that which is
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
also you know automatically um a
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
non-starter for putting a landfill in so
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
um you know just in some preliminary
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
looks for example you know Massachusetts
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
which is actually not permitting any new
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
landfills at all they have a three-phase
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
process um Vermont who's not permitting
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
new landfills you know they have a very
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
extensive one phase but there won't be
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
another landfill probably in Vermont
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
Maine has a two-step process
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania has a a two-phase process
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
Oregon South Carolina Maryland and I can
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
go on so um this basically you know it
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
reviews the site you know suitability um
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
report and it determines like whether a
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
parcel meets criteria for uses of
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
landfill that is really um the gist of
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
this bill it really is the exact same
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
bill as before it's just with you know
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
like kind of every instance where we had
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
you know Dees um saying that it was
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
shall uh it's now actually giving Dees
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
um their own ideas to come up with it of
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether you know to designate you know a
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire site uh a poor location
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
for new landfills um you know I have a a
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
whole slle of reasonings in here that
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
just make sense um but for example like
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
environmental impact assessment you know
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
right now you have um you can have a the
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
industry will come in and they will
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
spend tens of thousands of dollars uh
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know working the land
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and they would lose all of that money
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
how how we have it set up and this
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary application process you know
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it also includes you know public input
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
especially for a location and stuff like
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
that local residents stakeholders um to
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
get all of that information in place but
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
if if the ground is it just doesn't make
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
sense for it to be there and Das already
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
knows those criteria you're going to
 
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
save so much resources not just for the
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
industry side of things they'll save
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
money but also for Dees in general and
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
we all know that um Dees is very much
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
strapped for time just like we all are
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
and their resources are slim um they've
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
just lost their um their second in
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
command and so yeah so this this piece
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
could really help them the only thing
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
that's missing in this amendment that
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
OLS they might have just missed it is a
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
it would be at the
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
end and it would
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
say basically recognizing that there's
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
additional work Dees um must put put
 
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
into this rul making um the July 2024
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
deadline to revise EnV sw800 is extended
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
for one year until July 2025 this is not
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
saying that they they can't have it done
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
in time but if they're going to have um
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
this preliminary application piece which
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
just makes sense and mirrors so many
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
other states then they can have you know
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
an an extra you know an extra year to be
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
able to put it in representative Bixby
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
yeah actually to that point I just
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
noticed um on page two line one uh not
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
withstanding RSA 541a administrative
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
rule uh envs w800 shall remain in effect
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
until July 21 July 1 2025 or until re
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
reopt rules are effective that's
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
basically the way that uh OS translated
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
that what you were looking
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
for so that so basically uh that that's
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's what delays the the due date of
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
the rules okay perfect thank you so you
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to amend it okay it's good as
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
kraton okay so I agree with everything
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying I just I'm confused which
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
probably the standard State of Affairs
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we just went through a whole thing
 
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.070 align:start position:0%
uh so we just went through a whole thing
about

01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh the the rules and defining and we
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
said no you don't need $200,000 you
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
don't need another person you don't need
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
to do a contract just go ahead and write
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
the rules and so then we established a
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that said oh by the way go
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
ahead and establish the rules and we're
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
going to check your homework which is
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
fine that's our job and and and that's
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
good but now what we're saying is go
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and write the rules we're going to
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
check our homework and oh by the way
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
next June when this passes we're going
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
to change everything we told you to do
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
in the first place and so that's that's
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
the way I'm reading this so let me just
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
offer and if I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the first time but it would
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
seem to me that this would be something
 
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
we would tell them to write this into
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
the rules hey you guys are doing the
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
rules you're reviewing it put this into
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
the rules as you're writing them and
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need a separate law to change
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
the table after they've already written
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
so I I guess that's my question that I'm
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
baffled represent
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
Penza oh representative H Haskins thank
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
you madam chair actually what we're
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that we believe
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
strongly that in order to get the
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
integrity and transparency in the
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
process we need this phase one
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
permitting because that will St save
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
time and money by Dees if they can show
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
that certain sites are clearly
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
landfill representative
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
kraton fair enough I and I agree with
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that my point is though that then that
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
will have to be put into rules no and so
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
why don't we just tell them to put that
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
into the rules as they're writing them
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
now to say hey put this in there and and
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
and then we can monitor that through the
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee process and then you don't
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
go through another year worth of debate
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
and you don't go through a whole you
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
know I mean they're not going to get
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
this until June or July the earliest
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
over representative
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
ger uh thank you uh I want to say that
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
um I along with a number of other
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
legislators uh on both sides of the
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
aisle including representative Penza we
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
met with Dees in August to talk about uh
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have happened
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
and our as aspirations for you know how
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
things were going to go forward and one
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that we talked about was
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
was the relationship with Dees and the
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and the need to have on the
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
one hand appropriately explicit guidance
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
provided by the legislature and
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
discretion for Dees to be able to figure
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
out how to make it work right and and I
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
think that this amendment does that very
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
very well it does not prescribe any
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
content at all right so we're not
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
telling them what rules they have to
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
write or how they have to write them
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
unlike the original 602 so there's lots
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
of latitude and discretion for Dees but
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
it also provides them with guidance in
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
terms of the process uh and and so I
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
would say that we are telling Dees as
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're working on rules and giving them
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time if they need to
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
incorporate this into rules that this is
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
the structure of the process right that
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
is going to say Dees time it's going to
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
take save time for applicants it is
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
going to result in a better process but
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing that
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
without telling
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
Dees how to do their jobs in terms of
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
what the content of the rule writing is
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to be so based on those
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
conversations and as I said really
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
good conversations and work done on a
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
very bipartisan basis and obviously this
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is offered by our colleagues
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle I think this
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
strikes that really nice balance between
 
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
strikes that really nice balance between
guidance

01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
and discretion for
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
Dees represent Bixby yeah so I think
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
that uh one thing to remember is that
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
the rules that Dees is currently working
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
on are for essentially they're updating
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
the existing rules uh in terms of how
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
the perating process works and what this
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
amendment what this bill will do uh this
 
01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159 align:start position:0%
amended bill will do is create a
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
different a second layer of Permitting
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
so what this so this is not actually
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to interrupt any of the stuff that
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Dees is already doing for their uh July
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
2024 deadline what it's going to do is
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
add another piece of the process that
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have yet and
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with what rep germano was
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
saying uh what this Amendment does is it
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
provides direction from us without
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
being um
 
01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.589 align:start position:0%
being um
micromanaging

01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
micromanaging
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we could not we could not in fact
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
go to Dees informally and say could you
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
put this in because they don't have the
 
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
power to do that what gives them a power
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
to do that is when we pass a bill like
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
this so uh so in order for for Dees to
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
create a pre permitting process they
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
need to have the legislative authority
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
that or authorization to do
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
that um be before we get to anybody
 
01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.390 align:start position:0%
that um be before we get to anybody
else's

01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
else's
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions the only concern I have about
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
this is that even though this touches
 
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 149 DM
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
col9 we are setting up a new preliminary
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
permit application process and my
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
concern is the germanness of this
 
01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.669 align:start position:0%
concern is the germanness of this
language

01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
that it would it would appear that we
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
would need um some sort of new public
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
hearing to have various uh people weigh
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
in on setting up a a preliminary permit
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
application which is a process we don't
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
um can you reply to that or comment on
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
Penza so I've spoke
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
with uh the I spoke with the clerk
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
specifically about this and at first
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
look which is almost exact to um what I
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
submitted he said that it was Germain
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I was okay with this so and he was
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay with it I can send this back to him
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
again the the only thing that's
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
different in this is basically saying
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
cuz all the rules we're not we're not
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be something that they're
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to put into rules all the rules
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they're currently in the process of
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
doing are getting done this is basically
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
saying okay well when an application
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
comes in all those rules that you've
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
just spent all that time on if you know
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they're going to put it you know
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
right next right in sandy soil right
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
next to a body of surface water problem
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be next to a private
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
well whatever I mean so that it would
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
automatically be something that's
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
discarded based upon the rules that are
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
written we don't have that and which is
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
crazy that we don't because it's it's
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's almost a given in every other state
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
so that one piece um that process piece
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
is is really instead of us telling them
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
because we're not telling them what
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it's basically what
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're telling us and I don't know I
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if we would need another
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
um um public hearing for this I think it
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
still Falls all under the same but um I
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
can check if you'd like me to
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent Howard thank you madam
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
chair um it seems to me that that we are
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
doing them the favor of um providing an
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
an efficiency to the process because um
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
if you as you just said um if you apply
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
the rules early in the process you can
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're eliminating spending more
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
money either as as the as a proponent or
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
as the agency um pursuing something that
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
that under the rules would not
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
proceed representative H Haskins thank
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair it's also true that the
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
Senate hasn't seen 602 yet so of course
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is time for a public hearing at
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
that juncture but I think that the
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
had all those prescriptions and so what
 
01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
we've done is shortened that up and
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
said that could be said to be a a first
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
stage permit process but we've said okay
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
let's call it a stage one permit process
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
instead of all the fine lines about that
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
was in the bill originally we've
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
shortened that up but it was in effect a
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
permit process by having all those
 
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.669 align:start position:0%
permit process by having all those
condition

01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
itions so that much hasn't really
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
changed we're just shortening it calling
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
it what it is and then giving Dees the
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
discretion that they need to do the ru
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
making represent Bixby yeah so um first
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
of all I think this bill makes an awful
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
lot of sense um and based on uh What uh
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Penza reported in terms
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
of her her conversation with Paul with
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh clerk Smith
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
I think that um that it sounds very much
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
like uh he has deemed this to be Germain
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh it might be worth having just a a
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
second followup with the now that it's
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
been fully drafted but um but I think
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
that uh we could probably be fairly
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
confident that uh however much it
 
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
changed in drafting is not going to make
 
01:45:48.189 --> 01:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
a difference and we can uh if it turns
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
out that it is in fact not
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
um would we have time before our
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
deadline to for retained bills to have a
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative German thank you
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just want to very briefly
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
reinforce uh the point that was made
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
well by representative H Haskins right
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
that in 602 previously there was a whole
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
set of criteria right that we said that
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
people had to meet uh in this case um
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
it it gives again that discretion piece
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
to Dees it says that they'll adopt one
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
or more prohibitive locational criteria
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
right so that instead of that long
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptive list it's up to Dees and it
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
could be a much simpler set of criteria
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
which will expedite that process for
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
Dees as well as
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
applicants representative
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair I did have
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
one other question I guess regarding um
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
which page one subsection three so
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's lines 22 through
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
24 um one of the so it seems to me that
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
that piece of language is really
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
considering what I think we have been
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussing for some time is what what I
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
would say are potentially cumulative
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
impacts um and I was just curious it
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
mentions directly um greenhouse gas
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
admissions as a Baseline and I just
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we have that
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
information or that data somewhere to be
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
able to say that we are making that
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
um we're asking for that
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
information can yep representative
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
Penza so this is basically it's it's
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's giving a list of what Dees might
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
consider so this
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
isn't they might not consider that we
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
just put a whole series of these things
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
in here that while they're in the
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
process of making their their rules most
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
likely they are considering all of these
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
things so this isn't um this isn't us
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
telling them anything we're you know of
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
course you know needless greenhouse gas
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
emissions Highway congestion traffic
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
congestion traffic accidents or other
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
negative impacts we're just putting we
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
just basically put a little bit of a
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
laundry list of the things that they're
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
already considering so for example if
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
the rules come back and they have that
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know for example that line line
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
three is mentioned in there and someone
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
an application well it's and it's going
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
to have a huge issue let's say if it's
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
right up north you know um oneway
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
Highway type of thing that you know with
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
massive trucks and heavy equipment and
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
all would create a huge burden for an
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
area then of course if that's what Dees
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
has already put in there in their rul
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
making then that would restrict an
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
application automatically so this isn't
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
asking them to to do anything we just
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
put a whole series of different criteria
 
01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
put a whole series of different criteria
that's

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:52.149 align:start position:0%
that's
it

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh yes thank you
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair um we recently in nashwa had
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
a public hearing uh with
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
Dees uh regarding an ashalt plant um we
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
had all of the key players from Dees
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
there uh and they called this meeting
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
basically um as a nod to EP EPA that um
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
is encouraging um
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services organizations to
 
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
have more public input so um this was a
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
way of them coming to nashwa and
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
educating uh the residents and
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
interested individuals on what Dees
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
requires for permitting and this was the
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
air resources um department and one of
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh previous um Deputy
 
01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:49.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioner was there and was very
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
clear and we clarified it with him
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
several times okay that in the
 
01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
permitting process they can only take
 
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.589 align:start position:0%
permitting process they can only take
into

01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
consideration um technical
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
information okay related to the permit
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
so if you have so in other words for the
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
ashalt plant um as long as the permit as
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
long as the plant meets the technical
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that the public can have no
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
other input into the process
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the fact that 50 trucks a day
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
might be going past there you know that
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
they might be idling at 6:00 a.m. in the
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
morning and spewing out diesel fuel none
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
of that can be considered and when we
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
clarified that there were two tracks um
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
the technical track only that would be
 
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
considered and then what the
 
01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
neighborhood might be uh um concerned
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
about he verified that they only take
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
into consideration technical
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
and so when we talked about the
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts he's um rep uh
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
commission Deputy Commissioner sandborne
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
said that currently is not in statute
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore we cannot take that into
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
consideration so I just want to be clear
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
that we are putting that into statute
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
now if this gets passed and that's
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
what's of concern you know to our our
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
residents people walked out of there and
 
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
said then why should we even show up for
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
a public hearing because I can I can
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
tell you there there's probably only one
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
or two people in nashwa who have the
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
technical expertise to look at a permit
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
and question it the vast majority of
 
01:51:42.069 --> 01:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
people you know they don't want to smell
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
they don't want to hear they don't want
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
to poison their kids but Dees cannot
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration right now
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
so so I mean I think this is this these
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
lines 22 to 24 are really
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
critical representative
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
Howard are we by by including these
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
things in here are we assuming that
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're in the rules and and um and
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
we've differentiated before between
 
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
statutes and and rules so um I'm just
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if if we're putting things in
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
here that can't that if they don't make
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
it into the rules they're irrelevant
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.229 align:start position:0%
it into the rules they're irrelevant
right

01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
Penza we would assume that these are the
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
things that are considered as you know
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
our rules are like slimmed to none right
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
now so we're we're we're hoping and
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
through meetings and I was at those
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
meetings as well um they have said that
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
they they would like instruction so this
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
is just in a sense some instruction yes
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
guidance but it of course you know this
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
this could be 10 pages long if we were
 
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to go based upon all of the
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
different criteria so this was just here
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
as as you know I want to say kind of
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
like a placeholder but these are the
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that you would consider right
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
that in a sense if the these these
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
criteria weren't met that it would be an
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
automatic denial for an application and
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
then you don't have you know a company
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
that has spent you know tens of
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars already doing
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
sighting um of course the well work all
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff that has to be
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
done which is very expensive so it just
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have that these are
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
certain things that are they're just
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the criteria that we're familiar
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
with just from what the research has
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
been done representative
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair did um when
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
you talked to Dees what was their
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
response to this was
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
there to this bill yeah to this bill I
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
have I have not spoken with Dees in
 
01:53:55.709 --> 01:53:55.719 align:start position:0%
regards with this okay we had um you
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
know there were meetings the summer and
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but that weren't
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
specifically for that I mean we knew we
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
weren't going to put be putting in any
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
new you know
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
um HB 56 type bills or HB you know this
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is is really in place to
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
give you know Dees The Authority that
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
they want and also the public input the
 
01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
beauty of this is is that there's before
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
something gets rubber stamped that that
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
the community is going to have input
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be public input which
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
is great on all sides and I and I think
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's what's so important um
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
so okay but we so we don't I'm sorry so
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what Dees de hadn't seen
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
this they have not seen it I'm gonna say
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to over the wall and we
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
hope it doesn't go off okay
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative Duty I would just say
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
that in in talking to D Dees on a number
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
of things normally they don't take a
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
position you know they just normally
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't take a position yeah
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
so represent ger uh thank you and I I
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
want to point out two things Madam chair
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh number one again just to emphasize
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
the importance also on uh in terms of of
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
the applicants right and and clarifying
 
01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
A process for the applicants in this
 
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
case the importance of line 11 uh which
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
is that or 10 and 11 an application that
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
does not pass such a preliminary screen
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
shall be returned to the applicant
 
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
without prejudice right so I think
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
that's also an important piece of this
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill that it is also to the benefit of
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
the applicant they get that feedback if
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
if if it's an immediate no with the
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity then to to to to to resubmit
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and also uh I think that again
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
based on conversations previously with
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
Dees I think that this strikes the
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
balance that they have repeatedly asked
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
for between guidance and disc
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
discression representative Murray uh
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I just want to
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
also ask I guess ask the question
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
because in in previous testimony that we
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
have received from the Department around
 
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
this topic um there have been um
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
instances which the department has said
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
to an applicant for various reasons and
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
parts of their applications that things
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
had to go back so I'm
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
curious um well I understand that uh the
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
department may not take a position that
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
that um they don't follow the potential
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
language or they don't those kinds of
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
things so I would be interested to this
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like something entirely
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh new in that sense that there the
 
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
preliminary portion yes new but there
 
01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
have been times in which from my
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
understanding um applications have
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
been po or portions of the application
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
have been re-referred back to the
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:51.790 align:start position:0%
have been re-referred back to the
applicant

01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair I want to Second what my
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
colleague um representative Duty said
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
she said it better than I um Dees is
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
looking to us for guidance we are giving
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
them the guidance and I think all that's
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
been said about the bill you know we
 
01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
still have time if we need to to get
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
further input uh um but we are giving
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
Dees the job that they're paid to do
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they're there to do and our job is
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
to tell them what we
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
want thank you representative
 
01:57:38.189 --> 01:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
Penza so I just wanted to reiterate um
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
the point that representative ger made
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
which is is great without prejudice so
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I also I just I think I want to um
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
just speak to what you said Megan it
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
from what I'm from what I know basically
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
the applications have only come back
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
because they were incomplete not not in
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
this state that they basically were okay
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
well there's a criteria that's met so um
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that's really kind of a a whole
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
different situation so um not about it
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
has never has anything to do with
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
picking the wrong site and and usually
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
at that point when an application has
 
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
been put in there's also been there's
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
been you know money spent at that Point
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative anyone
 
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
else any other questions or comments
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
regarding this
 
01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.669 align:start position:0%
regarding this
amendment

01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
um Okay I uh I am just interested to
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that um we
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh that this that this amendment is
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
germine um I I don't want to be setting
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
up um you know a new
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
process uh and we I don't really believe
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
we have enough time to do any kind of
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it um so with that in
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
mind um I I do hope that you will take
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the um Amendment as it's been
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
drafted to um the the house Clerk and
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps even to the speaker for um a
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
ruling on whether it's Germaine or not
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah after this I can walk over if um
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
if clerk um Smith is there I will hand
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
it to him and I'll get you guys
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
