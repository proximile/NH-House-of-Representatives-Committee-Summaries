00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
on all five of these bills
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
the policy has been determined
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
we are only going to deal with the
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
revenue part of these bills anything
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
that has to do with revenues or
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
keep reminding yourself of that
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
we can't change the policy
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
we may not like it we may like it
 
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
we may not like it we may like it
but

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
our job is to look at the revenue part
 
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
two members from commerce committee
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%

of the marijuana bill
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
so because they talk about a
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
to have two people from finance to come
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
in and sit on the public hearing
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%

of that bill
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
they can help us with the questions and
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
the things that we need to
 
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
the things that we need to
address

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
in order to know what to do
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
what action to take on the bill
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that will be just for those two bills
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
speaker has approved it
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
they will not be voting members
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
but there will be
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for that date
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
to ask questions
 
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
to ask questions
representative

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to congratulate you on putting
 
00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
i'd like to congratulate you on putting
the

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
economic update session next friday
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
instead of this friday
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
an issue of hope that
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i think
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
the reason we're inviting finance is
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
that there's a 24 million dollar ask in
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
for funds to
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
see getting the stores open and all that
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's unbudgeted so
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
that's why finance is going to be
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
involved with the marijuana bill
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
and it's only going to go to one
 
00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
and it's only going to go to one
committee

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we're at and then we're inviting
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
these others thank you
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we get
 
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we get
started

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
then we have four bills to go through
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
we'll start off numerically
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
with house bill
 
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
with house bill

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
feels that this bill is very important
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and would like another seven to ten
 
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
um and would like another seven to ten
days

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
which i know is gonna make it tight
 
00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
which i know is gonna make it tight
um

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
and uh he
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
really would like um
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
to come with some language you know in
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
in the next seven to ten days so
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a way for us to
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
fit that in or not
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
if you would get back to him and say
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're out of time okay so we would need
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
it back by
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
is that
to

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
do it next week
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
it has to
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
be in the calendar
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the shut off for the date for the
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
calendar was yesterday right
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be stretched to the
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of the following week
 
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.829 align:start position:0%
beginning of the following week
so

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
we won't have another chance at it
 
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.949 align:start position:0%
we won't have another chance at it
so

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
that brings up
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
so we would have to vote these final
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
four bills out then on the on possibly
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
the tuesday of that but that's but
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't these bills have to be in the
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
calendar for the
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
for the uh
session

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
so we gotta we gotta we got a math
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can um
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have to execute these four bills you
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
we have to execute these four bills you
know

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
we just pick up no no because the
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
calendars published on the thursday
 
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.710 align:start position:0%
calendars published on the thursday
before

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
tuesday the 9th
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
for wednesday the 16th and thursday the
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
17th it's the 10th though he's moved the
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
session back another week without
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
changing the deadline formal deadline
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
but he's moved it
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
a week earlier without carries my
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
impression was the speaker was planning
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
to have sessions on two consecutive
 
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
to have sessions on two consecutive
weeks

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
it is uh right now the calendar uh for
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
sessions is set at the 10th
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
the 17th possibly the 16th if there's
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the number of bills that would take up
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that much time and then again the 31st
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the session calendar
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
the tenth
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
is the last time
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have to report the bill out
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
we have one bite of the apple to be able
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the tenth is the following week
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
after next week
 
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
after next week
so

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
so it's alarm confuses we have a session
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
on the 10th
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that all the bills
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that are not in second committee bills
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
in the calendar it says last day to
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
report house bills not in a second
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
committee which were these four bills
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
so we could still vote those out by the
 
00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
so we could still vote those out by the
10th

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
it may not be in the calendar for the
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
vote on the floor
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
because there's another date coming up
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
after that correct am i not missing
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
so okay so we're not as much problem as
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
by the 10th you know then it'll be on
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
the calendar for the next right
 
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
the calendar for the next right
session

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
and we don't have much
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
of an opportunity we have a couple days
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
but that's it
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
so then
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's it for today on 10
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
97. well mister you get a hold of yeah
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
well so i have a question are we going
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
dead date so should it be
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
tuesday the 8th i mean it depends when

we're meeting we'd have to meet um on
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.670 align:start position:0%
right
but

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
we give attorney garland a date by next
 
00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
we give attorney garland a date by next
week

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the dra would still need time to put in
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
our input and um
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
and the date for next week is it closer
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
to the 10th so i just want to make sure
 
00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
to the 10th so i just want to make sure
that

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee is aware of uh
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
that we need to put in our input as well
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen the language from from
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
so we may end up
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
putting this into internal study and the
 
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.550 align:start position:0%

very concerned about how dra felt about
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
it and wanted to make sure that any

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
representative ames
uh

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
i guess in light of this discussion and
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
also our previous discussions about this
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill about the issue that's trying to
 
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.390 align:start position:0%
bill about the issue that's trying to
address

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's complicated um that's why uh we're
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
not getting an immediate response from
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
the ag's office it's complicated
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's something that you want don't want
 
00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
it's something that you want don't want
to

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
do quickly if you don't have to and so
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't really see an urgency to
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
this issue so that uh
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
when we get to it and we can go through
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
this process for sure
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
i certainly lean towards an interim
 
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
i certainly lean towards an interim
study

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
on a subject like this
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
i'm actually quite surprised that
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
the ag's office and dra hasn't had this
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
in their radar and thought about this
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
already i mean you would think that
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
with this issue that they would have at
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
least given it some thought in the past
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
year or so
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm kind of
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
surprised that they would need more time
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
but that's just a comment thank you
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
any further cars i got a comment thank
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
is possibly i mean maybe the middle step
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
is if we run out of
 
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.270 align:start position:0%
is if we run out of
runway

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
runway
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
try to get by the date
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
um is there any way we might be able to
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
attack a bill that's been fully vetted
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
onto a senate bill that we may get
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it could be possible but i
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is more of a standalone
 
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
i think this is more of a standalone
bill

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
what mr wang and mr garland comes up
 
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
what mr wang and mr garland comes up
with

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.549 align:start position:0%
with
with

00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative tunisian and
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
if there's nothing else then we'll go on
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
um i have to step out for a couple
 
00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.029 align:start position:0%
um i have to step out for a couple
minutes

00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
romney will
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
open up the work session on house bill
 
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
open up the work session on house bill
1221.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
12 21 is uh has to do with the the rates
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
on the business profits tax and the
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i think um
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative janae again
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
has in a moment
 
00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
has in a moment
sorry

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
sorry
yes

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment is um
 
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
the amendment is um
2022-0471

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
2022-0471
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
h which i passed out at our last work
 
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
h which i passed out at our last work
session

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
hopefully everyone
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
has access to that but it's very simple
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't basically the amendment
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
removes the reduction to the bet
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
tax and so
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
reduction so basically we're only
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a reduction of the business
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
profits tax from 7.6 to 7.5 percent
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh again according to the fiscal note
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
the lowering of the bet and that um
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
can i just ask if um i don't know if one
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the ques i think one of the things
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the last work session was that dra
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
would um would bring you know if only
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
the bpt is being lowered the fiscal
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
impact of that i think i think that's
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
what we had
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
all right we were we were going to get
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.230 align:start position:0%
all right we were we were going to get
some

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm devin
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
roderick senior financial aides
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
we did respond to the um to the fiscal
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
note request for that
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the impact of only lowering the bpt
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
tax rate would result in that first
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
chart in our original fiscal note
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
it's a 1.8 million
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
dollar reduction in revenue in fiscal
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
year 23.
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
followed by a 7.2 million reduction
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the 8.4 million and 25 fiscal year
 
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.870 align:start position:0%
in the 8.4 million and 25 fiscal year
25.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
there was a few charts in the very end
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
of that fiscal note
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
it would be the
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's the second chart
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
in that original fiscal note if you have
 
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
in that original fiscal note if you have
that

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
does everybody have that those original
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
charts representative gene again
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes um i i do have that chart um i think
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
the thought was and and maybe this isn't
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
true but i thought the thought was that
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
if the bet
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
when businesses
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but when
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
businesses pay the bpt
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's with the reduction of the bet
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
against it therefore if there's no bp
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
bet reduction
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
would the bpt still be about the same or
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's why we thought there may
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
in our original fiscal note i don't do
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
you said you have that i'm sure i refer
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
to the right so it's um bullet number
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
eight in section c
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
um speaks to that relationship between
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
um the bet credit available to offset
 
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.590 align:start position:0%
um the bet credit available to offset
bpt

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.549 align:start position:0%
bpt
and

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
that analysis was is not included in
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note any sort of assumption
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
represent
representative

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah my follow-up just was just that i
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
mean right you were assuming that in
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
this chart that both of them were being
 
00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
this chart that both of them were being
reduced

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
so now that the b e t is not being
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
reduced the bpt
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers here would still be the same
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
for bpt
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
for for our estimated fiscal analysis
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
based on a prior um prior fiscal year
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
revenue that would be the case so we
 
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.149 align:start position:0%
revenue that would be the case so we
didn't

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't make this an assumption of
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
what taxpayers would use for that
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
because it's it would seem to me that if
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're not lowering the bet by the
 
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
we're not lowering the bet by the
estimated

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
27.5 million that means that's an extra
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
27.5 million that the bpt
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be you know the tax would apply to
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
so therefore the loss in the bpt i would
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
think would be lower than the eight
 
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
think would be lower than the eight
point

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.470 align:start position:0%
point
uh

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
yeah the eight point four seven so maybe
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's around eight million
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
so would that be reasonable i don't yeah
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would i appreciate the
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
question i don't think it would be a
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable assumption to assume that all
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
bet paid
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
is used to offset bpt entirely
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
um some that that isn't the case for
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
some tax payers for many taxpayers
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
didn't analyze that
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
if keane wants to provide a comment
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to add to that comment
 
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to add to that comment
also

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
in our analysis we didn't take into
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
account that we
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers may only pay bet and some
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers may only just pay bbt
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
and some have a combination of both bpt
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
and bet so in order uh so our analysis
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
is it more of a standalone
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
oh sorry our analysis is more of a
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
standalone analysis in terms of just the
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
bpt calculation and the bet calculation
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
without taking into consideration the
 
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
without taking into consideration the
crossover

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
crossover
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
of application of uh bet over bpt
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's going to be a much more
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
complicated analysis
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we were able to to
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
manage that
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why the
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh the rate reduction of just the bpt is
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
still the same
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
same analysis the same value as as the
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
original calculation
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh elmy yes thank you it
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
may be a more complicated analysis but
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
what would it take to do that
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
would you have to go and open up
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
people's folders in the basement as we
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.350 align:start position:0%
um
because

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
that would probably mean
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
a detailed look into every taxpayer to
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
determine who is you which taxpayers
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
utilizing bet and bpt bet credits
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
against bpt
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
against bpt
um

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
that that i think that's just
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
and the analysis is an individual
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer analysis doesn't show
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
the analysis system isn't capable of
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
picking those out
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
we can definitely take a harder look at
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
that and get back to the committee
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
and try and make an assumption on the
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
usage of the vet
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
credits against bpt
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
could you do it before the eighth
 
00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
could you do it before the eighth
yes

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
i mean the other way to look at this is
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
this 8.47 would be a worst case scenario
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that not lowering the bet most
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
likely is lowering this
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
to below 8 million would that be i mean
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
if that's a
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
a fair
 
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.669 align:start position:0%
a fair
um

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
guesstimate then then
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need to put you through
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
more analysis unless you don't think
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
i mean how
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that i think the
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
the effect of the bet credit with the
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
rate unchanged would be an
 
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.510 align:start position:0%
rate unchanged would be an
indeterminable

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
positive effect on this analysis
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
as you say
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
another important note to point out is
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
that this analysis is based on fiscal
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
year 21 revenues
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
we use that as a tax base to determine
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
the impact but i do agree with your
 
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.669 align:start position:0%
the impact but i do agree with your
assumption

00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i mean unless you think otherwise mr
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman maybe we
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
we move forward with the assumption that
 
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.549 align:start position:0%
we move forward with the assumption that
it's

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
less than this figure this is a worst
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
case scenario it's probably less than
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
eight million
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
if that's what the committee wants
 
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
if that's what the committee wants
uh

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're not going to
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
get any
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
additional information that's going to
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
really sway us it's either going to be
 
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.870 align:start position:0%
really sway us it's either going to be
8.4

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
7.8

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
7.8
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
or 8.5 this isn't going to make much of
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
albany are we sure it's less than 8
 
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
albany are we sure it's less than 8
billion

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
why are we sure it's less than eight
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
million and which year are we talking
 
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:38.310 align:start position:0%
million and which year are we talking
about

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
so our estimated fiscal analysis based
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
on fy 21 revenues
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
places the timing of the impact at 1.8
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 23
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
up to a full impact of 8. just under 8.5
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
and fiscally are 25.
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
based on the comments of representative
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
genegan it's
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a reasonable assumption
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
that if you do not decrease the bet rate
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
it would have a
 
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.190 align:start position:0%
it would have a
an

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
indeterminable positive impact on that
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
estimated impact
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
as some taxpayers
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
which we have not analyzed can
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
use that bet paid as a credit against
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative when we get to 24
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
if most of that
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
sorry when we get to 24 we were looking
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
at a 23 million dollar impact on the bpt
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
when we take the bet out of the equation
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
and if most of the taxpayers were paying
 
00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:52.310 align:start position:0%
and if most of the taxpayers were paying
bet

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
we could have another 10 million that
 
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
we could have another 10 million that
year

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
it would be really nice to have
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
the analysis if the if the system will
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
i realize that take going down to the
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
basement and looking at the files is not
 
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
basement and looking at the files is not
on

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
we'll take a harder look at that
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
relationship in our analysis and we'll
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
get back to the committee
 
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
get back to the committee
soon

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it won't be by the 8th it'll be
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i understand and if we can't do it and
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
we pass this anyway we're going to need
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
it for
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
um is it appropriate to talk in general
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
about the bill at this point
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes um
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
i feel the the bet
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
is paid by our more uh
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
invested businesses in new hampshire
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's more of them it would have a
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
a better impact on those businesses than
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
the bpt
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
the money that they would save would be
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
in turn go back into the economy locally
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
and whereas the bpt savings would
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
not necessarily stay in new hampshire
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
and i think that should be a
 
00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:51.509 align:start position:0%
and i think that should be a
consideration

00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
as well as what representative major
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
said last time
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
when we were sitting here that
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
maybe we should let
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the cuts we've made settle down before
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
we make more
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is we shouldn't make any
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
cuts at all but if we do
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
it should be the bet
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
representative

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
um yes i i would
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
i would count it out with the fact that
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know a cut to the be one of the
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
reasons we're not cutting the bet is
 
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.190 align:start position:0%
reasons we're not cutting the bet is
because

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
it is a much much bigger impact there
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and because of that same reasoning we
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
want things to settle down
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
we are willing to leave that
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
and not cut any other taxes but the
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
focus would be just on this bpt tax uh
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
reduction from 7.6 to 7.5
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
i mean the
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
i did a little more digging to make sure
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
more accurate figures we compare
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
favorably with some other surrounding
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
states at 7.5 percent massachusetts
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
charges a flat 8 percent tax
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
on bpt so
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
while there's not a big difference
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
between 7.6 and 7.5
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's still more of a round number it's a
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
little bigger of a of a difference and
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
then maine
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry vermont uh charges anywhere
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
between six and eight and a half percent
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
the um but really the six percent is
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
only on the first ten thousand
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
um you're up to eight and a half percent
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
as soon as a business has more than 25
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
000 of taxable profits which is not a
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
very high figure so for the most part
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
vermont's at eight and a half percent
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is at eight percent um
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
i know some have been concerned that
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
we're giving
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
some big companies a tax break um that
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
in their opinion they don't need however
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of large employers
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
state um that that offer good jobs i
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
mean fidelity is one of them um good
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
high-paying professional jobs you have
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
many hospitals that are in the top 100
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
employers in the state and they um
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
employ many people
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they're also
 
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.310 align:start position:0%
and they're also
um

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
they've got a lot of good jobs in in
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
those companies so i think you know
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not all bad if we're if
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're helping out
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
big businesses in this state
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's certainly an advance to
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
that and then of course the other side
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
is outsiders looking in saying
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's got a 7.5 percent
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
business profits tax i think it just has
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
a good look and i think
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know as we said earlier willing to
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
take other tax cuts off the table to let
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
things settle down but this is one i
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
think we need to let move forward
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i spoke to this point uh
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
previously but i'm going to
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
underscore it again my town in jeffrey
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
is facing a three dollar
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
per thousand tax
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
as a direct consequence of a
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
significant cut in state schooling
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
and there'll be a vote on that
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
increase will impact
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
the big companies and the small
 
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.190 align:start position:0%
the big companies and the small
companies

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
all the commercial enterprises that are
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
located in jaffrey along with of course
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
our residents and residents who pay
 
00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
our residents and residents who pay
taxes

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to bear that in mind
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are two bills in the senate
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
that will provide additional school aid
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
towns like jeffrey and
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
and another one is rindge
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
the cooperative school district is
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
jeffrey renz as you may know
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
and uh that money is desperately needed
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
it may be provided but there'll be
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
always a question of whether there are
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
sufficient state funds to support it
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
lose that
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
because we need to make this gesture
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
which is essentially what it is
 
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.349 align:start position:0%
which is essentially what it is
uh

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the business profits tax side
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh so i just wanted to make that clear
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
considers this
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
when you compare one state against the
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
other on their taxes
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
you have to look at all the taxes
 
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
you have to look at all the taxes
and

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is doing pretty good on
 
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is doing pretty good on
the

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
were competitive now about the states if
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
but it's not just business profits tax
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
all these businesses
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
pay in maine
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a maine vermont
 
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.109 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a maine vermont
massachusetts

00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
and a sales tax on their goods
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
which where in new hampshire we don't
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay any of those things
 
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
have to pay any of those things
so

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
we need to consider these things
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we go forward
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i was
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
i made those comments not in favor or
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
against i just wanted to make sure
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
which is establishing a national service
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
alumni attraction and retention fund
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
and representative schoenberg
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
is not able to make it here today
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
and so representative murphy
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg is not here
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
today and so he asked me last week if i
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
might introduce his amendment to 15 24.
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh i did hand it out it is amendment
 
00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:39.270 align:start position:0%
uh i did hand it out it is amendment
0722h

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
along with the 65 to 25 uh paper that
 
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
along with the 65 to 25 uh paper that
uh

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
illustrates the um the goal to have
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
about 65 percent of our young people or
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
our working force
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
with a degree greater than high school
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
by the year 25 which is endorsed by
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
their governor and
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
businesses throughout the state
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
gave me some written testimony that he
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
would like me to read and i will
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
paraphrase some of it
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
i believe that this uh amendment uh
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
tries to address some of the
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions that were brought
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
up previously in in work sessions
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know as we know this um
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
bill is really an attempt to recruit and
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
retain really qualified caring community
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
service individuals to our state
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's basically to establish a fund
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
called the national service alumni
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
attraction and retention from fund
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
in the the treasury
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
that would allow volunteer new hampshire
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
which is actually one of 52 state
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
service commissions across the country
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
which makes grants to
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
colleges it would be our new hampshire
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
colleges and public private nonprofit
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
employers in the national service
 
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:55.270 align:start position:0%
employers in the national service
network

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
as we know volunteer new hampshire is a
 
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
as we know volunteer new hampshire is a
5013

00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
5013
 
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.390 align:start position:0%
5013
501

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
501
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
c 3 nonprofit organization
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
which is somewhat of in my mind what
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like a quasi governmental uh
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
institution as it's attached to the
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
governed by a board who is appointed by
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
the governor in the executive council
 
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.589 align:start position:0%
the governor in the executive council
um

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
comments that
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg wanted to make
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
section 4
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 1 line 7
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
this fund was hereby established in the
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
state treasury just to make sure that
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
everybody knows where this fund is
 
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.309 align:start position:0%
everybody knows where this fund is
located

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
located
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
same section for roman numeral one line
 
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
same section for roman numeral one line
nine

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh after the word assistance words
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
workforce development and education are
 
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.109 align:start position:0%
workforce development and education are
inserted

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
inserted
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically to establish the explicit you
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
section four again roman numeral two
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
lines 19 to 21
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
allows the commissioner the department
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
of the administrative services to accept
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
and credit funds from various revenue
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
such as grants or donations stipulated
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the fund
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
other sections like
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
section 4 roman numeral 3 lines
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
22 to 30
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
shows the parameters
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
and importantly
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the new word is
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
is is transferred versus
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
hereby appropriated which was
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
implied as a budget appropriation for
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that was really not the intent of
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the original prime sponsor
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
all these funds are coming from
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds from the arpa fund
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan act of 21
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
and still remains within the power of
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
this really is a three-year innocence
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
pilot program it is really intended to
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
try to recruit and retain
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
what i think we would all consider some
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
very valuable resources uh in
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who may contribute
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
substantially to our educational system
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
but also to our workforce
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
interestingly i was driving down this
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
morning and listening on the radio and i
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
forget which station i was on but our
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
neighboring state vermont
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
and i didn't real i realized this before
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
but i forgot is actually the number one
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
oldest state in the country i think
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're a number two or three and their
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
major issue right now is workforce
 
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.390 align:start position:0%
major issue right now is workforce
retention

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to keep some of the young
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
individuals of the state to stay in the
 
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.870 align:start position:0%
individuals of the state to stay in the
state

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
from personal experience i know from
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
where i live up in the upper valley
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
many people unless their
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
children are tied directly to a business
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
a family business
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
people leave in the state
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so what this is really an intent to
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
do is to recruit some of the best
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
qualified um you know value-oriented
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
community-oriented individuals to stay
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
personally when i was you know in
 
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
personally when i was you know in
practice

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of the hardest things i think most
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
people here recognize as well recruiting
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
and retaining good people is very hard
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
and it's very costly and if we have a
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
relatively cheap meaning no money is
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
expended by the state only through the
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
opera funds
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
we may be able to establish a program
 
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.829 align:start position:0%
we may be able to establish a program
whereby

00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
going forward we can look to see what
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
happens in three years if in fact in
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
three years we see that there is a
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
sizable uptick in the number of people
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
that are recruited to go to college here
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
stay here or in the workforce stay here
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
i think then we can start looking at
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
alternative ways to fund this whether it
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
be grants or federal supportives of that
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
be grants or federal supportives of that
nature

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
but regardless this is a
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
basically a pilot program in a sense for
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
three years using the monies that are
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
allocated through arpa to try and
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to have people i know from
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
personally recruiting people at various
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
levels of training and in practice
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard to bring people to new
 
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's hard to bring people to new
hampshire

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
they think that we border on canada and
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
they are afraid of that they know we
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
have cold hard winters they are not
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with new hampshire but
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
personally having recruited a number of
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
people who are really qualified and
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
talented people when they come to the
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
state and they realize who lives here
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
who works here
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
they actually are the ones that want to
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
stay here
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
i would give you an example we have now
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the department of orthopedics at
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth over 50 percent of the
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
candidates or the staff members there
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
are people that actually came from
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country but chose to
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire it's hard to
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you know looking at a
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
brochure of new hampshire with foliage
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
and beautiful pictures in the ocean
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
but unless they actually live here and
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
work here and get to know people it's
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
hard to recruit these people in the
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
state i think this gives us a great
 
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
state i think this gives us a great
opportunity

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
through a pilot program without any
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
financial burden on our taxpayers to see
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
if this can't be a tool that we can use
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
going forward to recruit and retain some
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the best
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
and so that's my personal you know aside
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
from what representative schamberg put
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
out there but i do think it's really an
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
important concept to consider
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that we are an aging
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
population in the state we need to
 
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.069 align:start position:0%
population in the state we need to
consider

00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
some of the workforce
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
retention programs
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we have currently in place or don't
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
have in place and see if we can improve
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
upon those
 
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.430 align:start position:0%
upon those
to

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
improve our workforce situation uh
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
through this program so um
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
i probably went a little off script
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
um but i think it's a valuable program a
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
great concept
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that we could find a
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
make this happen in our state
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out i just wanted
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
to point out that even
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
if um
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
coming out of our budget it's
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
250 000
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
a year to be attracting and
 
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.670 align:start position:0%
a year to be attracting and
and

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
getting to stay the very age group that
 
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
getting to stay the very age group that
we

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.710 align:start position:0%
we
really

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
need to settle in new hampshire to keep
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
or keep settled in new hampshire
 
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
or keep settled in new hampshire
and

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
develop businesses
 
00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
develop businesses
become

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
really strong employees of existing
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.349 align:start position:0%
really strong employees of existing
businesses

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it's cheap
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 500
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
up up to 500 up to six thousand dollars
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
per student
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
and if there's someone here from
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire i'd love to
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
see i'm sure they had something to do
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
with this language like to see on how
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
many people they think they might be
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting in a year
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
chairman i just wanted to add that when
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
i was listening to the vermont uh
 
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
i was listening to the vermont uh
program

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
not only are they in trying to encourage
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
young people to stay in the state who
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
are leaving but they also are out of
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
their own coffers are actually
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
offering financial incentives to people
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr murphy for stepping in for
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to track exactly what is
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
new subdivision for roman numeral three
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
and roman numeral
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
four and make sure i understand the
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
mechanics so
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
basically each individual
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
a grant ranging between five hundred
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
dollars and three thousand dollars
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
for a term
 
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.270 align:start position:0%
for a term
and

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
that that uh use of the word term i
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
think is saying a term of
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
national service
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
would that be a year what is what does
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
that mean a a term of national service
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
i can't i think it's a is it one year or
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
i thought it was two years actually
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
peace corps is two-year commitment i
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
think of course i believe one year
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct peace corps is two years
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe the uh
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh national service is one one year yeah
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
my quick initial read
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
i thought this was referring to a term
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
at school in any institution or
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
community college system but when i read
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
it more closely i
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
realized it it doesn't tie to terms of
 
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
realized it it doesn't tie to terms of
study

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
it ties to terms of service already put
 
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.630 align:start position:0%
it ties to terms of service already put
in

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's fairly ambiguous in terms of how
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
it would be applied
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh to the terms of study
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know are we talking per semester
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
multi-year i do see of course at the end
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the paragraph that it's
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
limited to an aggregate of six thousand
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
dollars which i assume
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
contemplates multiple semesters or years
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
of study
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
i would think that needs to be ironed
 
00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:55.829 align:start position:0%
i would think that needs to be ironed
out

00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree and i but i i think
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
that it's important to know also that
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
this in my understanding is that this is
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
quote a matching grant so
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
each of the universities and or the
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
employers have to first come up with the
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh up to three thousand dollars and then
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh volunteer new hampshire will match
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
that um contribution that they've made
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
to their education or to their
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
forgiveness of debt okay so you've
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated if i can continue mr
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman you've anticipated my second
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
question which was
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
what exactly is it that they're matching
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and uh you've just stated it but i don't
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
think it's stated here in the language
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that the universe
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is it all right
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the university
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
um or the community college system
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
has to have joined
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
americorps schools of service
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
or the peace corps coverdale fellowships
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
if they are part of that organization
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
then they will then be able to
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
give a grant of up to three thousand
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
dollars matched by volunteer new
 
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
dollars matched by volunteer new
hampshire

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
for those that are in employ or going
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
into employment
 
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.470 align:start position:0%
into employment
the

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
employer has to be have joined the
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
employers of national service program
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
again another program that tries to tie
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers to employers and if they are
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
part of that program then they can then
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
offer a grant which is then um
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
or they can offer monies up to 3000
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
matched by a grant from volunteer new
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire but
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
it probably needs some tidying up on the
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
the language otherwise
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
who's matching what
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
and volunteer new hampshire shall
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
disperse the matching grant
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a new role for
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire that we didn't
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how that interjects
 
00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.349 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how that interjects
them

00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
into a fund
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
controlled by the
 
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
controlled by the
treasurer

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
by the state treasury
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think the mechanics of those three
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
issues are all muddy
 
00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:13.990 align:start position:0%
issues are all muddy
um

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
if i made one more sorry being very
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
technical here
 
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
technical here
uh

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
i was trying to discern the difference
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
between uh roman numeral three and roman
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
and please help me if if i
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
don't have this right
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
first i thought it was redundant it was
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
an inadvertent inclusion twice but uh
 
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.309 align:start position:0%
an inadvertent inclusion twice but uh
maybe

00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
maybe roman numeral four is trying to
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
get at something a little bit different
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that is if you're not going to be a
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
student and you're not looking for
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
financial aid prospectively
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
instead you would get a grant of the
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
same sort of figure
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
to apply against your debt service for
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
loans that you already are obligated to
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah my
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding and again i didn't
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
write it and i'm not as familiar as
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
others may be with the program but my
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that roman numeral 3
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
really is dealing with the
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
educational system meaning that if they
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
are students that come after service in
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
the peace corps or americorps
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
the university system may provide them
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
with some
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
grant money that is then matched by
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire paragraph or
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 4 is specifically
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
virtually identical language in many
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
ways but it is dealing with the employer
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
who hires an employee to come to the
 
00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:34.710 align:start position:0%
who hires an employee to come to the
state

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then they will have their
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
debt on student loans reduced by the
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
same amount so the employer will give
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
them you know some sum of money up to 3
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
000 and it will be matched by volunteer
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so that's my understanding
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
that that helps
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
i do think that this needs to be revised
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for you to send to
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
me your three bullet items at some point
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i will try to
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
see if we can get those uh answered for
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
you sure glad thank you
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay so representative spiltsbury will
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
work with representative murphy
 
00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:17.670 align:start position:0%
work with representative murphy
to

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
get this ad
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.190 align:start position:0%
all right
then

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry all right
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
now we're on the house
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
forward at the tom and see what happens
 
00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
forward at the tom and see what happens
15.65

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
okay 1565 relative to the

an updated amendment uh
2022-0747-h

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
which i handed out to everyone also
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
handed out a spreadsheet to go along
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
with it
but

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's different in this
 
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's different in this
amendment

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
prior to the other amendment that i had
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
and to the bill itself
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
is on line 14
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
that i changed the allocation factor
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
from 40 percent to 30 percent
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that was um in response to a good
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
call by uh representative allmey
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 40 percent factor if
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
what a 40
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
factor in the uh
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
calculation regarding uh the settlement
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
distributions and and this one on the
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet is just using mckinsey
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
with a 40 percent factor it actually
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
splits the fund 53 percent and 47
 
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.390 align:start position:0%
splits the fund 53 percent and 47
percent

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.910 align:start position:0%
percent
um

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
because of the uh
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
correction that i've made to the
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
population penalty
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
make this factor 30 instead it is then a
 
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.069 align:start position:0%
make this factor 30 instead it is then a
true

00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
split of the fund of 40
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions that joined in
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit initially
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
and 60 percent would remain in the fund
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
so if we look at
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
column j
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
that shows
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
what the result of a 30 percent factor
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
versus what the actual
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
distribution of the settlement was in
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
column h
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
which goes with the
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
current 15 percent
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
allocation of the fund
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
and includes the population penalty to
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:23.589 align:start position:0%
the counties
so

00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
so that's all this uh this amendment
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
will accomplish it also adds in
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
reporting changes and
 
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.190 align:start position:0%
reporting changes and
includes

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
includes
the

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
changes that are recommended by senator
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%

00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.230 align:start position:0%
rosenwald in her bill in her senate bill
275

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
275
 
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
275
so

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's what this
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
amendment does and i hope that it
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
will be acceptable to committee
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there are some folks
 
01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.069 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there are some folks
here

01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%

adding in another
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of what the commission is trying

to accomplish one other piece of this
 
01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
to accomplish one other piece of this
too

that
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
on line 9
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the distribution of funds from
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
from the the
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
opioid trust fund shall be based on the
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
most recent decennial census population
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
in current statute
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
it only points to the um
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
the 2010 census so we're just making it
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to keep changing
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
i see these mostly as
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
um minor change manual tweaks
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
they're kind of housekeeping things
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
right and you've incorporated those into
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment as well and your big
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
change in here is 30 instead of 40 is
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
the allocation formula yeah
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay senate bill
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
275 that's past the senate as amended
 
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.870 align:start position:0%
275 that's past the senate as amended
and

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 275
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it specifies the 15 percent as
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
has been agreed in the past so it
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that so the senate has
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
already passed that
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
and what you're proposing
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
is to change it to 30 percent
 
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
is to change it to 30 percent
right

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
right
and

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
well the senate i don't think um
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
were was considering uh
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the the allocation factor and i it
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't written anything about the
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
allocation factor in there in the bill
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
there anyway
 
01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:29.270 align:start position:0%
there anyway
so

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
all the things that you talked about
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
that the senate did
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
but what they didn't do
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
is they did not change the percent
 
01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:45.990 align:start position:0%
is they did not change the percent
factor

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
they have base
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
to continue on
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
using that 15 factor
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
and then
also

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
beefing up the commission
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the allocation of
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
the 85 percent
 
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.270 align:start position:0%
the 85 percent
adding

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
some additional
 
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.069 align:start position:0%
some additional
people

01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
people
and

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the nursing home administrator appointed
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
the county rather than the governor
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
that so that the 85
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
is distributed as needed
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
with need
 
01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
with need
so

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
we do have a big difference here if your
 
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
we do have a big difference here if your
amendment

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change that factor
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
right right well senator rosenwald's
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill didn't even
 
01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.549 align:start position:0%
bill didn't even
discuss

01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
a change in the allocation factor not
 
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.390 align:start position:0%
a change in the allocation factor not
because

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
they don't want it i think it's because
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
representing elmi
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the senate bill
 
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
on the senate bill
was

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
amended in the
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
senate before they passed it
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
they discussed it they added in
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
some change
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh the commission
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of which you've captured which is
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
is appointing the county nursing home
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
supervisor by the association of
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
counties which is a very good idea
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
instead of the governor
 
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
instead of the governor
and

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
the other of which is a
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools appointed by
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school administrators
 
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school administrators
association

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
and they made some changes to
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
accommodate that in the commission
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then they also
 
01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.150 align:start position:0%
and then they also
on

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
put in a specific
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
number 16 for
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the school problems
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know with opioids
 
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.109 align:start position:0%
you know with opioids
and

01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
and
they

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
put into the tasks of the commission on
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they should pay attention to
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the available measures success and
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
corresponding data of the programs
 
01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
corresponding data of the programs
so

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a moving target if
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
you're trying to create something that
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
would do everything they did except
 
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
would do everything they did except
change

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
change the numbers i think
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
you should probably just assume that
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
that if this passed the house that
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
there'd have to be a committee of
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
conference yeah
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
i i was just anticipating some of the
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
changes that may have come from the
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
senate and incorporating it into this
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
i think though
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
the allocation formula
 
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
the allocation formula
and

01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know whether it comes that comes
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion comes from the house or the
 
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.230 align:start position:0%
suggestion comes from the house or the
senate

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's just important for us to
 
01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
i think it's just important for us to
consider

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
the original 85 15
 
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.630 align:start position:0%
the original 85 15
split

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
split
 
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.150 align:start position:0%
split
was

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
suggest was a suggestion from a judge in
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
ohio many a couple of years ago
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
and that over time you know we can take
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
a look and see
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
how the that um allocation
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
affects our
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
counties and uh and our uh
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities that originally joined
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to to bear in
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
mind that there are other states that
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
have also already
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
altered that original
 
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.349 align:start position:0%
altered that original
um

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
85 15 split because they found it wasn't
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
really meeting their needs
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that when we look at the the
 
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:04.549 align:start position:0%
and i think that when we look at the the
um

01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
the 23 political subdivisions that
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
joined into this lawsuit and if it
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't for them
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know that we would be
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
even talking about having any money
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
in this fund to begin with
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
but be that as it may
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
i mean these 23 uh entities
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
represent a good 50
 
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
represent a good 50
percent

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
of the opioid problems in the state
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
so it just seems to me to make more
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
sense that instead of them getting a 15
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent cut of whatever settlements are
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
coming that they should get a bigger
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
amount of that funding
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
to the tune of maybe 40 percent
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
with 60 percent which is a huge amount
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
of money still to be left in the fund
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
for other municipalities to to ask for
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.070 align:start position:0%

01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i have been trying to get
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
data we have data
 
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
data we have data
on

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.709 align:start position:0%
on
the

01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
distribution of deaths which show that
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere in new hampshire
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.510 align:start position:0%
we have uh
the

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
the largest problem is in manchester
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
that's quite obvious
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
and then nashua because of their
 
01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.430 align:start position:0%
and then nashua because of their
populations

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
and because they're
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
on the roots of the drug
 
01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
on the roots of the drug
drug

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
drug
 
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.269 align:start position:0%
drug
highways

01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
i lived on the gainesville drug
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
highway many many years ago and it
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
suffered badly from
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
drugs because of that
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that they come into
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
places like unity and spread out across
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
all of the rural areas
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
around the upper valley
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
they come into
 
01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:01.510 align:start position:0%
they come into
to

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
berlin and spread all over
 
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.270 align:start position:0%
berlin and spread all over
on

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
there is no place that is exempt from
 
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
there is no place that is exempt from
this

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
this
and

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
in general the research seems to show
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
that addiction
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
is more serious
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the rural areas that because the
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
people are isolated
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't have good access
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
to treatment programs that are in the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
big cities
 
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.630 align:start position:0%
big cities
but

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're 13 which is what we're talking
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
about because the counties
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
represent the state
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
but the 13 that you're talking about
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
leave out
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
big towns
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire as well as
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
almost all of the rural areas
 
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.310 align:start position:0%
almost all of the rural areas
and

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
the commission seems to be very well
 
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.709 align:start position:0%
the commission seems to be very well
diversified

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
diversified
 
01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:03.669 align:start position:0%
diversified
to

01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
and has been working out priorities
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
and i wish that one of the people from
 
01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:11.350 align:start position:0%
and i wish that one of the people from
that

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
would come and talk to us here besides
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
attorney befetti who's mostly
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
talking just about the allocation but
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
not about what the commission is doing
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
well i no one i i i'm sorry okay anybody
 
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
well i no one i i i'm sorry okay anybody
else

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
you want to turn your mic on
 
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
you want to turn your mic on
right

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh picking up on
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative omni's
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
referral to what the commission
 
01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
referral to what the commission
uh

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
is set up to do
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at the criteria here
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
that are in the statute
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
that would be added to
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the two
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
additional paragraphs that have been
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
referenced by others
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's evident that much of the money that
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
goes to the commission
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
will flow through to
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions where there is a
 
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions where there is a
need

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and of course there'll be a great need
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
in manchester for example
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and much of the money will flow
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
through to manchester or more close
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
closer to my home
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
to cane
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
two political subdivisions that will
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
also be receiving a direct
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money through the 15 percent
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
as the statute is currently written for
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
as the statute is currently written for
example

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh these are the criteria that the
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
commission is to follow
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
and if this follows after a statement
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
funds may be awarded if the project
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
meets one of the following criteria
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and any political subdivision within
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
for any portion of the cost of
 
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
for any portion of the cost of
administering

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
administering
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.870 align:start position:0%
administering
naloxone

01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
naloxone
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
well that's uh you know that's a
 
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.870 align:start position:0%
well that's uh you know that's a
per

01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
administration kind of
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program that's going to
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
flow to places where
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
the naloxone is being administered
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that's going to include
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
the big places that have
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
very intense involvement in this issue
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
and other places that have less intense
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh reimburse the state and any public
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
any and any political subdivision for
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
emergency response services related to
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know these issues
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
same thing it's going to flow through
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
to and within
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
these political subdivisions so
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
my point is that a lot of that 85
 
01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.630 align:start position:0%
my point is that a lot of that 85
percent

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
is going to go to places that are also
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
receiving the 15
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's not 85 percent
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
here and then 15
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm struggling with is that this is
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
we passed this change it goes on forever
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
and obviously another legislature can
 
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
and obviously another legislature can
change

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
what the future looks like but
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.709 align:start position:0%
excuse me
but

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
these 13
 
01:14:36.159 --> 01:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
these 13
towns

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to benefit from ever
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative ames is correct does
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
those represent me
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
first of all i don't have a problem with
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the money going to the counties
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
forever i think because the word nimble
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
was used somewhere in one of the
 
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.070 align:start position:0%
was used somewhere in one of the
hearings

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the counties are closer to the to
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
the action
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i could see i could make an argument
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
for more money going to the counties
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then having them work their programs
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
they know their county's the best
 
01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
they know their county's the best
but

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
for all these towns to continue to get
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we talked about another
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
settlement just the other day 115
 
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.430 align:start position:0%
settlement just the other day 115
million

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
from the distributors like abbott and
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
all the others
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that's the tip of the iceberg
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be more settlements
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
um that we're gonna we're gonna lock
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
these these 13
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
communities in
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
for a long time now i know that's not
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
the bill we're not here to say
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't do it we're here to say do they
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
get 30 now not over 40 percent
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh i just i can't
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's right
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i would i would i would agree with
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe more money going to the counties
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
let them work their programs i mean in
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
my little town at stratham i mean
 
01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:53.830 align:start position:0%
my little town at stratham i mean
greenland

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
greenland
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have we don't have
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's drug problems
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
but we don't have facilities or we don't
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
have anything you know we're never going
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
to ask for that kind of money
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh because we'll be going to the the
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
the communities that are larger that
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
have those kind of kind of things
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and it and it to me
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
our county rockingham
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
would be better equipped to accept money
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.310 align:start position:0%
that would
benefit

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
all of the community all the the other
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions the community the towns et
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
cetera in the county
 
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
cetera in the county
so

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i mean i guess what's on the
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
table right now
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
is that we increase this to 30 percent
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
not 40 percent
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
and not touch any of the other and then
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
down the road i think we're going to
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
have to address
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
the 13 towns do they forever
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i i would agree that the county
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
should get
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
money and let them let them work that
 
01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
money and let them let them work that
part

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we have time to argue
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
now and try to change this
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
to amend out these towns that's another
 
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
to amend out these towns that's another
discussion

01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm having problems
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
even you know look the agreement was 15
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
where i'm still right now is well let's
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
stay with the 15
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have the argument another
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
day about
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
um you know continuing to change this
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
formula but that that's that's what i'm
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
thinking right now thank you
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else know
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
that representative yeah mr chair thank
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
you i'm i'm wondering if there's anybody
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
here from any of the other
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities or counties that would
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
like to add in or any
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
of their observations or thoughts about
 
01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.750 align:start position:0%
of their observations or thoughts about
this

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
since this is a work session
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
if anybody has information they want to
 
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.149 align:start position:0%
if anybody has information they want to
provide

01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you
 
01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you
administrators

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

fine
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you would summarize
 
01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
if you would summarize
because

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a public hearing it's a work
 
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.870 align:start position:0%
it's not a public hearing it's a work
session

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
um

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to discussion i
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
actually came to a previous one when uh
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
um manager uh uh perlin friendlin uh
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
spoke and
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
well i wanted to
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
let kate take care of her side of things
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
but i wanted from the county's
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
perspective from cheshire county
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
especially how we would look at this
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
money anytime we can have
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
funding come in
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
and take that layer out and we can
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
directly have
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
those monies come into the county we
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't look it as we do look internally
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
and i know that there's been talk about
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
m a t we we've had m18 in our budget for
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
years we were one of the first counties
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
to in in our county facility and our
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
in our corrections facility to have mat
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
medical assisted treatment
 
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
medical assisted treatment
um

01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
so suboxone whatever it may be
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
um that the individuals that are coming
 
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.149 align:start position:0%
um that the individuals that are coming
in

01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:20.159 --> 01:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
in
and

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
when i looked at this money and
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
currently we have about six little over
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand dollars coming in i
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
look at it the same way we looked at
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
when the cares money came out initially
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
it came through the state and we were
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
grateful to have any money come into us
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
but we advocated hard for when the if
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was going to be any more funding
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan funding
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to come directly to us
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
because we know our communities and when
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
county talks about community
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just about the counties not
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
just about the infrastructure we're
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
talking about the 22 towns in cheshire
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
county in the city of keene
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
so when we look at things we're looking
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
at as a whole
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
and and we've done so we believe we've
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
done some really creative things with
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
our american rescue plan monies we would
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
do the same thing here let's talk first
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
start with drug court drug court we have
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
a mid-size so we've received from the
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire agreement before
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
you go on further
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
are you advocating going from the 15 to
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
the 30 percent or i'm always advocating
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
anytime that yes i appreciate the the
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
work that representative aaron has done
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
in this that if we could bump that up to
 
01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
in this that if we could bump that up to
30

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
that would be great because we believe
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
we can utilize that money in many
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
different ways that you may not be aware
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
of okay thank you thank you mr chair and
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
you're representing another county so i
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
am the executive director of the new
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of counties and i
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make the committee aware
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
that all 10 counties are in full support
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
of this and many of the items that
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
administrator coats is speaking of other
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
counties want to do
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
things like building out the mat
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
programs so it's not just we're treating
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
them in the county jails and then
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
sending them out we could use this money
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
to partner with non-profits to continue
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
their treatment in the communities and
 
01:21:08.639 --> 01:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
their treatment in the communities and
benefit

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
all the communities in each county
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
because the worst thing that can happen
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
is we're providing them with mat in the
 
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
is we're providing them with mat in the
jail

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
we send them out they relapse they're
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
back in the jail
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
within a year and then it's just an
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
endless cycle so if we could have that
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
handoff i think that opportunity would
 
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.149 align:start position:0%
handoff i think that opportunity would
be

01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
great and the fact that we wouldn't have
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
if we had more funds and didn't have to
 
01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.189 align:start position:0%
if we had more funds and didn't have to
apply

01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
to get those funds for a program that
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
may or may not get approved by the trust
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know the trust rules aren't set
 
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.629 align:start position:0%
we don't know the trust rules aren't set
up

01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
if we got those monies now
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
and any future allocations that's money
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
out on the street faster i think is our
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
point so essentially what you're saying
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
the more money you can get directly that
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to compete for the better
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
off you are correct we can we can we can
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
be as the word would say we can be
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
nimble with it we can get we can get
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
that funding out to those whether it's
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
reality check or whatever it may be and
 
01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.669 align:start position:0%
reality check or whatever it may be and
then

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
those that aren't
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the county
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
but are
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
communities that
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that's not available
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
for them to apply
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to hurt them
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would argue mr chair that the
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
counties cover the entire state so
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not a
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
municipality entered into the agreement
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
a community will benefit
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you they currently are anything
 
01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.629 align:start position:0%
thank you they currently are anything
else

01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:46.550 align:start position:0%
else
representative

01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
i am feeling very uh
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
disturbed that we cannot get someone
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the commission to talk to us about
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
what the commission itself has been
 
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.550 align:start position:0%
what the commission itself has been
deciding

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh except
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the the side of the allocation of
 
01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
on the the side of the allocation of
funds

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
because what i get told by
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
the chair of the commission
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
who is senator rosenwald
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
she was appointed at the beginning and
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
reconfirmed by senator morse
 
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
reconfirmed by senator morse
on

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
the first they've decided that the first
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
thing they're going to they need to fund
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
is the jails
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
on which would be extra money on top of
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the counties get
 
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
whatever the counties get
on

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
the the rules have not been approved yet
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
that is because of as i remember
 
01:23:45.679 --> 01:23:47.430 align:start position:0%
that is because of as i remember
blizzards

01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
blizzards
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
that happened when jail car tried to
 
01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:50.709 align:start position:0%
that happened when jail car tried to
meet

01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they certainly will be approved
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
before this bill would pass the senate
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so this and the senate has direct
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
involvement with this commission
 
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.229 align:start position:0%
involvement with this commission
on

01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
which we don't seem to have
 
01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
which we don't seem to have
and

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.470 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
i just do not understand why we can't
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
get someone else from the commission
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
to talk to us about
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
what they have already decided they are
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
planning on doing in
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
sending the money down because it
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take very long to send it down
 
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.270 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take very long to send it down
once

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
all those rules are finished we do have
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
someone from colorado county i believe
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
do are you spying to speak
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are you speaking i hope too
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes so i i did want to say we did uh
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
plan on having attorney velardi who sits
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
on the uh opioid commission be here
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
today unfortunately he's in court um so
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
he does have a full-time job if you are
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
not planning on executing this bill
 
01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
not planning on executing this bill
today

01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
i can have someone here from the
 
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
i can have someone here from the
commission

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
next week to talk to this group about
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
what they are doing but it is my
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the commission has
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
not decided on how they are going to
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
spend those funds it is news to me that
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
the commission has agreed to fund the
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
mat services because i am
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
unclear that they can make that decision
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
before the rules are approved but
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
i will defer to senator rosenwald but my
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is none of those decisions
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
on how the money in the trust is going
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be spent has been made yet
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay i i will try to get in touch with
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the commission and see if we can have
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
somebody here
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you both because you're my exhibit
 
01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:55.750 align:start position:0%
thank you both because you're my exhibit
a

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.030 align:start position:0%
a
um

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
i just as i was saying
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's it sounds like the counties are are
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
well equipped to act and understand
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
their their communities better than the
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
state does
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that i would have no problem
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
amending this bill to give more money to
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
but i have problem with
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
those initial towns
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i mean obviously
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the towns were within the
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
county so
 
01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
county so
it

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
forever and ever and this money's going
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
to get bigger and bigger that's coming i
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
mean these settlements are going to be
 
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
mean these settlements are going to be
big

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
so i think i think
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
just in terms of nimbleness i think the
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
counties are are more nimble and they
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
understand their communities and would
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
do a pretty good job of allocating some
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
of this money not just to the jails but
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
to to other programs in their their
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
counties so
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
um i mean i've been thinking about this
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
i still have a problem with individual
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
towns getting this forever and ever
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh but you know
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know he actually kind of helped
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
me make my case here so thank you
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%

affected personally by by this
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a 35-year police veteran 20 years as
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%

and my my own family was struck with
 
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.310 align:start position:0%
and my my own family was struck with
this

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
this
and

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
i found myself even with the amount of
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
time and the
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
people that i knew and the connections i
 
01:27:46.239 --> 01:27:47.030 align:start position:0%
people that i knew and the connections i
had

01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the north country
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
i was lost for resources
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
i couldn't when i get the call
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
that my daughter had been arrested
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
and needed help
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any place to bring her
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
there was there was no resources up
 
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.470 align:start position:0%
there was there was no resources up
there

01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
we've tried to grow that fortunately i
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
was able to get a hold of somebody in
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
manchester we talk about the big cities
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about the big towns
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
population based they are getting some
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the resources and i'm not here to
 
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.550 align:start position:0%
of the resources and i'm not here to
compete

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
compete
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm here to tell you that three
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
in in a lawsuit that we filed is not
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
enough for me
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
we look at things that we need
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
because i know that was one of the
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that was asked
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
we need an earlier childhood education
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
where do we go
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
what do we do with our grandchildren how
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
do we take custody of those kids
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with their anger and
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
their frustration moving forward
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole family makeup here
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's not being addressed and that
 
01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
that's not being addressed and that
would

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
is just superficially being touched
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
i can only speak for the north country
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
but i do think that
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
we don't have a loud enough voice and we
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
need those resources
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
we need that percentage increased
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
on i forget whether berlin is one of the
 
01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.830 align:start position:0%
on i forget whether berlin is one of the
13

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
towns it is
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
so you're advocating for berlin
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
the county
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
would share
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
its increase over the entire county
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
but whitefield and
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
such places would not
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
see this the increase that berlin would
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
get it would be concentrated in berlin
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't catch up the formula
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
the way the way it works right now
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh the way that is being proposed
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
is that the county would get an increase
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh based on its population
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that berlin
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
by itself in cost would get
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
to spend in berlin
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're about the third of the population
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh there would be
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes but the other two-thirds would
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
on if they want
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
money would have to compete by
 
01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
money would have to compete by
themselves

01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
maybe with berlin berlin would help them
 
01:30:45.679 --> 01:30:46.870 align:start position:0%
maybe with berlin berlin would help them
compete

01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
compete
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
what we've had to do in the north
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
country is consolidate a lot of our
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
resources and work together um whether
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
that be
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
drug unit or support services and those
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
sort of things so we have worked
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the county
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh to to that point that we need to work
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
together we're all we have
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
yes but uh
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
there are also a lot of places in i
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
understand in coasts that are a long
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
distance from berlin so
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
then we thank you for your
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
comments representative herschel
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is more
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh this is more of a comment
 
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.870 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh this is more of a comment
um

01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
i gotta see how i gotta get to this um
 
01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.550 align:start position:0%
i gotta see how i gotta get to this um
when

01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
when the towns are increased that are on
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
the list
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
along with the counties that are
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
towns are sometimes dependent on
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
counties for assistance does this
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
lessen the assistance that they would
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
ask for the counties to help them with
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
or would the counties not be able to use
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
this money at all to help those cities
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
that are in the litigation
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
the way it works
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
as it is right now 85 15
 
01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
as it is right now 85 15
15

01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
goes directly to these
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
13 communities in the counties
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
do what they want with the money as long
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
as it
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.189 align:start position:0%
has to do with
opioids

01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
the 85 percent
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
will be distributed by this special
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission their recommendation
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
their need
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
and how how it benefits
 
01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.550 align:start position:0%
and how how it benefits
yes

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as a follow-up to
 
01:32:46.159 --> 01:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as a follow-up to
that

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i've read through i read through the
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
legislation earlier and i've i've looked
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
at the at the um a mammoth that's come
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
through and i think that i'm st i'm
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
still missing and maybe i might have
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
missed a hearing or something so forgive
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
me of my ignorance um
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
i i'm still trying to find out or to try
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
why there has to i know that the judge
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
is the one who interpreted the 15 over
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
the case over the cases right the judge
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
said well we're just going to put 15 on
 
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
said well we're just going to put 15 on
there

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
that leaves 85 percent to be requested
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a there's a payout
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's in here from mcken from from
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
mckenzie already in that settlement
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
but why do we feel the need of having to
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
hold back 85 percent
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm trying to figure out why
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
is there a need to hold back 85 percent
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
that question if i understood it
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
why not give these 13 communities in the
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
county 100 insane
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
no i'm i'm saying that i think it's
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable to take it up to 30 percent
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm saying that so much is left over
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
for people to put in a request for that
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
they need help
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
but if if we gave more money to the
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
counties out of the fund still having 60
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the of the of the amount in
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.149 align:start position:0%
the fund
uh

01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
to the counties and and even to the
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
what if if that fund is is already set
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
up for them
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
then why are we making them beg for it
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
why can't we just increase a bit more of
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the of the amount to go to them so
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
they can establish the programs they
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
need to establish or work on the issues
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
they need to work on
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
why does it why does it have to be 85
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
percent i wasn't part of that 85 percent
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is made up of 230
 
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is made up of 230
something

01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
something
communities

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
most of the communities don't have the
 
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
most of the communities don't have the
resources

01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
to even
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
know what's going on or participating
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
in these
 
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.149 align:start position:0%
in these
lawsuits

01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i also know that just about every
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
community there is in new hampshire has
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
a drug problem
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
every community that we have in new
 
01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:14.550 align:start position:0%
every community that we have in new
hampshire

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
has to send their
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
emergency crews out
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
so they have they have expenses as well
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
as these 13 communities
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
the more that
 
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
the more that
we

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
give to
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
give to
the

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
the
litigants

01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
the less there is for all those
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
communities that didn't have the
 
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
communities that didn't have the
resources

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
or the people in place
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
to join this lawsuit
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
so i i have no idea why they did a 15 85
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.470 align:start position:0%
so i i have no idea why they did a 15 85
split

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
split
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
but i do worry about those
 
01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.669 align:start position:0%
but i do worry about those
communities

01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:35:55.679 --> 01:35:56.709 align:start position:0%
communities
that

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
are small
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
still have to operate ambulances they'll
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
have to operate
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
emergency people and all that
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
we address them
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
and they're being addressed
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
by this commission
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
the commission's supposed to look at the
 
01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
the commission's supposed to look at the
needs

01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.229 align:start position:0%
needs
of

01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
where these funds are
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is just the tip of the iceberg
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
because there's more funds coming
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
and a lot more fun to come in
 
01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
and a lot more fun to come in
settlements

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
comments now we have a gentleman in the
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%

with actually
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald at the time
 
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald at the time
and

01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
a deputy attorney bonfetti
 
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
a deputy attorney bonfetti
and

01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner mcglarish
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
from stratford county
 
01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.430 align:start position:0%
from stratford county
and

01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
at the time the 15 percent we were
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
flying blind
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't know
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know so we too we there was we were
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
talking about buckets and we said
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's three buckets there's a state
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
this is trust and then there's the
 
01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:29.189 align:start position:0%
this is trust and then there's the
subdivisions

01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so we went with this number we
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
looked for guidance knowing that that
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
may change down the road because we
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know there wasn't enough
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
information to move forward to make an
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
educated decision at the time so that's
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
why we agreed to the 15 at the time is
 
01:37:43.119 --> 01:37:43.990 align:start position:0%
why we agreed to the 15 at the time is
because

01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
we just didn't know where this could
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
land and we
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with it day in and day out and
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
seeing our community struggle with the
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
issues that they were struggling with we
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
wanted something
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
so i have 16 000 right now set aside for
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
that something but it could if it was
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
more maybe we could do more
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
a comment and then a question and i
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
think it is somewhat related to what we
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
is that rather than
 
01:38:15.199 --> 01:38:16.629 align:start position:0%
is that rather than
considering

01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent thirty percent forty
 
01:38:18.639 --> 01:38:20.470 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent thirty percent forty
percent

01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
in knowing that your recent comment said
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're flying blind
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
it strikes me that from a clinical
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
perspective the idea is to put your
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
resources to where they are needed most
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
not based on an arbitrary you know grab
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
a number out of the air percentage but
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
specifically where the needs are most so
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
my question is then
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
how do we if 30 percent of the the the
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
need is in those
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
13 or 23 whatever the number is counties
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
and municipalities then that's where
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
they should go
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
if it's only 15 then that's where the 15
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
should go maybe it should be 0
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the entire hundred percent is
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
therefore applied for through a
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
non-onerous process to get the monies
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
they need to take care of their
 
01:39:04.719 --> 01:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
they need to take care of their
population

01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
population
so

01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
my question i guess is is there a way
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we can get a handle on that and is
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
it unreasonable to consider
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
not a percentage number of 15 30 or even
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
quite drastically even zero percent and
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
say it's all up for grabs based on need
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
a non-onerous
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
method by which we can allocate the
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
funds so
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
to me you put the resources where they
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
are needed most not based on this
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
artificial number that is picked out of
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
the air but really based on real data
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
real understanding real need thank you
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murphy
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i had sort of a different thought uh
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that is i wonder whether we
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't build into the legislation
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a look back
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
period of time after five years
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
that the commission and others will meet
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
and see whether there needs to be a
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
reallocation just build in two or three
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
sentences that call for
 
01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.750 align:start position:0%
sentences that call for
uh

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
a look back
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
fairly early on 18 years is a long long
 
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
fairly early on 18 years is a long long
time

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
try to imagine
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
what the problems might be
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
in this whole area
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to be beating the drug
 
01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:25.430 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to be beating the drug
problems

01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.030 align:start position:0%
problems
and

01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's very hard i think to determine need
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
i sent out
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
something to all committee members that
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
talked about unh extension
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
working with elderly people around the
 
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
working with elderly people around the
state

01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
who are addicted to drugs who had been
 
01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
who are addicted to drugs who had been
originally

01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed drugs and we know this money
 
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
prescribed drugs and we know this money
comes

01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
comes
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
from ill from prescriptions that were
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
not necessary
 
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.990 align:start position:0%
not necessary
overblown

01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
by medical personnel
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
and so that's a group that we should be
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
former police chief morenzie talks about
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
child care we have incredible numbers of
 
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.149 align:start position:0%
child care we have incredible numbers of
needs

01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
but i think if we could put in a
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
five-year look back
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
it would give us a chance not to feel
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
making a forever decision
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
about allocation for 18 years i i do
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
think that's unreasonable
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
if we're slightly wrong
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
for the first five years on percentages
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that isn't the very worst thing
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to get that money out
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
as best we can with the knowledge we now
 
01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.470 align:start position:0%
as best we can with the knowledge we now
have

01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then look back after five years and
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
see how it's working
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker um
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 126
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
kind of talks about that it tells that
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
the commission has to every year in
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
november put out a report
 
01:42:03.199 --> 01:42:06.070 align:start position:0%
november put out a report
on

01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the whole bet
 
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.070 align:start position:0%
in the whole bet
and

01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:10.790 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.590 align:start position:0%
i
think

01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to look at those
 
01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to look at those
things

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
i would ex
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
expect that the full committee
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
look at these rsas 126 83 84 85 and 86
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
and that tells how the commission was
 
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
and that tells how the commission was
formed

01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
formed
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
what their duties are
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
the members on the commission
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
and what their
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
besides the duties uh
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
reporting and that
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
and so that we're better educated on
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
because if we just look at this bill we
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
what's been put in
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
what's happened and why it was created
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
it was effective in
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
july 1
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
of 2020
so

01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's new
 
01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
it's new
and

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a wonderful idea so it's in
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
that section that perhaps we should say
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
the commission in the year
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
2028 must
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
read all its reports and
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
see whether the allocations are suitable
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
some simple sentence like that
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
with whatever year people think is
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable i think would give an
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to re-juggle
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
based on experience
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
just reporting
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of reports and i read the
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
state parks report every year and i
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
imagine i'm one of 10 people other than
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
state employees who do
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
so reporting is
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
not useful to me unless it also gives
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
a chance to make a change because of
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
what the report is saying
 
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.629 align:start position:0%
what the report is saying
okay

01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to ask the general
 
01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to ask the general
cheshire

01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
cheshire
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
from jessar county
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
so you you were involved in the
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
beginning of this
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct it sounds like the word went out
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
did the word go out to all obviously all
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
but did the word go out to all the
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
various municipalities if they wanted to
 
01:44:31.119 --> 01:44:32.390 align:start position:0%
various municipalities if they wanted to
join

01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
join
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the lawsuit that would that's my
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
understanding yes right
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
i i i don't know i can only
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
focus on the counties but that's what i
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
was told at the time and that's why
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
other towns
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
or cities stepped up and joined at that
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
point right okay
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
if anybody in the committee knows the
 
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.430 align:start position:0%
if anybody in the committee knows the
answer

01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful okay
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh very thank you thank you sir
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative abrami
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
all the uh municipalities and counties
 
01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:02.709 align:start position:0%
all the uh municipalities and counties
were

01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
told about
 
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.430 align:start position:0%
told about
this

01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.189 align:start position:0%
this
upcoming

01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
01:45:07.199 --> 01:45:08.629 align:start position:0%
upcoming
litigation

01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
and were given i believe 15 months
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
to join in on it
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
testimony by mr furland
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
and these
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
23 entities the 10 counties and 13
 
01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.470 align:start position:0%
23 entities the 10 counties and 13
municipalities

01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
they had no idea what
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
they might gain from this
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
but they felt that if they could gain
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
even something
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
that they were going to join in and
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
and see what they can accomplish with
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
this which is why
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
they thought it was important to become
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
in taking a look at this with the 13
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the 10 counties
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
we have seen data that shows again that
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
50 of the problem
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
laid in these areas
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
but that but that's what it was they
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
they were informed that there was this
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
litigation and a chance
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to get some sort of
 
01:46:18.159 --> 01:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to get some sort of
uh

01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
money from it
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
and then it's
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
they told it was any and all lawsuits
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
it seems like mckenzie was it mckenzie
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
or is it mckenzie just happened to be
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
the first case mackenzie was the first
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
settlement and they knew that there
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
would be more settlements down the road
 
01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
would be more settlements down the road
yes

01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
i haven't determined personally how i'm
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to come down on this when we vote
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
because i think there's
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
a tension between strong arguments on
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think in an ideal world representative
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
murphy put it well
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
you want to have a deliberative process
 
01:47:04.639 --> 01:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
you want to have a deliberative process
where

01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
resources can be matched most
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
effectively with needs
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
and that i'm sure without having read
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
these provisions is exactly
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
why the commission
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
has been given this task
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the long term
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're far more equipped to make
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
judicious decisions than we are as a
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee of the legislature
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
but on the other side of the coin i
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
think what's motivating the bill
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i suspect without which we wouldn't
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
have the bill
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy moves slowly
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately if we were in a
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
situation where the commission had
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
already established its rules
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
and broadcast what criteria they were
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
then i don't think that there would be a
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
cry from the counties
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.390 align:start position:0%
for a
um

01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
a short path directed amount of money
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
now i can see the mckenzie funds are
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're anxious to get their hands on
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
some and they'd like to have more than
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
as indicated by the 15 percent but with
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
a long view to what happens over the
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
course of 18 years and multiple
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
settlements which are going to be much
 
01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
settlements which are going to be much
larger

01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think representative abrami is right
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure we're going to
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
accomplish something that we'd be proud
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.159 --> 01:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
representation

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'd agree with that i
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
am much more sympathetic to the counties
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
because they do
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
cover the entire state and hopefully
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
would represent their different towns
 
01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
would represent their different towns
appropriately

01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.310 align:start position:0%
appropriately
but

01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
but
on

01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we have to be really
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
careful what we decide now
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
what what we increase
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
especially for the
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities is going to be very
 
01:49:16.239 --> 01:49:17.750 align:start position:0%
municipalities is going to be very
difficult

01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
if it seemed necessary and appropriate
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to decrease because the largest cities
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the most
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
the heaviest voting blocks in
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes i just have a question um
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
does the percentage
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
is it required by the settlement that
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
the percentage apply to all these
 
01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
the percentage apply to all these
subdivisions

01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
is it possible that for example just
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
give an example 30 apply to the counties
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
and and 15 apply to the subdivisions or
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
can it not be split out does it have to
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
be the same
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
i would defer that question to
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
north carolina is giving 60 percent to
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
their counties
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
i you know honestly speaking i haven't
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
spent a whole lot of time in this the
 
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.510 align:start position:0%
spent a whole lot of time in this the
sponsors

01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
have looked at this but what i'm hearing
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
with there seems to be a lot of angst
 
01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.350 align:start position:0%
with there seems to be a lot of angst
with

01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.629 align:start position:0%
with
these

01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
the city subdivisions
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
getting an increase
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
along with the county the goal being the
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
county gets increased a town like
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
salem that's not on this list that i
 
01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.149 align:start position:0%
salem that's not on this list that i
represent

01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know salem is part of rockingham
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
county so the rockingham so rockingham
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
county getting an increase to 30 percent
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
helped sell them but
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
salem not being on this list of
 
01:51:29.679 --> 01:51:31.669 align:start position:0%
salem not being on this list of
cities

01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:51:31.679 --> 01:51:32.629 align:start position:0%
cities
would

01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
i mean now that i'm
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i i understood the and kind of
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
agreed with the 30 now i'm starting to
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
think should it be split into counties
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
getting more
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
and these political subdivisions of
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
cities getting less
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just throwing that out there i'm not
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily making a statement that
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
represented ames
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
just uh to pick up on the
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
question that was sort of proposal made
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
by representative tucker and her
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
exchange with you the chair
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
you you pointed out the legislation
 
01:52:09.679 --> 01:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
you you pointed out the legislation
requires

01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
a report by the commissioner and just to
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
be specific that report
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
must it's a shall submit
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
an annual report which would include any
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future legislation
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a specific
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
recommend the future legislation if
 
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.629 align:start position:0%
recommend the future legislation if
the

01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of health
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
and human services sees the need for
 
01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
and human services sees the need for
that

01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
right well we're already in 2022. and if
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's an annual report then they're
 
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.430 align:start position:0%
it's an annual report then they're
behind

01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i would like to see the report
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
the lady if you were to identify
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is catherine heck i
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
represent the new hampshire municipal
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
association and i was not planning on
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
speaking today but in light of other
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought it might be
 
01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.550 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought it might be
important

01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
i had just seen the amendment and i did
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
want to add that of course our towns and
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities do partner closely with
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
our counties on many many topics so i
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
certainly i'm only here talking about
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities and to your point 13
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities did step forward and
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
joined the lawsuit early on
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
and well they were informed as you know
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
different municipalities have different
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
of different sizes have different
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to take on topics like this
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's affecting their
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
community is a little different but
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
going into a lawsuit certainly is a
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
large undertaking for a
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
for any community and i do appreciate
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
those that were forward thinking and
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
decided to get involved in the lawsuit
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
but we have many other communities that
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
are certainly affected all of our
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
communities as we know in new hampshire
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
are affected by this
 
01:54:34.639 --> 01:54:35.669 align:start position:0%
are affected by this
crisis

01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
so this is very complex legislation um
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are following what other states are
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
doing to try because they're all in the
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
same boat of trying to figure out the
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
best way to allocate these resources
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
especially given the time period and the
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
increases that we will see in the future
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
but our only concern is that we don't
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
want municipalities who have the ability
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
to to use these funds
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
to mitigate this crisis
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
to not be able to to have to compete
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
with other municipalities in the future
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
because somebody's just getting a
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know their set amounts of money so
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
we could have potentially communities
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
that did not get on the ground floor of
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
this but who will be very capable in the
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
future and willing to take on programs
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
and use these funds
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the betterment of the state so i
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to add that we don't want
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
our communities to have to compete
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
against each other for the betterment of
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
all the citizens so that's all i have
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
it should be distributed to all
 
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
it should be distributed to all
communities

01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't want them to compete
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not going to take a
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
position on that sir because i just saw
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i do apologize i we
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
just don't like to put our member you
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
know our member communities 234 towns in
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
a position where they're
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
competing against each other if they
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
have the ability and the wherewithal and
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
the want and desire to take on
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
these types of programs will everybody
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
most likely not but for the communities
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
who are affected and want to be able to
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
and use these funds and i do understand
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
that there's an ability to do so we just
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure those resources can be
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
allocated in the most equitable way to
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
have the most far-reaching
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative aaron followed by
 
01:56:34.159 --> 01:56:35.270 align:start position:0%
representative aaron followed by
representative

01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair so i have a
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
question that the
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
13 towns municipalities that joined in
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
early on this litigation
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge they already had
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
programs in place
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
to deal with the opioid issue
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they were hoping that they through
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
this litigation they may get some
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
funding to help them with those programs
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
i i cannot speak for all of the 13
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
communities my understanding is that
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they know there's a
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
need in their community i i can't speak
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
to whether or not they have programs in
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
place but they have a need in their
 
01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.070 align:start position:0%
place but they have a need in their
community

01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
to mitigate this crisis
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
so they're probably developing programs
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
if they don't already have them or wish
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
to move forward with with some type of
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
programming but i can't speak to each
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
community and what they have in place i
 
01:57:34.239 --> 01:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
community and what they have in place i
apologize

01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.470 align:start position:0%

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
turn on the microphone sorry
 
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
turn on the microphone sorry

01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
do you have an opinion on whether
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
more useful to have more funding in the
 
01:57:57.199 --> 01:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
more useful to have more funding in the
counties

01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
to bring together the small communities
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
that are not really capable of putting
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
together either a program or a proposal
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
for a program
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
on their own without being consolidated
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
anything else oh thank you for your
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
wow

01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
anything

01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
we have our work to do
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
represent nunes we'll see this again
 
01:58:42.239 --> 01:58:43.350 align:start position:0%
represent nunes we'll see this again
correct

01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.310 align:start position:0%
correct
yes

01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
and let me remind you
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
275 has been passed by the senate
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
if it does come to us
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to amend it
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
if we need to
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will come to us because
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mention the allocation
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
it'll go to health and human services or
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
finance well probably not finance either
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know where it is you may not
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
mention it but it's part of the law
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
so if you could talk to the speaker i
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
so if that if if going the route of the
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill isn't an option
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
um then maybe
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know just listening to what i heard
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
again i'll just say maybe we do come up
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that gives the
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
counties 30
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.669 align:start position:0%
and the
town

01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
cities stay with the 15
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how people feel about that
 
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:56.830 align:start position:0%
i don't know how people feel about that
if

01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
the committee was going to have to make
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
a decision on that and that's something
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
one more please sir
 
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.990 align:start position:0%
one more please sir
um

02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
because we know that we're going to see
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:00:25.119 --> 02:00:25.350 align:start position:0%
this bill
uh again

02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh again
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
i would really like to hear we've heard
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
from a couple of counties in one city in
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
the hearings that we've had so far on
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
um i would really like to hear from
 
02:00:35.679 --> 02:00:36.790 align:start position:0%
um i would really like to hear from
others

02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
how is there a way that we can send
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
invites out to
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
any of them to to come in and talk about
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
about the bill or talk about the
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
situations that they're going through
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
or is that just
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
extending this to too much
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
time schedule
 
02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
time schedule
that

02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
from my notes here
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
we need to get the
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee reports if they exist
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
robson aaron
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
to uh representative nunes question
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
we've been requesting
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities to come
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
to our work sessions and and also to the
 
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.589 align:start position:0%
to our work sessions and and also to the
hearing

02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
but they've been all busy with um
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
getting ready for town meeting and doing
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
budgets so it's been hard to get people
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
to come up to concord that's all i
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.679 --> 02:01:44.709 align:start position:0%

02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative murphy my friend
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
the one word that rang with me is
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
onerous onerous
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
the award you used was honorous
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
non-honors it has to be an on
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
non-onerous process
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
at the state
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
it makes me shiver a little bit because
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i can see
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
by

02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
region by
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
special interest by whatever
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why i mean i'm sure they're
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
all well
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
they had the heart in the right place
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
and all but
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's why i part of me
 
02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
that's why i part of me
says

02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
why don't we
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear that north carolina
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
was in north carolina allocated 60 of
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
their counties
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
because the county's a nimble more
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
nimble than i think this commission
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm i've been i mean i
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
thought about this for the last couple
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
of weeks
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
that that maybe it's better to try to
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
give some more money to the to the
 
02:03:00.159 --> 02:03:01.510 align:start position:0%
give some more money to the to the
counties

02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then then
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the remainder of that money and
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be a lot of money
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
to really like laser
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
fund from the state
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
to points of of need um
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
without and then the counties will feel
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
more comfortable knowing that at least
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
they've got a reasonable allocation
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
and it's probably going to be more money
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
than they ever thought would come their
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
way because some of these settlements
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be really large
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
so i i i would advocate for for that and
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
i i think first round i think these
 
02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
i i think first round i think these
these

02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:36.790 align:start position:0%
these
13

02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
13
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay they're expecting something so okay
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
we'll give them the 15
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
but they're going to get more if we give
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
more to the counties as well it's going
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
to back it's going to backfill to them
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe that's the solution but i
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
think and that's just pat's speaking
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
here but
 
02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.149 align:start position:0%
here but
i

02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think we you know if even even if the
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
the state went up with 40 50
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
this they can they can laser focus where
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
that money should go
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
but we're going to guarantee
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
that all the communities all the
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
counties get a reasonable allocation
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
to work programs that most of them
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
already have they all have county jails
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
we know that and we know that a lot of
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
the the problems wind up in the county
 
02:04:20.550 --> 02:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
jails and i know in rockingham we're
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
working on programs to work with those
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
those people
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh because the a lot of the those that
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
are addicted
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
wind up in general and rocky him are
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
going why are we doing something with
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
with with we
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
we don't want them in the jail and so
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're creating outpatient programs
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
to keep them out of jail but they have
 
02:04:38.719 --> 02:04:39.910 align:start position:0%
to keep them out of jail but they have
to

02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
sign up for this program where we'll be
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
treating their their addictions
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i mean the counties are set up for
 
02:04:45.599 --> 02:04:46.629 align:start position:0%
and i mean the counties are set up for
this

02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
um and and again and they represent all
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
the communities i mean all the towns
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
around me are too small to do any of
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
this and we have to look to the next
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
biggest entity
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
is the county so
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
so i that's my and again i haven't been
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
involved with this bill
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
but uh i think if we're going to do
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
something let's let's increase the the
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
county allocation
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
keep the cat towns and then deal with
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
the towns later on
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
if we want to reduce what those original
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
towns get because
 
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.910 align:start position:0%
towns get because
um

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
and that that's those my final comments
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have a an idea
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
who represented melanie i don't know
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
since you've read the statute better
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
than i did at this point
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
on i was told by senator rosenwald
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
that one of the places that they would
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
be spending
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
money probably would be
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
on applications from non-profits that
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
are working in this area
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and they would be besides the counties
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
the only place that would be going
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
across all the small towns that aren't
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pull themselves
 
02:05:55.199 --> 02:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pull themselves
together

02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
so it'd be good to
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
verify whether that's in the law or
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
can

02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
can you check with
 
02:06:08.239 --> 02:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
can you check with
representative

02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.390 align:start position:0%
representative
rosenthal

02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
rosenthal
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
i can
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
i can read the statute
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the four parts and see thanks
 
02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
the the four parts and see thanks
uh

02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to forget
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
the county has the jail
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
it has to deal with all the all those
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
things and it also works with all these
 
02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
things and it also works with all these
non-profits

02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
but there's something that's every
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
community is involved with
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that's the
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
their emts and
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
ambulances they all have that
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the first
 
02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.430 align:start position:0%
and the first
problem

02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
is going to involve emt and an ambulance
 
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
and all that so
 
02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
and all that so
um

02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
if we give it all to the counties
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
for them we might want to
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
think about that if we make these
 
02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:10.069 align:start position:0%
think about that if we make these
decisions

02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i just wanted to make you
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
aware that um i'd be happy to work on
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
any refinements uh and come up with
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
another amendment that would be amenable
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
to everybody thank
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman would it be appropriate to
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
kind of get the feel of the committee
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
and see through a straw poll whether
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
people kind of agree with something like
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
a 30 percent
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
to counties and 15 percent to the city's
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
slash towns
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
would that help we could do that
 
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:49.669 align:start position:0%
would that help we could do that
yes

02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
but what i want
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
everybody to do
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
is go to rsa 126
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
83 84 85 and 86 read those there's not
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
an awful lot it tells exactly what the
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to do
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:07.030 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to do
and

02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the split up of the funds and all
 
02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
and the split up of the funds and all
that

02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
that
sorry

02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we make any changes it's going to
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
affect that
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it's good that we do because
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
it'll affect that too
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
because if we pass senate bill 275 as is
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
do that and then we'll take us we can
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
take a straw poll
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
at our next meeting even though
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be dealing with something else
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
so your homework is
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
go through that those
 
02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
go through that those
statues

02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.709 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
senator was head of the emts in the
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
department of safety for quite a while
 
02:09:10.239 --> 02:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
department of safety for quite a while
on

02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
and she
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask her
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
with to find out whether under the laws
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
that exists
 
02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:22.390 align:start position:0%
that exists
on

02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
they could send money
 
02:09:25.119 --> 02:09:26.310 align:start position:0%
they could send money
to

02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
a part of the state which
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
is forbidden for general funds but to a
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
part of the state namely that agency
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
within the department of safety to
 
02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
within the department of safety to
distribute

02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:38.950 align:start position:0%
distribute
across

02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
the emts in the state
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
on and i think if anybody else had
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
connections like that to try to figure
 
02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.629 align:start position:0%
connections like that to try to figure
out

02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
whether that part of this could come out
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the general money
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
that would then go to all of the small
 
02:09:57.119 --> 02:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
that would then go to all of the small
towns

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think that the small towns are really
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to think about in such a
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
in response to the questions that have
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
been raised about the
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
scope of the
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
ability of the commission to distribute
 
02:10:27.679 --> 02:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
ability of the commission to distribute
funds

02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
question mark to nonprofits
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
or to these other statewide programs i
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
see no restrictions
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i think the the authority is to fund
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
projects and
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the word projects is used
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's broad and i haven't read
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
that are pending that are about to be
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
approved and perhaps the commission
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
picked it up in the rules but i believe
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
they have the authority
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
to establish a
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
far-reaching system that
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
would certainly pick up the obvious
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
places to send money to
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm sure well i would expect that
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are part of that grants to
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and a contract
 
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:22.229 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and a contract
to

02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
go forward with
 
02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
go forward with
whatever

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll have jennifer check
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
see if there's been any reports
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
and then if there are
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
distributed to the committee members and
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
and the rules get the rules themselves
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and the rules
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.119 --> 02:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
good
excellent

02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
you've got your homework to do on these
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
four bills
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
shortly

02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i printed them out
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%

remember
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
when we deal with these five bills is
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
strictly the revenue and funds
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%

02:13:43.040 --> 02:14:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
is
