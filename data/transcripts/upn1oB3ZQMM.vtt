00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm opening the subcommittee uh
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
work session on uh House Bill
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
1410 and first I want to want to say is
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh we've got two bills amendments uh for
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
each of them and we have a hard stop at
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
10 um and they're supposed to be exec
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
later today so we really need to come to
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
a decision on these um um promptly so
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
this 1410 is the one that um you know
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
we've met a couple times on and uh
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
nitpick through all the different
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
changes and I got an amendment on ofs
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
that combines everything and I didn't
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
get it till last night so for sorry for
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
not sending it earlier and I went
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
through it carefully and hopefully and
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
verified to my satisfaction um that it
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
reflects what we asked for but um so
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do reasonably briefly
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
and leave more time for 1676 is if
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
people have if can look through the
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you've got any um
 
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you've got any um
questions

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
concerns 1410 we're starting with yeah
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
you want to cop you want to copy the
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
right these will be your copies that too
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
as um and I don't know how people want
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
to proceed um the this amendment
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
Bill and and um I can walk through it or
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
people would like to just look at it um
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
know be easier just quickly sorry
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
quickly walk through it yeah
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay I'll do that
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the notes I took um so
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
we decided on section one which was the
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of the LNA licensing that
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
we were going to keep
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
and so um section what used to be
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
section one is left out of the bill
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
entirely as well as some repeals later
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
on which we'll get to um we decided on
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
section two it was more this is the
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
nurse Practice Act Board of
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
Nursing um we we left out see Pages 8
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
through 15 yeah the whole thing about
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
changing the makeup of the board we
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
decided to keep what's in statute now
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that was um section you know Roman
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh 1 of uh 326 B3 and if you look at the
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
top of the amendment it starts with um
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
with Roman two so it leaves one out and
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
and so it it does what we
 
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
and so it it does what we
wanted

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
um um correct correct and that means it
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
stays as is correct stat right and then
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing we done in section
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
two is we removed the original lines 21
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
on page one through um actually went on
 
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:46.340 align:start position:0%
quite a
 
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
quite a
[Music]

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
what is shorter from
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
establish eligibility criteria for
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
license or something I don't I'm trying
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
to look at what is missing what was
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
struck line 15 of the
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
um that's the language that's the
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill was on
 
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.789 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill was on
page

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
two um on lines uh 28 through
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
30 that we had decided to
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.909 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
um section two page one a huge chunk
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
right there's a huge chunk that we
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
decided to take out of the
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
bill and so we took out
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.590 align:start position:0%
bill and so we took out
um

00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.750 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
actually yeah we actually removed where
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
are we here we basically took out all
 
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.789 align:start position:0%
are we here we basically took out all
the

00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
Chang right we took that out
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
definitely and
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
then so that keeps it so because we took
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
that out of the bill that stays as is
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
right because the the board was being
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
changed largely to accommodate removing
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
um the LNA licensing but corre decided
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
to keep it so um M right along yeah
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
moving right along one of the things uh
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
you might notice and I mentioned this to
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative mapi is in the
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
original bill on page 2 13-
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
22 there are some lines that were struck
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
out and uh what OS cleverly decided to
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
do instead of doing it that way they
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
added in the repeal
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
section on on page four of the amendment
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
on line 15
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're repealing 326 B3 uh sections
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
Roman 9 through Roman 11 which are those
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
so instead of reproducing them in the
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
bill and striking them out they uh they
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
just did it that way so that's fine
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
page of the of
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
the um is that you well I was just
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
looking for that particular you're just
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
line 15 yeah right yeah but the RSS
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
don't matter up hang on one second
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
what's your concern the r the line 15 in
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the amendment on page
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh page four
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's saying that we removed
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
everything in that big block of the
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
original um let me see corre okay if
 
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.669 align:start position:0%
original um let me see corre okay if
[Music]

00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
you but it doesn't
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
consider the ones that were here in the
 
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:03.930 align:start position:0%
original Bill RSA 4 colon
 
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.029 align:start position:0%
original Bill RSA 4 colon
[Music]

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
one which the I mean what this is effect
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the original bill you
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
look at page one line 7 that's 326 B3
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is the same section and then if
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
you look down through that section and
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
you get to the next page starting at
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
line 13 that's still 326 B3 13- 22
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
and those are sections Roman 9 through
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
11 and the on the amendment on p on line
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
15 of page four it's um it's repealing
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
those sections I I get it so that I'm
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with RSA 326
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
co-b colon 4 that corresponds to the
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
line on page one but there are two other
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
rsay the provisions of r RSA 4 colon one
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
controlling the removal of public
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
officials um that one and then RSA 91
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the pages on and lines
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
on the original bill yeah it's on page
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
two in the three sections that was
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
struck line line number okay line number
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
16 13 line number 21 in page two hang on
 
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
line 16 yeah that's in the that's in the
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
middle of that section 13 22 correct and
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
and line
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
21 no mention of it in the amendment
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
actually that's not true so in the
 
00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:41.149 align:start position:0%
actually that's not true so in the
original

00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
bill they put them there and then Drew
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
lines through them to remove them right
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
if the lines strike through that means
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's being removed from statute but they
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
did it in the amendment in a different
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
way um on page four of the amendment on
 
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
way um on page four of the amendment on
line

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
15 it repeals s 326 B3 Roman 9 through
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
11 which are those sections with the
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
strike through so instead of printing
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
them here and doing a strike through
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
they just repeal the sections and it has
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
effect but that section is not refer in
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment anywhere not true is my
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
question that is not true it because the
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
on on page four of the amendment line 15
 
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.190 align:start position:0%
on on page four of the amendment line 15
it's

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
toxi which are Romans
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
9-1 and those and if you look at the
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
original bill on page two starting line
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
13 those are the three sections Roman
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
910 and 11 that the bill removed by
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
doing a strike through whereas the
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
amendment removes them by just
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly listing the SE the
 
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
explicitly listing the SE the
subsections

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
subsections
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah
 
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.390 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah
okay

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
um so there's that and then if we go
 
00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
um so there's that and then if we go
back

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
yeah it's confusing I spent a while last
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
night trying to yeah that's why thinking
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
these two are not referred in yeah they
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
are actually they explicitly are this
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
are actually they explicitly are this
one

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
could I I'm just yeah it's
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
not this
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
is they got clever oh that's got clever
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
and just did it
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
which is B yeah it's there okay
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for all
 
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.789 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for all
right

00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
um okay so that
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
was and then we left the rest of we
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
voted to leave the rest of section to in
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
did and then
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
I just want one
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
clarification on this one Y which
 
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
clarification on this one Y which
we

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
repealed we agreed um the original Bill
 
00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:14.110 align:start position:0%
repealed we agreed um the original Bill
page

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
page
six

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh 22 23
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
24 U I'm sorry what page uh the original
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
Bill Page 6 22 23
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
24 yeah
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
and keep the repeal could could before
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
we get to page six can we go back and
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
keep working through this in order
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
because we were kind of on page or did
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
you get that far I don't think we got
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
that far no no well the reason I'm
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
saying is the repeal section it kind of
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
corresponds with okay the amendment
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
corresponds with number 10 on page six
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
to number four on
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment right um no I understand but
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
we did are we okay we went through page
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
three and four of the original and made
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
sure the amendment lined up with what we
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do before we jump to page six
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
okay that's all I'm asking okay yeah
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
think everybody's trying to keep on
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
track in their own
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
way um all right so the original Bill
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
section three page
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
two uh lines
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
203 through Page Three line 20 and
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's the nurse practice we
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
already powers and duties of the board
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
so this we uh said we wanted
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
to leave it as is and and that's all
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
right the amendment
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
line through page two line 11 on the
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
amendment no the Amendment it can't be
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
page one you mean um line nine actually
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
right on page
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
one yeah line
 
00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.510 align:start position:0%
one yeah line
n

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
n
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah original s section two of that and
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
that continues to page two line 11 and
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
that is basic it's the
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
same I look through that and it is the
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
same so now we're up to of the um of the
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill let me go to the next page so
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
we did that and now there was uh the
 
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
we did that and now there was uh the
original

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
original
section

section
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
four and the original section 4 we
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to remove that section from the
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill that's what we voted on and that
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
starts on page three line 21 of the
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
that yeah we said to keep that that's
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
the one where on this copy I didn't um
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's where there was a
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
change sry where is it on the amendment
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's on uh page two of the amendment
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
starting at
 
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.269 align:start position:0%
starting at
line

00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
12 is that yeah starting at line 12 okay
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
same sorry I put mic on yeah on page
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
four of the of the original yeah line 2
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
4 to 28 was where there was a an an
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
addition and that stays the same and
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's where we want it to be right um
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
right that's right that's in the
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
amendment it's page three on lines 14
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
through 18 cor corre so they just
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
reproduce that whole section of the book
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that's because that's a federal
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
registry right we want we want to refer
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
to it yeah
 
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
um the um and then okay chair yeah I
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
have a a question in that yeah um how
 
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
does so that has to come in a SE LNA
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
licensing and registration that's a
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
separate bill so we're not dealing with
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
it we are just keeping it in the statute
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
the way and it'll be addressed in a
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
separate bill um if if you could come up
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh Doug as I recall you said that this
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
was included because there's some reason
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
to to put this reference in there but it
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't as I recall Mr chair if I may as
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
I recall
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
um director Courtney thought that she
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
could handle the LNA issues through
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
policy and procedure that was the uh the
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
fees and getting the money but that's
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
separate from what's in this go no my
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
understanding just to back up what uh
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative I'm yeah I'm going to
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
really insist on moving along because we
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
have a hard stop
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
so Point me where you want me yeah this
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
was on uh the um the the amend on the
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
original Bill page 4 24 through 28 which
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
is adding the reference to 42
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
CFR oh yeah um we're gonna be doing that
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
regardless okay so this is just putting
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
in there what you're doing anyway yeah
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
okay it's just so people understand
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
right but it's not really changing
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
anything correct else okay thank you all
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
right I'd like to move on to in the
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh section five page four
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:30.070 align:start position:0%
starting at line
29

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
29
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
um page four line I'm sorry section five
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
page four line 29 um there were um two
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
changes to the or three changes the uh
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
criminal history check for nurse
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
Practice Act the first one was put in
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
there because we were going to remove
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
nurse PR I mean
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
lnas and and so that's no longer needed
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
since we're keeping lnas there were two
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
other changes which were uh reflecting
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that we gave certain Authority
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
on feem making and other things uh you
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
know to oplc rather than the board and
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
those remain and so if you look at the
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment page
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
three um starting at line
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
19 um through 25 that's it keeps those
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
changes and gets rid of the one that we
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't need anymore that's correct as we
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
wanted it right right and then page six
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.509 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
um

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.310 align:start position:0%
 
six

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
25 I'm trying to get things lined up oh
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at so
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's page four on Amendment uh page
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
four right starting at
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
line we got through I'm trying to get
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
lined up again um so we got through the
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
Section Five of the original bill which
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
is now section four section six of the
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill oh the other thing if you
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
look on the amendment there on uh page
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
three line 24 there's an a new section
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that was um actually recommended by
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
by Mr uster house and it's another case
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
you know we're it's language cleanup
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
because the fees are no longer with the
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
board they're with oplc um and so that's
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh there okay so now we're on
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
to was that only for I thought that was
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
only for Ln not well it was done for
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
everything but this one there was one
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
was because the nurses Nurse
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
Practitioners they pay their dues or the
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
employ what we did is all board I mean
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
for all the boards we said the boards no
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
longer set the fees oplc sets the fees
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
for everything but this one we missed
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
and it still gave uh it said the fees
 
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519 align:start position:0%
are established by the board so as part
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the rest of this we're taking as
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
established by the board out
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
because op oplc sets all fees now and
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
the problem is we gave the authority
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
oplc but there's some lingering things
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
where we left it with the boards and
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's a conflict in statute see that
 
00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:40.909 align:start position:0%
that's a conflict in statute see that
okay

00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay I see the head nodding yes okay and
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
then um so with that um you know I just
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
want to go back to the lines in the
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
original Bill the repeal which page six
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
22 23 24 the medical technicians yes and
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
and in the amendment page 4 1213 and
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
14 which is to be remove I mean repealed
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the board but
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
where is the Safeguard to say who has
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
the authority the
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
employer um we're I mean that's
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
generally the employer is liable for
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
what their employees do we don't need to
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
say that okay um so we we kept those
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
repeals there so that that does give OPC
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
or the employer I just want the
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah yeah Doug Mr I would
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
say the employer but then also if the
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
individual is licensed under an under
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
another board uh that board would also
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction so where would it Go
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
which board would it go to if it was a
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
nurse it go to nursing if it was go to
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
medicine right so the definition of
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
medical technician as far as this bill
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
goes excludes anyone that's licensed for
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
anything else and they're dealt with as
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
they are today it doesn't change
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
anything right so they're under some
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
other board yeah okay thank you no okay
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
no they're not under any well the
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
technicians aren't but if you but any
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
other person who's licens is under their
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
board medical technicians aren't
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
licensed and you know and that's
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
like you know housekeeping various other
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
things which are not licensed
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
professions but they work in the
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
hospital and they're under the employers
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
you know say under the like a j i mean
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
if a janitor in any company goes and
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
harms let's say a customer well then the
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
company's liable so that's generally
 
00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:40.069 align:start position:0%
company's liable so that's generally
true

00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
um we need to move on seriously um sorry
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
about that but we really really do
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
because we have a hard stop so if we
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
um in the original Bill section six
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
um right so that makes a change because
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
we were going the bill was going to get
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
rid of lure it makes changes from lure
 
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
rid of lure it makes changes from lure
to

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
registration um and and the since we
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
decided to keep it this whole section uh
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
goes away and it's not in the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
amendment they not all section uh the
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
original Bill page four line 35 okay and
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
that goes on to page five line
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
35 and so all of that is gone which is
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we voted to
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
do okay and then um the original section
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
s which is page five line 36 in the
 
00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:44.510 align:start position:0%
s which is page five line 36 in the
original

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
original
bill

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
um right um that hasn't changed and in
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
six starts at at right or line 26 sorry
 
00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:08.270 align:start position:0%
six starts at at right or line 26 sorry
uh

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
yes okay and then um and that's
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
correct right and then if we look at the
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
original page six line five and that's
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
the Section 8 yep and Section 8 we
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave the section of the bill
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
as is which they did
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
then uh yep that's correct right at page
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
three line S and that goes into the next
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
page and then in the original bill um on
 
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.230 align:start position:0%
page and then in the original bill um on
line

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
18 it was
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
um it's you know which which uh boards
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
that oplc has Authority for and since we
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
got rid of of the medical technician
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
registration um we're still taking out
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
on on page four line 8 of the amendment
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
it still references
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
328i but the reference to 328j which was
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
the nurse practitioners was taken out
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
because we're going to retain the
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
license for nurse
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners right okay
 
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
practitioners right okay
y

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
y
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm going to go quickly
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
through the last you know it was 10 now
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
nine because we're we really need to get
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
to the next bill the first three as you
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
had mentioned are still related to the
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
medical technicians and that chain that
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
stays um line 15 on page four is the one
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
we talked about where it keeps those
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
line the lines are removed that were
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
removed in the original Bill and then
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of these are
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
um let's see so lines 16 and 17 on page
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
four of the amendment are more things
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
where the the statute was in Conflict
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's things that had moved to oplc but
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
that was not reflected in the board
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
statute right um that was right we
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
those those are lines 27 and 28 on the
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
original bill right right and
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
um and okay we left in um license or
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
application because that was for the
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
lnas we're keeping the LNA Li
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
that had to stay um can we just look at
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
one that uh is all I mean the original
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
Bill line page
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
629 in my note says remove this line at
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
separate section to keep it so and where
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
is that corresponding that is relative
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
to licensed that section is um oh it's I
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned it earlier relative to license
 
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.349 align:start position:0%
mentioned it earlier relative to license
or

00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
application yeah the one we added
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
which somebody else can quickly remember
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
where it was but we just mentioned
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
it yeah if we can continue um
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
sorry and um it's it's a I think page
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
three line 24 um no yes no no no no
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
not that
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
one if somebody finds it you can mention
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
it but I'm going to move on yep um so on
 
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
it but I'm going to move on yep um so on
the

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
the
Amendment

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh line 18 licensure by
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
endorsement for lnas we're taking we're
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
keeping we're keeping that repeal
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
because there's separate statute on
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
license by endorsement that we passed
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
last year and renewal and licens re
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
instatement we're removing those because
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
again those are under oplc not the
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
board and that's the end of
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
it yeah and we have just over 20 minutes
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
left for another whole bill so I would
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
like if somebody make a
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
motion uh I will make a
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on House Bill
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
1410 and as soon as I get organized here
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the subcommittee work
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1676 and this we
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
have to be very brief um I apologize for
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that but we have a hard stop in 20
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'll just quickly go over
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
what I did here the statement of purpose
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
is just what we discussed and voted on
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
on a previous uh subcommittee
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
meeting um and then you know the changes
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
to the membership of the board which is
 
00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:19.950 align:start position:0%
to the membership of the board which is
on

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
um you know it's the membership starts
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
on line 22 of page one of the
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.829 align:start position:0%
on line 22 of page one of the
amendment

00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
is is you know it's what I handed out
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
basically um it be you know two members
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
of Edna one from the minority Party U
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker one member of
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
House consumer affairs appointed by the
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
speaker same thing for the Senate
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
President um public member representing
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
the interest of business in New
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire appointed by the Bia and I
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
checked with uh leadership in the Bia
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and they're fine with that which I
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
would expect but they were um uh
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc or her design
 
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.790 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc or her design
I'm

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
wondering um two members of the public
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor with consent
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the council and one public member
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
representing Healthcare employers
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the government with consent
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
of the council and that one I mean
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
there's been various ideas on
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
organizations they should come from
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association or whatever the
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
problem is from as far as I could tell
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's not one overarching group that
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
that represents all the healthcare
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
workers so I'm leaving it that way um
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it says it's the same language that
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have in all the boards public members
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
can't hold a license or be a spouse of
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
them um that that and legislative
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
members get mileage so we're on page two
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
and now we're and and the part that was
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the original bill which is um you
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
know the things for the um the duties of
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
board for them to compare and there's no
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
um you know nothing should be read into
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
the order here they're all there list of
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
things and there's an or at the end so
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
they can do any of
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
them um and is it they have to do any of
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
them or all of them no any there's an or
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
so they can pick up few of those and not
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
do the whole less or or well it's a
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
matter of these are the options okay you
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
know what are these are the thing
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
actually this one is in these are the
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
things they should consider but it
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell them what their conclusion
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
has to
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
be they should look at these
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
options and maybe they will look at some
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
of them very briefly because they don't
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
think they make any sense and that's
 
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.270 align:start position:0%
think they make any sense and that's
fine

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
May right it says may include so it's
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
not requiring them to do any of them
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
actually but it's it's suggesting those
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
are things they might want to consider
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for that I like the fact
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a deadline Sunset
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
all those things to hold commission yeah
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
I was going to get that
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
basically um you know well I had my view
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
is to having the repeals might help get
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
something done I'm not sure how
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
effective that would be anyway um
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
because they could get around it just by
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the repeals and it
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
generated a lot I mean people perceived
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
it differently than me which I
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
understand and uh and so it seemed best
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
to take that whole thing out of there
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
which I did and then uh again from the
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
original bill um you know there's the
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
rest on page three of six through um
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually you know down to
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
24 which are things they could do and if
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
you look at um section seven starting
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
line six there's a list of things and
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
again I suggest not reading anything
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
into the order and that's got an or on
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
lines 15 which says they can do any of
 
00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:47.559 align:start position:0%
them and the last one is make no change
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
to state law so they're you know it's
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
just telling them what to what to look
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
at doing and decide what they think is
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
best and I don't you know the bill
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't control that it's going to be up
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
to the commission and it says the
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
commission Also may comment on each
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
licensing board's composition like we've
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed compositions of boards and the
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
authority of the law delegates to
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
promate administrative
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
rules um and particularly rules relating
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
to establish a scope of practice and the
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications to gain a license and
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
those are you know two of the key rul
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
making areas that boards are involved in
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
and then some other things they can
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
comment on but they may comment on Le
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
these things for them to think about as
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
the idea in section
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
nine and then there's already in statute
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
a thing where you know unless the the um
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
the bill creating the commission States
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise all commissions automatically
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
expire after five years but in uh
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
discussion with chair Maguire she
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
suggested adding it here explicitly
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
which in section three lines 25 and 26
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
where sorry if you lost me uh if you
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
look at line 25 and 26 prospective
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
repeal it says relative to evaluate
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
various occupational boards and
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
commissions and to recommend needed
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
changes is repealed and if you look at
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
the effective date section it says
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
section three of this act will take
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
effect December the 31st 2029 which is
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
the five years oh that's okay I get it
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very convoluted way to
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
say that but I ol I just told them to
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
have it repeal after 5 years and this is
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
how all US did it
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
so you know my on this is I still feel
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is a little premature having just
 
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:41.079 align:start position:0%
implemented this major change last year
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
which hasn't been implemented this is
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
not statutary commission or committees
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
it is the regulatory boards in the
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
commission or committee this is looking
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
at all the licensing 16 76 what
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan is looking at is
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
all the other commissions outside I mean
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
if if his commission were to be
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
recreated or continued it would look at
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
the commission created by this not not
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
the licensing board correct and correct
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I hope that won't be necessary
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
because it auto repeals So to avoid that
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
I mean I just I I I understand your
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
concern what I would say is
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the big changes we
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
made um last year and some this year
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
were you know some changes in oplc
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
giving them additional Authority and all
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
of that but the basic functions of the
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
boards I we made there's some bills to
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
change some of them but the basic
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
functions of boards which are you know
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
the rulle making around what are the
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
requirements to be licensed and what's
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice and and other
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
things like that for most of the boards
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change and there's nothing
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
in here that tells the commission what
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
what order they have to take the boards
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
in I mean they can take start with the
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
boards that are have changed the least
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
or more stable and look them over and
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they're going to decide that maybe
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
there's some minor changes needed maybe
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
nothing um that would be up to the
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
commission um and you know they can
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
leave the ones that maybe there's been
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
more significant changes to later it's
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
over five years so that's why I'm not
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
concerned representative G thank you Mr
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
chair my question is going along with
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
this theme and not wanting to just keep
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
creating new commissions and committees
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessary isn't there
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
already an oplc commission or committee
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
looking at oplc and how is this
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
different and why is it needed there is
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
an oplc oversight committee which uh I
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
and chair Maguire are on
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and it's only had a couple meetings so
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
it's be you know it's not entirely clear
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
how it's going to work but what it looks
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
like is looking at current issues that
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
have come up uh but it's not set up and
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's not going to be
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking a deep dive
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
into um you know the the statutes and
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the rules of each individual board so
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's not going to do this it's been
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
more um you know getting uh director
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
Courtney or someone to report on how
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
rule Mak is going on some of the things
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
we did last year and um you know getting
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by people who are
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
licensed and then you know talking to
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
people at opl having people at oplc talk
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
to the committee about you know what
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
what why what's going on with that and
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of an ongoing keeping an
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
eye on them and trying to um learn of
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
problems early on and hopefully deal
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
with them promptly and not have concern
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know in the licensed Community or or
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
in consumers either one build up okay so
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
um what I'm hearing is that oversight
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
committee is uh looking at the process
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
the procedural work of oplc where this
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
commission would be analyzing the boards
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
and and making recommendations correct I
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
mean there's nothing to prevent the
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee from looking at the
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
statute and rules uh but it it's not
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of not really their charge
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
to do that it's more ongoing things and
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
looking at how I mean the chair is
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and looking at how she's
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
um choosing to run the committee it's
 
00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:26.710 align:start position:0%
um choosing to run the committee it's
more

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
um uh looking at concerns people have
 
00:50:29.319 --> 00:50:30.270 align:start position:0%
um uh looking at concerns people have
about

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
oplc um and um you know keeping up with
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
how they're implementing the statutory
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
changes that have gone into place over
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
the last you last year this year
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
represent man yeah isn't the role of the
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
board to evaluate the current situation
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
market and the profession and Licensing
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce issue all those things are
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
inh apparently the
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
board the licensing board part of it is
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
there you would you would hope so uh but
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know the authority over
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
licensing and what the boards are doing
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
is with the legislature and this is a
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
commission made up majority as required
 
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.109 align:start position:0%
commission made up majority as required
of

00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislators um you'd like to think the
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
board was doing that but I mean we've
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
seen cases where that doesn't seem to be
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
the case now there are the other
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
question raised at one time was a
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
performance audits what performance
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
Audits and they're good but they're like
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
the one we have with the Dental Board
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
and the Mental Health Board the last
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
while they're looking at is the board um
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
following statute are they doing what
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature told them to do and are
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
they doing it in an efficient manner and
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing but it but
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's not their job to say you know is
 
00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:49.150 align:start position:0%
it's not their job to say you know is
the

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
statute um correct because that's what
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature and it's also it's only
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
their job to look at the rules to the
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
extent do the rules correspond to what
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the authority given in statute um and
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
and are they you know leading them to
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
operate in an efficient manner um and so
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's an important job but it's a
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
different job than than I think this
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
Commission job would be okay uh
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair um I in my mind I think the the
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment here we've come to a good
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
balance between where we started with
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
the concerns about sunsetting
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
commissions without any guarantee
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
that uh sunsetting boards excuse me
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
without any guarantee that the
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
commission would do any work I think
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
we've solved that and I think it remains
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
in place for those that have a little
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
bit of a concern about the maybe the
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
overbearing nature of of board
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
regulations so I think that this strikes
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
a really good balance between the
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
concerns on both sides of the table all
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
you um I I'm going to move forward I'm
 
00:52:58.789 --> 00:52:58.799 align:start position:0%
not not taken I mean is anybody else
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
who's on the subcommittee have anything
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
to say and then I think we need to go to
 
00:53:02.839 --> 00:53:04.990 align:start position:0%
to say and then I think we need to go to
a

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
motion um you want to would your motion
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
be at the uh it would be um to um that'
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually be two motions one is to adop
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
and actually on the other one we should
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
have done an otpa one but it's to um to
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
recommend the adoption of this amendment
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I would I would do that make a motion
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
that we vote to
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
approve the amendment to House Bill 1676
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%

hearings that I know about
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
we'll probably get second committee
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
bills but those will be after the
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
vacation week um the deadline for all
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
our other bills is March
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
21st so there's plenty of time for
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work on the bills we have
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
remaining but uh I'm going on vacation
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's the first time Edna has not had to
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
schedule things during vacation week in
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
a long
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.229 align:start position:0%
a long
time

01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
it and my plan for today is to start
 
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.270 align:start position:0%
it and my plan for today is to start
with

01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.270 align:start position:0%
with
the

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
um with the pension bills do the LI do
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
the licensing bills after lunch assuming
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
that we aren't finished before
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
lunch and finish up with the time change
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
because those those aren't early bills
 
01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:20.679 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to finish them this
 
01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to finish them this
today

01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
moves all to pass and presents Amendment
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
0326 and it should be among the pile of
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
Pap papers at everybody's place and is
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
second so that's represent
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
blackis okay do you wish to speak to
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
your motion uh yes thank thank you madam
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
chair uh so 1647 um addresses group two
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
workers um multiplier for their um
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
annual their final average compensation
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
and um the bill itself is a almost $56
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
million bill and we felt the need to
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
bring the cost down a little bit so the
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is a cost-saving measure it's
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
also potentially um a retention measure
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
and basically says that in order to get
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
the increased multiplier after their
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
their first 10 years of credible service
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
um they have to um have at least
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
attained the age of 60 regardless of the
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
number of years of credible service or
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
they have to work up to their full uh
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
age and service requirements in order to
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
get that added multiplier if they fail
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
to do one of those two things um then
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
they will keep the current multiplier
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
which is 2% instead of the
 
01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
2.5% um the other thing that the
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
amendment does uh is creates a carve
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
out um for those with uh ordinary
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
disability or qualify for an accidental
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
death benefit so that uh you know if
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
they die or um end up under ordinary
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
disability um and they haven't put in
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
the full age or service requirements
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
they can still qualify for the 2.5%
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
after the first 10 years of credible
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
service so those are the two things um
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
that the amendment does uh we felt like
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
those were reasonable compromises to
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
help bring the cost down without um
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
causing additional hardship to the
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
members with a greater need and uh I
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will consider the
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
amendment okay represent leus do you
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to mention that this bill
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
was the result of the retirement
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
commission and that was not supported in
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee by the Republican legislators
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
or the counties as a representative of
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
employers because of the
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
cost this amendment while
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining the
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
um getting the annuity multiplier up to
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
where it used to
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
be still manages to be about the the
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
amount of money that the Senate is
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
willing to commit to this this plan so I
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a reasonable compromise that
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
we should send on to finance and get an
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
exact cost uh
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're we don't have one yet as modified
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
but it is actually better than some of
 
01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.390 align:start position:0%
but it is actually better than some of
our

01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.629 align:start position:0%
our
previous

01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
um suggestions in the retirement system
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
in that it applies to new hires as well
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
as to existing retirees and it will keep
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
will give the new hires and short-term
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
members eventually the same benefits as
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
every everyone else in in group two so
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm fully supporting it anyone else
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
comment all right in that case the

was representative Simon thank you madam
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%

01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
hb21 all right

second that's represent brto yes okay do
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion uh yes
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um during
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
testimony uh we were told that members
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
who are um doing part-time work uh
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
aren't coming close to the present hours
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
already allotted to them so raising the
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
number of hours um isn't going to
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
benefit them at all and it's also going
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
to push the number of available hours up
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
into the realm where it becomes
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
questionable whether or not they should
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
really just be back on full-time paying
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
into the retirement system so that it
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't dilute the system as a whole um
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons uh we didn't feel
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
like this was an appropriate solution uh
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
to our um shortage staff shortage um so
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
we want to move itl on it Vera thank you
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
Madame chair we've addressed this um
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
type of U Bill many times before and I
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
think this committee feels comfortable
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
with the precedent that we've set with
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
the ex with the current
 
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
hours okay anyone else wish to
 
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
speak okay in that case the motion is
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%

statute that those on accidental
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
disability benefits receive all the
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%

01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations authorized by the
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
legislature in the future this is to
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
include the onetime supplemental
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation pass last year of
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
$500 um
 
01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
somehow um accidental disability
 
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh people members uh were left out of
 
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
um the bill last year so this seeks to
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
give them that money and also to make
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
sure that uh they're treated equally in
 
01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.830 align:start position:0%
sure that uh they're treated equally in
the

01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
future all right R Simon thank you madam
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
chair the amendment before the committee
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh simply raises the um allowance for
 
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
those uh members whose pay in 2023 was
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
not greater than $50,000 as opposed to
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
$40,000 that'll add another I think it
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
was 85
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
86 70 to 80 70 to 80 people um who
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
typically get left out of um these
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
stiens so we wanted to make sure that
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
they were included and the cost isn't
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
going to be very exorbitant so we felt
 
01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
like that was
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable the re the and I I'd like to
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
say that one reason for the increase is
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
that it's largely group two members who
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
do not receive Social Security so their
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
pension is larger than a group one
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments questions
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%

bill is uh one of many bills that we

received um that looks to adjust the
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit for members who of
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
group two who were employed before um is
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
it July of 2000 July 1st 2011 but hadn't
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
been vested um by
 
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
2012 um in this particular uh bill um
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
they were looking to increase those
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
benefits um by allowing overtime pay to
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
be included as base pay and also um for
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
those who commend service honor after
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
July uh before July uh 1st 2011 um for a
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
compensation for extra and special duty
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
to be included in the
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
calculations um even even those who are
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
strongly in support of 1653 um agreed at
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that hb1 1647 is the
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
priority piece of legislation this year
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass both 1647 and this
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill um who which Standalone cost is um
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
is this the 26 million or the 18
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
million uh was 27 million would uh not
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
just be the 27 million because it would
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
build on top of hb1 1647 and increase it
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
even more than that um so we didn't want
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
to get in the way of hb1 1647 and it was
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
just to pricey for consideration this
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
year so for those reasons we're
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
recommending I to the committee
 
01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:34.599 align:start position:0%

good representative Simon uh thank you
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh this is an another one of
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bills that um sought to increase the
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
benefits for that group of members I
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
referred to previously um by changing
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
the um the percentage of um compensation
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
above base pay um once again it it's a
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
large cost concern even if you're
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the arguments of the bill
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um 1647 Still Remains the priority piece
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation and this one um was going
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be $18 million I believe um Plus the
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
added expense of adding it to hb1 1647
 
01:53:54.430 --> 01:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
which would have increased it even more
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
um so for those reasons we're moving
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
interim study okay person
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%

01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill originally was to attempt to reform
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
and redesign the
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
um investment committee and uh in the
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
course of the uh vetting of the bill was
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
discovered that the post concept really
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
didn't work uh and the the sponsor
 
01:55:51.629 --> 01:55:51.639 align:start position:0%

seconds do you wish to speak to your
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you madam chair um so I
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
I would say that coming out of
 
01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.390 align:start position:0%
I would say that coming out of
subcommittee

01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
um the autop pass motion is is more a
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
desire to just bring the idea before the
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
whole committee and have a conversation
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
about it um more so than we feel very
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
very strongly about it um I think
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
everybody can see both sides of the
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
issue um but this bill was brought the
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
original bill was brought before us um
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
because the instructors at the fire fire
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
education uh fire education um at the
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
community college uh were indicating
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
that they were having a difficult time
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
um hiring qualified candidates for that
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
position um and they wanted to have uh
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
members who had 10 years of fire service
 
01:58:05.709 --> 01:58:05.719 align:start position:0%
experience be able to keep their um
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
group two benefits retirement benefits
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
and then move over and take one of these
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
teaching positions uh the community
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
college system as you can see from
 
01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
testimony is against this they don't
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
want to have two different kinds of
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
groups um at the college system uh which
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable argument um the reason
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing this uh Amendment
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
forward is it would up um it would up
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
the requirement to 20 years of fiber
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
fire service experience um before a
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
member could be considered to move over
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
into one of these positions and maintain
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
their benefits
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
um my my biggest concerns after talking
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
to people are that it seems to me that
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
the people that we want teaching these
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
courses are people who have actual field
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
experience um they are teaching the next
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
group of
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters um you know the skills that
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
they will need to protect the rest of
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
the community from fire um if we are
 
01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
indeed having a hard time getting those
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of people to take these positions
 
01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
because they'll end up potentially
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
taking a substantial cut to their
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit if they do which was
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we received um then I
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
would love to see some sort of mechanism
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to keep their
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
benefits and teach these uh in in these
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
positions um I know that there's
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
concerns that we don't typically you
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
know um pass legislation for a couple
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
people which I agree with but I actually
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
think this brings these Educators more
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
in line with other people who um teach
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh either at the fire academy or even
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
with police uh with Fire Chiefs um who
 
01:59:37.149 --> 01:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
aren't still typically fighting fires
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
out in the field um but can still
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintain their group two benefits uh it
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
seems from that perspective that uh we
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
would just be including these um and not
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
making a special exception for these
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
particular educators
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and the last thing that I would say
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
is we opted to 20 years because the
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of group two benefit without
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
question um is the benefit is there
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
because uh the members are putting life
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
and limb on the line every day and after
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
only 10 years uh it didn't seem fair to
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of group two members um to
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
allow them to switch over to this
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
particular kind of job and maintain that
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
benefit but my feeling was potentially
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
after 20 years of actual firefighting uh
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
service in the field putting life and
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
limb on the line um getting fairly close
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
pretty close to their you know full age
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
and service requirements um that having
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
them move into this position um to once
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
again stay active teaching the next
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
generation of firefighters was not so
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
different as I said before from Fire
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
Chiefs or from those who work at the
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
fire academy um so just wanted to to
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
bring that to the attention of the
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee and and have some conversation
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
and see what other people felt about it
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
represent ghoul do you wish to speak to
 
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.510 align:start position:0%
represent ghoul do you wish to speak to
your

02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
second oops thank you madam chair I just
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
think the committee did a really good
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
job uh blending two different points of
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
view anyone else representative goalie
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'll be voting
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and if it comes
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
forward against the bill itself
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
um well I feel the need you know see the
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
need for instructors that have the
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
expertise and experience in the field um
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
once again we just look
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
at robbing heater to pay Paul because
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
you're taking a seasoned 20-year veteran
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the fire service to leave that
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
position to go to a position we're
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
hearing is hard to
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
fill but you need to really go back and
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
look at the municipality you just took
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
that firefighter that has that
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
experience from in the position they're
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
having to fill and they have the same
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
problem filling that
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
position that's one of the reasons okay
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
but the other reason if I may continue
 
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
but the other reason if I may continue
is

02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
you're G to you are going to come into
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
the position where you could be paying
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
two employees doing the same exact job
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
two different benefits one who's come
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
from group two over into that position
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
and someone who may have come from
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
either out of state or just here in New
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that was never in group two is
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
only receiving group one
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
benefits you heard in testimony oh well
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
they there wouldn't be an issue with
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.470 align:start position:0%
they there wouldn't be an issue with
that

02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
well I'm telling you if you were in that
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce and that was happening I'm
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure you would raise a stink and say
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
well I want my position in group two as
 
02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:29.719 align:start position:0%
well because I'm doing the same job he's
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
doing right here and right now um so for
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
those reasons I I can't votee for this
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Pap Miller thank you
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh not having been here during the
 
02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:45.639 align:start position:0%
hearings I I just wanted to ask um you
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
know if the committee is basically
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
trying to help C C csnh when ccsnh says
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need this help thank you very
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
much what what was said during testimony
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
that leads us to you know supporting a
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
bill to help ccsnh against their own
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
objections I just want it was more a
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
matter of considering the
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
employees in in that position and those
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
who might be hired to fill those
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
positions not
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily the community college system
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
which as you say doesn't really want
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
that help repr GR
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay yes I do want to um support the
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
comment that um representative goalie
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
made my concern is that the Community
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
College then is put into a situation
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
where they have two employees doing the
 
02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
same job and
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
um for the The Experience that's
 
02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
required is already being met by someone
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
who's teaching there so I don't support
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
I mean although I understand the
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and I support the work that
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
was done for the amendment I will not be
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment or the bill
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay represent Simon thank you madam
 
02:03:59.229 --> 02:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
chair just I wanted to clarify a couple
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
things and thank you for kindly stating
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's a strange Fusion of
 
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
two different worlds um most of fire
 
02:04:11.229 --> 02:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
training doesn't happen in the education
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
system it happens at the fire academy at
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
least my understanding um so when the
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
crossover happens in the actual College
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
system you've got this kind of strange
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
intermingling of people who sometimes
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for group two in group one
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
positions and and whether or not when
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
they leave one group and go to the other
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh they can maintain their benefits and
 
02:04:32.189 --> 02:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's going to be a
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
hindrance to them doing so um so I you
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
know I understand the college systems
 
02:04:40.109 --> 02:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
situation and and why they're asking
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
what they're asking I think it's
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable once again the the
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
amendment's been brought forward to see
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
how the committee felt about it not so
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
much to strongly push one one position
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
or the other so I just want to make sure
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
that people have information I don't
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
want to give uh
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
no oh thank you I was just going to look
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
over that side representative leus uh
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
thank you although I'm going to oppose
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
the bill for a number of the reasons
 
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned especially by representative
 
02:05:10.549 --> 02:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
goalie I'm going to support the
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean I'm hoping we don't
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
pass this but if it does if we're going
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
to give these people group too I'd
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
rather they have had their 20 years
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
experience it makes more sense so thank
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
you okay represent were you making a
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
comment okay you're good anyone else
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%

academy after hearing the arguments um I

won't be voting for the bill as amended
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
which will seem odd so I thought I'd

evident throughout the course of it um
so

02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%

chair like I said originally um in its
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
in its original form nobody was in
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
support I appreciate people's attention
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
to the amendment um but it became
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
obvious during conversation that people
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
have concerns about this I think those
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
concerns are reasonable so I think itl
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
is a is a suitable motion all right
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
anyone represent goalie I think I've
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%

02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%

02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay in that case the motion
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
is it expedient to legislate on House
 
02:09:59.639 --> 02:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
is it expedient to legislate on House

okay we'll put that one on
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
consent okay and that I believe is all
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
issues so moving on to something
 
02:11:03.390 --> 02:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
completely different representative Shu
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.159 --> 02:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
1324

02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
study okay do you wish to speak to your
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
motion yes um this bill uh dealt with
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
green burials although uh the bill
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
actually was creating a whole new um
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
category of disposing of human remains
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um during the course of the hearing
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee meeting there were
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
many questions raised that were
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
unanswered and so we basically charged
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsors and supporters to uh
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
investigate the possibility of answering
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
these questions and coming up with
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
Solutions possible
 
02:12:12.030 --> 02:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
compromises uh with folks that had
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
questions and to that end uh the
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee voted for to nothing for
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
interim study to allow them time to do
 
02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.069 align:start position:0%
interim study to allow them time to do
that

02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
work Smith do you have a comment I think
 
02:12:33.629 --> 02:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative should have did um
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
explain it very well it was a lot of
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
conflicting testimony but also just too
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
many unanswered questions so that we
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
really uh need to look into this because
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
I think it raises the the subject is is
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
is one that uh deserve further
 
02:12:54.030 --> 02:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
examination so I certainly will support
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
the interim study any anyone else
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
represent laus yeah well I uh I support
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
the idea and during the public hearing I
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any testimony that I thought
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
raised serious concerns I wasn't at the
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and hearing that so given
 
02:13:14.669 --> 02:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
study man py thank you madam chair I do
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
second uh interim study for a reason
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that it's a good option it's a nice way
 
02:13:27.629 --> 02:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
to go another option for end the life
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i' I'd like to say that
 
02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.430 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i' I'd like to say that
green

02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
green
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
burial however defin is available now so
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
we don't need to authorize it the
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh natural organic
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
reduction seems like a much more
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
complicated process it has not been
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
successfully regulated in I believe it's
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
New York or or Connecticut that have
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
authorized it they don't have their
 
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.790 align:start position:0%
authorized it they don't have their
rules

02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
yet maybe it's Massachusetts anyway they
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
were two nearby States and the other
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
issue is that that process produces
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
something like a cubic yard of what it
 
02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.549 align:start position:0%
something like a cubic yard of what it
calls

02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
calls
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
soil and I was concerned that
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
the they didn't have a good good way of
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with it it's we don't I don't
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
think we want them to sell that as you
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
know clean
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
fill um exact we want a respectful
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.549 align:start position:0%
 
covered

02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%

02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:45.800 align:start position:0%

1466 I I have an
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%

it it's amendment
 
02:15:55.239 --> 02:15:57.030 align:start position:0%

02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.549 align:start position:0%
 
seconded

02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
and if anyone wants extra copies I've
 
02:16:20.549 --> 02:16:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
few anyway we had a subcommittee
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on this bill it
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
talked about what the intent was and how
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
the bill was being
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
interpreted we found out that the
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
department of safety and Emer of
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
Department of emergency emergency
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
management is completely Federal funded
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a way to deal with
 
02:16:43.519 --> 02:16:44.389 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a way to deal with
State

02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
funds so they were using this bill as an
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
excuse to set up a complete parallel
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy which was not
 
02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
favored uh they're hiring five new
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
people going to create a new set of
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
rules the whole bit so after talking
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
department and representative Wier who
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
explained how the fiscal committee
 
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
Works representative Shu and I
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
completely rewrote the bill so that what
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
it does is it explicitly gives
 
02:17:18.479 --> 02:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
it does is it explicitly gives
a

02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
town the authority to request from the
 
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:23.950 align:start position:0%
town the authority to request from the
fiscal

02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal
committee

02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
grants um limited to $100,000 a year but
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
the exact amount is at the discretion of
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee based on the
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
disaster or the amount of money that's
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
on hand of
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
course and the intention is
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
that if a disaster occurs what these
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
small towns seem to need most is a
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
little bit of cash in their pocket so
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
they can get keep going uh they need
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
to uh if they're going to be borrowing
 
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
money they need to schedule a town
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
meeting if they're going to be applying
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
for a FEMA Grant which most of them will
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
they need to conduct an assessment of
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
the roads and and get an estimate of the
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
damage and that's not
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
instantaneous so we figured a uh giving
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
them some cash upfront should help them
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
disaster and it it seemed like an
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing for the state to do is
 
02:18:30.509 --> 02:18:30.519 align:start position:0%
to support some of these
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that that's the
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
amendment um I hope it will hope it will
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
work the int we intend is that this
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
could this money could be used for
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
matches for FEMA grants or state grants
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
but if it doesn't
 
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's okay we we don't know the rules
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
well enough to write how to how to make
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
sure that it could be used but we would
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
like to it to be used as matching funds
 
02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
representative shuid and then leus thank
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
you yes I'll just add that um we saw
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
this as a way to get more immediate
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
relief uh for just temporary things such
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
as um in the case of the sponsor it was
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
the main road through her town that has
 
02:19:17.559 --> 02:19:18.429 align:start position:0%
the main road through her town that has
become

02:19:18.429 --> 02:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
impassible uh Bridges things of that
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
sort and it was mentioned that yes these
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
towns can generally get loans to help
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
with these things but in order to obtain
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
a loan they have to call a Town Meeting
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
which takes time and uh some expense so
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
we felt this was the right thing to
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
do represent lus thank you I just want
 
02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure my understanding of the
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is correct so this $100,000
 
02:19:49.389 --> 02:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
limit would be uh per municipality but
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
the fisical committee could Grant up to
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
that for more than one municipality for
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
an emergency yes okay thank
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
you per municipality per
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
year represent BR thank you and so this
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
is this money is actually called relief
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
so it's not a grant per
 
02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
se and it is something that would not be
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
expected to be paid back is that correct
 
02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
expected to be paid back is that correct
yes

02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
because for one thing the town couldn't
 
02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
accept a loan in any short period of
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
time without I have to call a Town
 
02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
Meeting representative
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so I want
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
to emphasize what representative shuart
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
said that that is kind of implicit but
 
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is that they need
 
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:41.950 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is that they need
money

02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
quickly uh and the FEMA process can be
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
quite protracted uh and uh and uh all
 
02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
every every aspect that it was
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
referenced involves delay they need the
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
money fast yes and uh we decided to
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
leave the Declaration of a
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
disaster at the governor's level since
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
he already has that Authority we didn't
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to complicate things by giving the
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety the authority to
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh declare a disaster figure the
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
governor will notice as quickly as
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
questions okay yes represent Brown oh
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
sorry man py sorry thank you Madame
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
chair um leaving the governor the
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
authority to declare emergency and state
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
owning the funds to give it so that way
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's not um passing down the
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
the municipalities or the towns to hold
 
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
the ball as I think it's not downward
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
shifting so it makes a good compromise
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing the immediate need
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Brown uh thank
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
chair so in in the original bill it was
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
they shall not receive more than $5
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
million in a calendar year and now we're
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
at a h 100,000 that's a maximum of
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
100,000 per year is that correct right
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
this does not include regular disaster
 
02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
grants it does not include FEMA grants
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
or matching funds for FEMA grants it's
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
just from
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
this quick access money followup
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes would am I wrong in thinking that
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor thought that this $5
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
million would would not include either
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
of those things you mentioned and it
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
would come from a fund
 
02:22:47.230 --> 02:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay thank you we we
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussed it with the sponsor at the um
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
at the subcommittee and focused in on
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
the main goal was not so much to
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
completely fund the repairs of the
 
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so much as to get a
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
little cash up front understood thank
 
02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
you so we changed the purpose of the
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
bill all right anyone
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
else all right so I have the motion is
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%

second
Sher

02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
Sher
 
02:25:56.469 --> 02:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay you should speak to your motion yes
 
02:25:59.950 --> 02:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so um we had an a subcommittee
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
meeting on this and it became apparent
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
that there are many components to this
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
um request that are interrelated and it
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
needs a much deeper dive than we have
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
time for in um our subcommittee so we
 
02:26:20.670 --> 02:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
are asking to interim study so that we
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
can spend time to ident to uh new really
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
work those uh conflicts out and
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand bit of the process because we
 
02:26:32.269 --> 02:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
do think that um personal
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
identification protection is
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
important okay person
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
gold uh I agree with everything that
 
02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative groy said and I do think
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
that um that both sides have uh equal
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and needs and need to be looked
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
at so I'm happy that we're recommending
 
02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
to take the time and
 
02:26:57.269 --> 02:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
study okay representative leus thank you
 
02:26:59.070 --> 02:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
I understand there's some problems but
 
02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh we've had uh bills addressing this in
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
the past
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know where where
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
the protection of personal information
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
was left out for you know various
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
reasons and there are arguments on the
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
other side um I can't I'm not going to
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
vote in I'm study on this um
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%

committee decides I'm not going to
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
object to consent if that ends up being
 
02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:26.110 align:start position:0%
object to consent if that ends up being
possible

02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
1070 represent Senator blus you have a
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
motion yes um I'd like to make an itl
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 1070 I'll second
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill did is it it uh it
 
02:37:08.349 --> 02:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
said that um employees departments and
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know all parts of the executive
 
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
branch were not permitted to uh violate
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
the USR Federal Constitution uh due to
 
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
you know while following orders of the
 
02:37:20.269 --> 02:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
governor under state of emergency
 
02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
however and you know I certainly hope
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that at least in obvious cases they
 
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't um but some cases may not be
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
clear and we already have put in statute
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
not that long ago in RSA
 
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
445 it says um you know notwithstanding
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
the foregoing enumerated powers civil
 
02:37:41.230 --> 02:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
liberties shall on NOA count be
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
suspended nor shall the United States uh
 
02:37:45.309 --> 02:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
or the New Hampshire Constitution be
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
suspended and so it would be uh against
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
statute for the governor to give them
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
such an order and you know the uh U and
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
I I actually talked to representative uh
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh Lynn about the details on how things
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be interpreted and um and he said
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
it the really the in court the
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate way if you think something
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know that the constitution has been
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
violated would be to uh to bring a case
 
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
against either the governor for
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
violating the statute and the
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution um or perhaps a department
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
head but um going after the individual
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
employees um you
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
know doesn't necessarily make sense I
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
would put them in a difficult position
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
well you know I was following orders is
 
02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
an excuse but not every situation is
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
that clear and therefore I think we
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
should just itl it because it's already
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
covered in statute okay represent BR you
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
wish to make comment on your second no I
 
02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
think representative luus did a good job
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
of summarizing why we are recommending I
 
02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:50.550 align:start position:0%
of summarizing why we are recommending I
okay

02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:52.830 --> 02:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
repr thank you madam chair just a
 
02:38:54.510 --> 02:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
technical question but I'm looking on
 
02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:55.590 align:start position:0%
technical question but I'm looking on
today's

02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
today's
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
calendar uh and it it it lists the bill
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be executing but
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
1070 is not on this list it's on the
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment there was a calendar amendment
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
that came out ah okay thank you and also
 
02:39:10.349 --> 02:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
it's on the back page if you didn't turn
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
one ju just want to make sure we don't
 
02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
step in something here I appreciate your
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
concern but the uh the motion the the
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
calendar Amendment went out we have a
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
few bills that were
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
duplicated but we we're only going to
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
vote on them once my my my point was not
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to object just to make sure we don't
 
02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
violate the rules thank you any other
 
02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
this yeah okay in that case the motion
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
is an expedient to legislate on House

1454 is there a
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
second I'll I'll second
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
motion yes I do thank you madam chair um
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
you might recall that um House Bill
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
1454 um requested that daycare workers
 
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
licensed daycare workers be allowed to
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
um enter into the um retirement fund for
 
02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:17.070 align:start position:0%
um enter into the um retirement fund for
state

02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
workers and that they would pay for
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
their um the fee for their for that U
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefit however the sponsor of the bill
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
brought us an amendment that who intent
 
02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
was that the state would pay for that
 
02:41:36.279 --> 02:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
was that the state would pay for that
benefit

02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
and my concern with that bill was
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
that if license daycare workers were
 
02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to enter the state employee
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
benefit program what would prevent
 
02:41:57.309 --> 02:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
others from also doing that and they are
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
not state
 
02:42:01.469 --> 02:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
employees so although I'm sympathetic to
 
02:42:04.030 --> 02:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
the plight of daycare workers in New
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I think that we read
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
about that quite a bit I don't feel that
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriate way of um
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
addressing that
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative lus do you wish to speak
 
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
that covered it okay anyone
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
else representative Brown uh thank you
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
Madame chair I'll repeat the comment I
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
made during the hearing uh state workers
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
now pay for a small portion of their
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance so if this passed the
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
childcare workers would be getting a
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
better health care benefit than your
 
02:42:40.349 --> 02:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
state employees would yes and looking at
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers we were given it would be
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
about a third more people in in the plan
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
depending on how many took it up and I
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
can't imagine they wouldn't all take it
 
02:42:51.309 --> 02:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
up if it's
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
free so I I don't think that's something
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
we want to sign up
 
02:42:58.990 --> 02:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
for anyone
 
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
else okay the motion is inexpedient to
 
02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%

consent all right seeing none we'll put
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
that on
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
consent and on House Bill
 
02:44:00.110 --> 02:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
1112 I move in expedient to
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislate I'll second 11 12 second by
 
02:44:06.429 --> 02:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
repr BR
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:14.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:15.750 align:start position:0%
you
and

02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think we got any convincing
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is
 
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
Back The Rance of My Demise ex I am so
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
glad to hear
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
that if you say so yeah
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
right so anyway there was no indication
 
02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
that human trafficking was a subject
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
that we should should mandate every
 
02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care worker takes a continuing
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
education class for on every license
 
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
renewal cycle we recommend that
 
02:44:59.710 --> 02:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
everybody take one of the many available
 
02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
courses on the
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
topic but more than once or maybe you
 
02:45:08.269 --> 02:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
know every five or 10 years it it seemed
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
like it would be a redundant effort um
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
and we've heard
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
that mandating class cles that
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
aren't updated is a good way to get
 
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
people to not pay attention to what
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
their requirements are
 
02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
so I recommend
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
itl sh I'll just State further that um
 
02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
while the committee does not feel this
 
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
should be mandated uh it certainly would
 
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
be within the perview of the
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
professional boards to include some kind
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
of training on this if they choose to
 
02:45:48.349 --> 02:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
yes the testimony was that there are
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
quite a number of such classes available
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
but uh and we would certainly want to
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
recommend people take one of them at
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
least representative Schmidt and then
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
sign I just want to clarify Madam chair
 
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien was just walking
 
02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
in the door as you were as you were
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
making your motion so is going to be
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
able to you restated your itl motion the
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
question has not yet been called he we
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the discussion section thank you
 
02:46:16.349 --> 02:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative
 
02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair I will be
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl I just wanted to
 
02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
comment I think I'd be more sympathetic
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
towards this bill um if it was just a
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
one-time training at the beginning of
 
02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
service uh just to make sure that people
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
have exposure to the topic which I do
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
think is an important one um but as you
 
02:46:36.990 --> 02:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
we did we never had an amendment to that
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
effect so as you've uh pointed out uh
 
02:46:43.230 --> 02:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
having it done on a regular basis is um
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
cumbersome in isn't going to help them
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
in their actual studies okay anyone
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%

we need this level of lure the bill
 
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
essentially required our State Board of
 
02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine to set up a an apprenticeship
 
02:49:29.950 --> 02:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
program that's equivalent to a Residency
 
02:49:32.349 --> 02:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
program and I wouldn't want to stick the
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Education with that the Board
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%

legislate for House Bill 1601 is there a
 
02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
second I'll second all right do you wish
 
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to your
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
motion uh House Bill 1601 makes two
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
changes drug affordability board it
 
02:50:54.429 --> 02:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
makes the uh executive director 10 year
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
four years and it removes the oversight
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal committee on the uh uh
 
02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
bidding for contracts and because
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's no uh because it's uncommon to
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
do that I don't think that's necessary
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
oversight represent
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
BR yes into testimony it was presented
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken that um the drug
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
affordability board was in agreement
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
with this but it seems that there is a
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
conf there's a conflicting
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
um thought on this and until that gets
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
resolved I think we should take we
 
02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
should address we should ital the bill
 
02:51:41.469 --> 02:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
and also the department of
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is putting
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
together a report on the drug
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
affordability board and we should wait
 
02:51:49.710 --> 02:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
until we get that report before we make
 
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
any changes thank you okay anyone
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
else just one second representative
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair the the only
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
thing that I remember from this bill
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
that I had concern with um was it seemed
 
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
to me that um by allowing one of our own
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
committees to oversee monies that had
 
02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
already been
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated um we might be setting a
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
fairly dangerous precedent uh as far as
 
02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
overseeing any funds that we've
 
02:52:21.309 --> 02:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the executive um Branch
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
for for use it's just not something
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's typically done I do have um some
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about that um so I just wanted
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
to at least bring that to everybody's
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
attention again I actually think that
 
02:52:34.990 --> 02:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
the um AG might be looking into that as
 
02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.269 align:start position:0%
the um AG might be looking into that as
we

02:52:37.269 --> 02:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
speak well then I would think we don't
 
02:52:43.269 --> 02:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
want to step in front of Das and the
 
02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General would be that would be
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
a dangerous precedent for us to set when
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're not really sure we understand the
 
02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:51.550 align:start position:0%
we're not really sure we understand the
issues

02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
involved represent
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
Schmid I just think that cutting the
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee out of oversight is not
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
a good idea okay anyone
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
else okay the motion is inexpedient to
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%

Bill 1410 representative
 
04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
leus thank you I'd like to move to adopt
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
um Amendment uh
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
by okay okay and you wish to speak to
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
your motion I believe I do um so this
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill did a wide range of uh of things um
 
04:05:16.750 --> 04:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
one was to eliminate the uh licensing of
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
lnas now they already were required to
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
be registered under federal statute and
 
04:05:24.990 --> 04:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
the idea was that U it would make the
 
04:05:25.000 --> 04:05:26.189 align:start position:0%
the idea was that U it would make the
process

04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
easier um and cheaper for the lnas and
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
we certainly need more lnas and they
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't get paid a whole lot um however
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
and in the subcommittee we really worked
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
to see if we could do this and we got
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
through almost everything except there
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
was one hurdle which is um with just the
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
federal registration oplc could not
 
04:05:48.990 --> 04:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
require a background check and if they
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
only worked at medical facilities they
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
could require but the problem is that
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a growing trend
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
for uh families to privately hire lnas
 
04:06:02.990 --> 04:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
to assist their elderly relatives so
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
they can still be taken care of at home
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
and don't have to go to nursing homes
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
and all that and so the end we decided
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
um that we would we would leave the LNA
 
04:06:15.630 --> 04:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
licensing and so this amendment removes
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
that from the bill this amendment
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
actually replaces the whole bill um the
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing almost in aside but uh
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
through the discussion uh director
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
Courtney thinks that um she may be able
 
04:06:29.229 --> 04:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
to make things easier on the LNA as far
 
04:06:31.630 --> 04:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
as the trouble and expense of Licensing
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
but through rulemaking without statute
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah and incidentally we have another
 
04:06:39.550 --> 04:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
bill on the qualification for lnas that
 
04:06:42.670 --> 04:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet heard that will also be
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate to consider the licensing
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
issues there okay now a lot of the rest
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill is just a statutory cleanup
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh there are a number of things that
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
where we gave the authority to um oplc
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know fee setting and various other
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
and actually issuing licenses and all of
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
that where um there are some cases where
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
the uh in statute the authority and
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility also remain with the
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
boards creating a conflict so like sort
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
of by volume the bulk of this actually
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
is uh cleaning that up another minor
 
04:07:18.429 --> 04:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
clean up which is including aprns with
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
RNs um as possible uh you know on the
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
board of nursing the other um
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
non-trivial change was it removes the
 
04:07:30.389 --> 04:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
registration of medical technicians so
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
medical technicians are as defined in
 
04:07:36.189 --> 04:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
the bill are are people who work who do
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare work they're not not
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise licensed so they're not nurses
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
doctors any of that um and they have
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
access to
 
04:07:47.229 --> 04:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and they uh they have uh
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
the possibility of contact with patients
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the idea I guess was to register
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
them and you know that be some process
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
for maybe dealing with complaints um
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
problem is is and this is testimony we
 
04:08:05.309 --> 04:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
heard from oplc was that people in in
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
those jobs don't generally tend to see
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
it as a profession they can't they only
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
found one person ever who is at all
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on the board um
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
the board has never been able to meet
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
with a quorum because there only been
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
one person therefore the board has been
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
unable to create rules on anything which
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
means oplc can't do anything with regard
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the medical
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
technicians um I mean if they get a
 
04:08:33.070 --> 04:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
complaint she said on a clearly criminal
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
matter they can refer to law enforcement
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
but otherwise and but anybody could do
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
that um so this this well you know I'm
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
sure well-meaning attempt to provide
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
some protection is just completely
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-functional and we don't see any way
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
it could be you know maybe some future
 
04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
legislature can come up with a better
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
way of of solving what is perceived as a
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
problem but this isn't it and I want to
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
get you know I think we want to get rid
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
of it because it provides a i u you know
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
the view or or sets the impression that
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
the state is providing some protection
 
04:09:07.109 --> 04:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
when it is not and that we shouldn't be
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that's basically it okay
 
04:09:11.070 --> 04:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative Brown do you wish to
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your second uh no I think Tony
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
is representative lcus has covered
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Schmid thank you
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair so I second representative
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
Le's remarks or
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
third uh with regard to the situation
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the medical technicians that the
 
04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill was well intentioned it was was
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
generated for a very good cause but the
 
04:09:39.630 --> 04:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is it does not work and
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
therefore there's no no sense
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
maintaining it um and with the LNA
 
04:09:48.189 --> 04:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
situation uh you didn't reference it but
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
as you probably know uh there are a lot
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
of lnas that work for nursing homes
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
where the background checks are
 
04:09:57.189 --> 04:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial those people are
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of people who are
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
easy to take advantage of if you're of
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
that disposition we cannot let those
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
people lose loose on the Nur own
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
population so perhaps you'd speak to
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay um represent I I don't
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
disagree I was just uh the reason I
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
emphasized the ones where they're
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
actually in somebody's home the nursing
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
home at least there's some management
 
04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
there but if they're in somebody's home
 
04:10:23.149 --> 04:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else same difference and
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the even worse yeah
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative man py thank
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I agree with uh
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
everything that representative laa said
 
04:10:34.750 --> 04:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
my still my concern I was on the
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the concern that's hanging
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
loose is the medical technician one
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's there's no anchoring of that
 
04:10:45.550 --> 04:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility any place and there are
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know they're not licensed they're
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
registered but no oversight kind of
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
thing so I'm hoping that future
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
legislation can bring some kind of a
 
04:10:59.550 --> 04:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
oversight into that and that will make
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative leus yeah I
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
I understand the only thing I could say
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
is that medical technicians don't have
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
their own practice all working for some
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
employer who is responsible like any
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
employer for the action of their
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
employees and if somebody feels they've
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
been harmed their their you know open
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
liability at least that's something but
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
I understand yeah I I'd like to mention
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
that when we created that
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
registration um it was because the
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
employers were not acting responsibly to
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
discipline their
 
04:11:36.750 --> 04:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
employees and that was the root cause
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
was found to be the root cause of of
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
most of the issues so
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
um yes representative gold thank you
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair I also served on the
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I just want I agree
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
with everything that's been said by
 
04:11:52.590 --> 04:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
everybody I just wanted to add regarding
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
the the right now oplc gets complaints
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
about people who fit under this category
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
of medical technician but with no board
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate the complaint and verify
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's a valid complaint or not
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
oplc is is prevented from taking any
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
further action unless it rises to a
 
04:12:14.349 --> 04:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
criminal offense and there's been
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
several of these calls that have come in
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
and so it's creating an even more
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous situation where people think
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
they can complain to the state and then
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
the complaint is just sitting there and
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
nobody has the ability to act on it and
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
that it's causing stress for the staff
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
and a danger to the
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%

04:15:25.109 --> 04:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
on that um as I'm working on an
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
amendment which should be do you have a
 
04:15:31.109 --> 04:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
motion you could make now on 1679 I do
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill 16 we do that one first
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
then nine Madam chair I move that we
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
retain that bill interim study is the
 
04:15:44.030 --> 04:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
way for second year okay interim study
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
interim study all right is there a
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
second okay by representative GS second
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
by representative leus do you wish to
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure Madam chair we
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
have uh several bills we're looking at
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
and uh we'd like this bill retained to
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
be able to possibly um put an amendment
 
04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
in but it needs some study
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay represent blackis thank you I agree
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
um I looked at this carefully and
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
there's actually some real defects in it
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
in the scheme for um when it would
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
become act effective and there's a
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
section there section three never can I
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
had a discussion with the prime sponsor
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh he agreed there's some other
 
04:16:30.830 --> 04:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
technical problems and other problems
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the bill so it's certainly not
 
04:16:35.790 --> 04:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
ready and interim stud is fine okay does
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%

04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
um next week on Thursday the 15th the
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
session won't start until
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
1:00 um we can have a morning executive
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
session for this one bill if we like
 
04:18:13.229 --> 04:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
since we're all going to be coming in
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
for the session or we can push it
 
04:18:18.910 --> 04:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
further out into
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
March um but with the other bills we
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
have any uh anybody have a strong
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
other well there might be we're going to
 
04:18:34.349 --> 04:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
have some hearings next week right so
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
there might be other bills that we could
 
04:18:39.790 --> 04:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
accept at the same time correct uh no
 
04:18:41.309 --> 04:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the amount of time
 
04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
they have to be well no we they have to
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
be either the same day as the hearing or
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
announced on the floor and this would be
 
04:18:51.870 --> 04:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
before the floor so no it would be and
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know what today is February 6th or
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
7th already right so I'm thinking we're
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
two weeks ahead but we're really not
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's next week so so sorry February is
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
flying by yes February is flying
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.800 --> 04:19:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
right Madam chair I have no preference
 
04:19:16.990 --> 04:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
whatever works for the committee okay
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
anyone does have a preference I'm kind
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
of thinking that an exec for one bill is
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
probably uh not per not
 
04:19:25.600 --> 04:19:27.269 align:start position:0%
probably uh not per not
efficient

04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't have any other
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
bills so let's see when's the deadline
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
deadline for first committee bills is
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
Thursday it's a one committee bill so
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
its deadline is the is uh March
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
21st so
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%

thank you all right
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
um 039 99 all right this amendment is
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
the oplc comments and it cleans up
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
statutory conflicts that were in the
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill it it's it is of course
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
housekeeping which I will not say but
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
um it is it just cleans up the the uh
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutes I do not support
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but if there's support
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
for it I would want it to be as good a
 
04:36:30.510 --> 04:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill as possible so that's why I'm
 
04:36:32.590 --> 04:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this amendment forward
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
represent groa I agree that when we
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
present a bill from our committee it
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
should be as um perfect as possible and
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
I think um the chair for issuing this
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendment okay anyone else have a
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
amendment I missed it if you explained
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
what you have done with this amendment
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
it um it cleans up the statutory
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
references the conflict Ed
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
between last year's oplc statute and
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
this year's oplc statute essentially do
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
you want a copy of it I no I have it
 
04:37:19.510 --> 04:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay I might add that the sponsor of the
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
bill really does issue the exact same
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that they had provided last
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
year without regard to the changes that
 
04:37:30.429 --> 04:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
we had made so it was important that we
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
don't put in
 
04:37:34.230 --> 04:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that conflicts with
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
something that we've already already
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
done especially when we have an
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that cleans it up right okay
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%

rampant situation we have in our state

that every form of therapy I think is
 
04:39:50.430 --> 04:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly important and music
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
therapists cannot be covered by
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
insurance without a licensing process
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
which means veterans and other citizens
 
04:39:59.628 --> 04:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
who need the service and who will
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from the service and help to at
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
least deal with the effects of the
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
mental illness crisis cannot use those
 
04:40:10.030 --> 04:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
Services through their normal insurance
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
they have to pay for it out of their
 
04:40:13.990 --> 04:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
pockets so it leaves our most vulnerable
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
citizens unable to use a therapeutic
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
service that will benefit them thank you
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
represent man thank you madam chair
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
being a farmer speech therapist who used
 
04:40:27.910 --> 04:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
music internation therapy for
 
04:40:29.910 --> 04:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
communication especially with the
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
population of aasia which is stroke and
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh loss of speech post stroke this is a
 
04:40:37.440 --> 04:40:39.190 align:start position:0%
uh loss of speech post stroke this is a
common

04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
common
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
predominantly uh seen in veteran
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
population as well as in the nonverbal
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
DD population so this is a very critical
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
piece and this will add to the toolbox
 
04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
of uh rehab and therapeutic intervention
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
for many different population and I
 
04:41:03.310 --> 04:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
think this will be a huge asset in terms
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
of provid proving opportunities for our
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
citizens here in New Hampshire thank you
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
madam thank you represent leus thank you
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh not to denigrate anybody offering
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
speech therapy but I don't you know as
 
04:41:19.708 --> 04:41:19.718 align:start position:0%
I've said before I think the only
 
04:41:21.788 --> 04:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to support um
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing is a real and
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
significant threat to public health and
 
04:41:28.590 --> 04:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
safety and I don't see that from music
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
therapist I mean if there were somebody
 
04:41:34.030 --> 04:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
had an idea of uh whether it was called
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
to license or whatever that would um
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
permit them to get reimbursed I think
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
particular issues are are Medicare
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I might support that but to set
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
up a whole licensing scheme and board
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
and all or include them in another one I
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
think it does um I just don't think it's
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
it all right
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
yes so um I will be supporting this bill
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that um we can have a
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.990 --> 04:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
it all right well I I'm strongly opposed
 
04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
we do have music therapists working in
 
04:42:15.400 --> 04:42:16.270 align:start position:0%
we do have music therapists working in
New

04:42:16.270 --> 04:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're they don't need a license their
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
employers recognize their skills and
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
hire them um and I like repres leus I
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's Justified to set
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
up this procedure simply because some
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't want to cover
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
what is medically necessary or
 
04:42:45.070 --> 04:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate represent Papa Miller thank
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just a very quick note
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
that if there is an issue with the
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
services of these people not being
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
covered under health insurance I think
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that we should look at
 
04:42:58.590 --> 04:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
solutions for but to create a licens in
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
scheme that creates barriers to entry
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
and makes it harder for music therapist
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
to enter this field I just don't feel
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
this is the right solution I would be
 
04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
happy to look at other ways to solve
 
04:43:12.510 --> 04:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
that issue without making it harder to
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
for people to come into the
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.718 --> 04:43:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
concern

04:43:28.990 --> 04:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent I'll take up a couple seconds
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
to uh just make a comment um in regards
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
to representative leakes's comment about
 
04:43:41.070 --> 04:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh this particular profession perhaps
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
not being a matter of life and death I
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
think uh there is something to be said
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
about quality of life and I believe that
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
the work that these folks do does
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
enhance the quality of life and perhaps
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
in some cases May um turn someone's life
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
around who is contemplating suicide for
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
example so thank you
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative leus yeah I I I thought I
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
try to make clear that you know I do I
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
see the value in them um and so it's not
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
a matter of saying there's no value but
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I think the risk of them practicing
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
it inappropriately and therefore causing
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
a significant risk to public health and
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
safety isn't there and that's the
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
justification for in my view for doing
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
licensing it's not saying they're
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're without
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
value thank you Simon
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that sentiment I I
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
think that the Divide on this bill is
 
04:44:41.470 --> 04:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
not um whether or not we think music
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
therapy is effective um in treating um
 
04:44:47.230 --> 04:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
people with certain in certain
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
situations uh I think there's General
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that that's more than likely
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
the case and that people should have
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
access to music therapy and nobody's
 
04:44:56.430 --> 04:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
trying to block that uh The Divide just
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
comes uh I think between the two sides
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
on whether or not licensing is the
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate mechanism to do that my
 
04:45:05.230 --> 04:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
major concern with the
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
um is on line 10 of Page Three where it
 
04:45:10.750 --> 04:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
says no person without a license as a
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
music therapist shall use the title of
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
Music therapist or similar title or
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
practice music therapy um if I would be
 
04:45:21.310 --> 04:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
more sympathetic to the bill if a music
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
therapist could continue in practicing
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
unlicensed but also had the option of
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
getting a license if they wanted to be
 
04:45:31.868 --> 04:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
able to take insurance um rather than uh
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
especially since we don't uh at least if
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
I remember testimony correctly um there
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
aren't a lot of complaints that music
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
therapists are causing a great deal of
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
harm um and so it doesn't seem like it's
 
04:45:48.030 --> 04:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
a safety issue um as far as poor poor
 
04:45:49.868 --> 04:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
treatment is concerned so where we're
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
not protecting people in that regard um
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and as representative um papovich uh
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
sorry how do you say it's papovich
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
Miller okay yeah um uh stated um I just
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to create that extra
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
um burden that extra uh step now now
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to go to a
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
licensing board and um get other
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
people's permission to practice in the
 
04:46:15.628 --> 04:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we haven't needed
 
04:46:18.270 --> 04:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
that barrier um uh so I don't want to
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
implement it so if we could if if there
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a way of creating um a
 
04:46:26.350 --> 04:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
solution where somebody could continue
 
04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
to practice
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and there was also an Avenue
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
to get a license um so that the people
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
who need to can can um get insurance
 
04:46:39.788 --> 04:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
coverage um I'd be much more apt to vote
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
in favor of the
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else yes represent gold
 
04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i' just like to
 
04:46:48.750 --> 04:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the comments we did
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
hear testimony that that this is a
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
science in that there are methods and
 
04:46:57.868 --> 04:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
procedures that are therapeutic and
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
there is use of Music in ways that are
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
not therapeutic and are harmful in fact
 
04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
to people and for anyone that would
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
question that I watched last night as
 
04:47:11.310 --> 04:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
they were using torture by bluring loud
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
music at patients so I'm not insinuating
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
that anybody claiming to be a music
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
therapist would be torturing people but
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard from the
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
professionals who were asking for the
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
licensing was that it can be harmful and
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
it can be applied in harmful ways so I
 
04:47:30.548 --> 04:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
do think that safety is important and
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
and I agree that there should be other
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
ways to get insurance companies to act
 
04:47:38.190 --> 04:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
in ways that honor what's healthy for
 
04:47:40.750 --> 04:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
people but in I don't think the state
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
legislature can enact that and but what
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
we can do and the way the system is set
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
up whether we like it or not and I do
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
not like it is we can provide licensing
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
categories for professionals who have a
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic millu behind them that
 
04:47:57.390 --> 04:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
improves people's lives and that when
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
used in appropriately could harm people
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that will allow insurance companies
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
to reimburse for their services
 
04:48:08.430 --> 04:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anyone else repres Simon
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to to respond
 
04:48:13.868 --> 04:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
to that for clarification purposes um I
 
04:48:15.070 --> 04:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that what we're saying is
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that harm can't be done but rather
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire is
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
harm being done is there are we
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
responding to to real harm and it didn't
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember anyway you can
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I don't remember
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
any testimony over the last few years
 
04:48:31.948 --> 04:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
that has brought forward um the idea
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
that people who are um
 
04:48:35.948 --> 04:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
giving these services in the state of
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have done so in in an
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate manner so the question would
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
be whether Licensing in New Hampshire um
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
is necessary in order to to create that
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
protection if people are doing this
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and we have no real incidence
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
of malpractice I guess um if we don't if
 
04:48:54.430 --> 04:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
we don't really have that then I don't
 
04:48:55.868 --> 04:48:55.878 align:start position:0%
see then we'd be fixing a problem that
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in the state of New
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay anyone else represent man
 
04:49:05.548 --> 04:49:05.558 align:start position:0%
py thank you Madam chair just to
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
clarify there is no harm done but the
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
access to a therapy like this which is
 
04:49:13.628 --> 04:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
for communication behavior
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
modification and uh other stress relief
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
specific to post-traumatic stress
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
disorder those kind of things are very
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
specified music therapy and that access
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
is not available to people who need it
 
04:49:31.868 --> 04:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
the most at the time they need it
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
because there is no licensed pack in
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of you know we have seen other um
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
you know like the yoga or other modality
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
non uh pharmaceutical or
 
04:49:48.670 --> 04:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
non-medical uh modalities to treat
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
certain conditions and music therapy is
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
a certified it in other states as well
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
as in um other uh parts of the world
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
where it is very specifically trained to
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
do certain things for certain group of
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
population and it's it is very effective
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
so in order to say it's only when there
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
is a harm done done negatively that we
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to identify I think that's one way
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
of looking at it there's another
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial one preventive and early
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
intervention part of it so from that
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
point of view I think the music therapy
 
04:50:30.390 --> 04:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be a beneficial tool for our
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire okay
 
04:50:37.390 --> 04:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else need to say
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
anything in that case the motion is
 
04:50:42.270 --> 04:50:42.280 align:start position:0%

um and it also um to kind of move the
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
commission along and doing their work
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
had uh repeals scheduled over some
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
period of of years of the licensing
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
boards well I never expected uh any of
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
them to actually get repealed and either
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
the commission would do the work or
 
04:54:43.708 --> 04:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
somebody would put in something to get
 
04:54:45.628 --> 04:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
rid of the repeals it generated a lot of
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
concern and I understand that and so
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
among other things this amendment
 
04:54:52.548 --> 04:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
removes all the repeals other than it
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
repeals this the sunset commission after
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
five years well it's not Sunset anymore
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
by the way the name and the title
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
nowhere in there is it sunset because
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's not sunsetting anymore but um
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
there is in statute a requirement that
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
commissions um end after five years but
 
04:55:12.548 --> 04:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
to make it explicit we put it in here um
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
now the
 
04:55:16.590 --> 04:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh met on this but we had a
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time uh we did come to
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
agreement on changes to the statement of
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
purpose which are in the
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
amendment and I made some changes
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in that line there was
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
language from the statement of purpose
 
04:55:32.430 --> 04:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
parts of it that were elsewhere in the
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill and I removed or made changes to go
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
along with uh changes a statement of
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
purpose the other big change was um to
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
change the membership and there were
 
04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
serious problems with the membership in
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and this changes it to
 
04:55:52.990 --> 04:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh more typical of these sort of
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
commissions um and it's now two members
 
04:55:58.510 --> 04:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
of house cedna one being for the
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
minority uh party appointed by the
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
speaker one member of House Commerce
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
Consumer Affairs is appointed by the
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
speaker and similarly for the Senate two
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
from Edna one minority and one from
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
Commerce and then in
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
addition um one public member
 
04:56:17.310 --> 04:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
representing interest of businesses in
 
04:56:19.548 --> 04:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire appointed by the Bia and
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
the thought there is you know
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
organizations that employ a lot of
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
people who are licensed it might make
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
sense to have them in there um executive
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
director of oplc or design uh two public
 
04:56:32.798 --> 04:56:34.110 align:start position:0%
director of oplc or design uh two public
members

04:56:34.110 --> 04:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then one public member and that's
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor with consent
 
04:56:40.030 --> 04:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the council one public member
 
04:56:42.990 --> 04:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
representing Healthcare employers again
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
they since a large portion of people who
 
04:56:47.708 --> 04:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
are licensed work in the health care
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
industry figure that makes sense to have
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who's involved in employing
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
them uh there and then there's the usual
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
the public members can't be licensed or
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
have any direct um interest in it which
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
is the same thing for public members on
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
the actual licensing boards
 
04:57:10.628 --> 04:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
um and then the section of uh what the
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
commission should look
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
at is basically the same as before
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
although some of the introductory
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
language which had some text similar to
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
what was in the original statement of
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
purpose had been
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
changed um I know there was some concern
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
about these but if you look
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
at uh page two of the amendment starting
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know line
 
04:57:34.990 --> 04:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
26 so the the the types of
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
Regulation that they're to consider is
 
04:57:41.070 --> 04:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
is a long list and um for those who are
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
concerns if you look at the at the end
 
04:57:46.548 --> 04:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
of the list these are just things and by
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
the way it's things that they
 
04:57:54.830 --> 04:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
um they may consider right um let's
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
see these are things that they can
 
04:57:58.270 --> 04:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
consider but there's nothing in here
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
that says what they have to pick and one
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the options is occupational license
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
the same as it is to today and the
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
report shall include its findings
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations um to enact legisl
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
legislation that and then there's a
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
whole list and there's an or in there at
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
line 15 on page three and the last one
 
04:58:19.590 --> 04:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
is make no changes to the law so this is
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
um you know things that they can that
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
they are to consider but options they to
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
consider but it doesn't specify what
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
they have to do and there's nothing in
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
here that would uh tell the commission
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
they have to make an any change at all
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
if they think things are just fine they
 
04:58:36.600 --> 04:58:38.350 align:start position:0%
if they think things are just fine they
are

04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:58:40.990 --> 04:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and then it also directs the
 
04:58:43.150 --> 04:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
commission to you know look at the scope
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
of practice and the qualifications
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
required to get a license that's that's
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
the main things that uh the boards do
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
and look at other potential concerns um
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
and there is I think there was some
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
comment I don't know if was the
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
committee or subcommittee that we have
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
um you know the performance audits like
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
we recently we had the Dental Board and
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health Board those are
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking at whether or not the um board
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
or is following the statute created by
 
04:59:13.798 --> 04:59:14.470 align:start position:0%
or is following the statute created by
the

04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh and are they doing it
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
in an effective and efficient manner but
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
it's not their charge or their business
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
to actually look at whether the
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme is um is really the the
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
the best and the thing is is that the
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know industry changes uh professions
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
change the technology the expertise uh
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
the techniques all of that and the needs
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
of the consumer change over the years
 
04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
and some of these boards were put in
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
place many years ago and I think it's
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
good to uh you know step back and take a
 
04:59:49.708 --> 04:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
look at each one and say you know to the
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know we need to protect public
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
health and safety but we want to put as
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
few barriers imp Poss as possible into
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
people like you know working are we
 
04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
striking the right balance between those
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
two and if not what changes should be
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
made and maybe the answer is on you know
 
05:00:06.430 --> 05:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
some boards it's it's just fine and
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
maybe most of them that would be up to
 
05:00:08.160 --> 05:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
maybe most of them that would be up to
the

05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:09.040 --> 05:00:10.948 align:start position:0%
the
commission

05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and that's uh that's basically it the
 
05:00:18.190 --> 05:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
commission is required to put out a
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
report per board um there is no
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled dates when they have to put
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
out um a report because they can take
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
the boards in any order they want and I
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't predict that and so I can't say
 
05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
there has to be um you know they just
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
have to do it before they're done um
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
other concerns I've heard are there's
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
already an oversight oplc oversight
 
05:00:44.590 --> 05:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee but which I and others on this
 
05:00:47.830 --> 05:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know on the committee here on but
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
that has the way it's working is it's
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
looking at current ongoing stuff so you
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
know how well is the rul making process
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to respond to statutory changes
 
05:01:02.070 --> 05:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
and hearing about concerns from people
 
05:01:03.310 --> 05:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
generally either either from the
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
licensed Comm people community people
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
who are licensed or from you know
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
potentially from uh customers of theirs
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about what's going on now and
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
from the those who are licensed you know
 
05:01:16.590 --> 05:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
is oplc functioning well have they may
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
have complaints about delays or whatever
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
else and so that committee is looking at
 
05:01:24.548 --> 05:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
current ongoing issues but it's not you
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
know doesn't have a charge of of looking
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
at restructuring the whole thing um the
 
05:01:31.750 --> 05:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is that that's a committee
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
which means it can't have have anybody
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
on it by but legislators whereas a
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
commission can and I think it's
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
important to have um you know some
 
05:01:41.470 --> 05:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
public members and members like
 
05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
representing um you know major consumer
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
groups in other words a certain
 
05:01:45.840 --> 05:01:47.708 align:start position:0%
groups in other words a certain
business

05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh that's that's basically I
 
05:01:53.190 --> 05:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
think it's good periodically to step
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
back and take a look and see is is it
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
the right way I mean we've done a lot of
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
work we've done
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the bureaucracy to help
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the function but except where
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
there's been particular bills for
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
particular boards we haven't looked at
 
05:02:12.670 --> 05:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the details of what's going
 
05:02:16.150 --> 05:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
on with a particular board is the
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
statute right um are the rules right and
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
is it functioning the way it should and
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's a value to do that thank
 
05:02:24.360 --> 05:02:26.548 align:start position:0%
I think it's a value to do that thank
you

05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
br representative luus is a tough act to
 
05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
follow first of all I want to commend
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
the committee and I want to commend
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
representative leus because this was a
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
lot of work and it represents a lot of
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
work we although I agree and I support
 
05:02:47.070 --> 05:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment I don't support the
 
05:02:49.708 --> 05:02:49.718 align:start position:0%
premise of the Bill of forming another
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
commission so but this this amendment in
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
my mind makes the bill significantly
 
05:03:00.270 --> 05:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
better and I don't want the work and the
 
05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
efforts and the passion that was put to
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
unrecognized so yes I will support the
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
amendment right thank you representative
 
05:03:17.788 --> 05:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair um
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
I have trouble supporting this amendment
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
um another commission that gives a
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
report five years from now um made of of
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
legislators and Senators who may start
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
from when this is passed in an election
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
year to form members and those members
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
may not be here in two years to start
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
over and continue moving on
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I I just can't support but another
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:50.670 --> 05:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
is this commission is made up of
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
business folks and people have interest
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
in it doesn't have a single lensey on
 
05:03:56.718 --> 05:03:57.590 align:start position:0%
in it doesn't have a single lensey on
the

05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
commission not one license e to
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
represent their position as to why they
 
05:04:03.788 --> 05:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
there and I think that's important if
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a commission all the
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholders should be part of that
 
05:04:14.830 --> 05:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
commission so with that being out I mean
 
05:04:17.230 --> 05:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
I don't see I can't I can't support it
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
and then another
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
reason being once again those have been
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
around long enough see we have
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
commissions here that do work spend
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
three four years putting something
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
together that gets put into a binder
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
says we should do this and we should do
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
that and we should do this for
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and it gets filed and put
 
05:04:41.548 --> 05:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
away because the legislature five years
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
from now is totally
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
different it's a lot of work done by
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
these members and this is what happens
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
and it's reality
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
folks those that have been here long
 
05:04:54.990 --> 05:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
enough know it's
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
reality so when we had the committee on
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
committees and Commissioners to get rid
 
05:05:00.830 --> 05:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
of a lot of these this is one of the
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.798 --> 05:05:06.868 align:start position:0%
 
happens

05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
happens
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
and I'll just leave on one last note
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
that we already have
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee on oplc and we
 
05:05:17.920 --> 05:05:18.750 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee on oplc and we
have

05:05:18.750 --> 05:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
Audits and then anybody else has the
 
05:05:24.190 --> 05:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
right to look at any of the boards like
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
we see legislation coming in year after
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
year after year to try and
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
change a certain board to advisory not
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
to advis
 
05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
should we license this individual what
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
should we do to not license it's being
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
done we don't need a commission to tell
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
us which boards need oversight which
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
boards need what's going on it's being
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
done now so I can't support this thank
 
05:05:46.160 --> 05:05:47.948 align:start position:0%
done now so I can't support this thank
you

05:05:47.948 --> 05:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay repres represent man py and then
 
05:05:54.670 --> 05:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
leus and then she thank you madam chair
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
I did serve on the subcommittee it was a
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
lot of work and I commend uh
 
05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative L for putting ours in
 
05:06:07.030 --> 05:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
painstakingly working diligently on
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
getting the amendment again many of the
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
reasons um stated by representative
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
goalie my concern is also creating
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
another commission and holding the
 
05:06:24.030 --> 05:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
future legislator responsible and future
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
members who are not even we don't even
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
know who's going to be on it hold them
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
hold their feet to the fire to get
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
things done I don't think we can do it
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
as a current sitting legislation
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislators so from that point of view I
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a huge concern and again another
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
commission to oversee the
 
05:06:47.080 --> 05:06:50.030 align:start position:0%
commission to oversee the
committee's

05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
commissions doesn't make any double
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
negative doesn't make it positive in
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
this case thank you much representative
 
05:07:00.590 --> 05:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
leus um thank you just uh to deal with
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh some concerns about uh the board um
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
if you look in the bill it's not the
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
idea that that at the end of five years
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to put out a report
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're directed to do a report per
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
board and they would you know presumably
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
come out when they were done with it so
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
I would expect a series of results I
 
05:07:21.310 --> 05:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
mean coming out and um maybe in five
 
05:07:22.270 --> 05:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
years they don't get through all the
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
boards I hope they would but you never
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
know I you can't and we have plenty of
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
commissions that exist that aren't being
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of that seem to be doing
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
doing good work
 
05:07:34.830 --> 05:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
that have been and continue on for a
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
period of years and people are working
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
on them and they are producing uh
 
05:07:43.390 --> 05:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
results and so I don't think that well
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
you know certainly I I recognize the
 
05:07:46.990 --> 05:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
risk that the commission might not do
 
05:07:49.310 --> 05:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
anything effective and we can't make
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
them do that we certainly have plenty of
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
examples of commissions that are meeting
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
and doing ongoing good work um and
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh anyway that's that's uh
 
05:08:01.230 --> 05:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully to deal a little bit with that
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.670 --> 05:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair um I will be
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment uh primarily
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
because a lot of language in the
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
original bill that talked about
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
repealing specific boards um and
 
05:08:22.830 --> 05:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
rightfully or not uh we heard from a lot
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the board members that that uh
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
intimidated them so I think the
 
05:08:30.670 --> 05:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh is an improvement to the
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill but I also feel um that we probably
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't need another commission so I'm not
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
sure that I'll be supporting the final
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Brown uh thank you
 
05:08:49.150 --> 05:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair um being being a an
 
05:08:52.830 --> 05:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
first session person I I'm not sure that
 
05:08:55.350 --> 05:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
I would agree because you have a lot of
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
commissions you can't have another one
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I agree with that
 
05:09:02.670 --> 05:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
philosophy if you have a
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
a reason to have a commission that makes
 
05:09:07.230 --> 05:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
sense I don't necessarily agree that you
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
just don't have one because you don't
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
want another
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
one um and then I guess I would if I may
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
05:09:15.600 --> 05:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
follow up on
that

05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the nature of the Beast of this
 
05:09:22.190 --> 05:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislature is people change every two
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
years and and with respect to
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie's comment that is
 
05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
the nature of how it works so you got if
 
05:09:30.190 --> 05:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
you have a commission that goes on for
 
05:09:31.628 --> 05:09:31.638 align:start position:0%
five years it very likely is going to
 
05:09:33.310 --> 05:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
have new people people on it and that's
 
05:09:34.670 --> 05:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
kind of how it's supposed to work I
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
would guess thank
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
you all right I'd like to mention one
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
piece of testimony we got from the
 
05:09:43.320 --> 05:09:44.788 align:start position:0%
piece of testimony we got from the
pharmacy

05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
05:09:48.110 --> 05:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
board they were updating their rules as
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
is necessary once in a while and they
 
05:09:54.670 --> 05:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
found their statutes were so convoluted
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
that they were having trouble with it
 
05:09:59.548 --> 05:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
this has happened before um I completely
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
recodified the statute on licensing
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
05:10:09.070 --> 05:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
investigators and and security agents
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
because that happened we make changes
 
05:10:13.868 --> 05:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
every year as several people have
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned and some of these statutes
 
05:10:19.230 --> 05:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
have been around for a long time and
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
they need to be cleaned up so that it's
 
05:10:24.750 --> 05:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
not entirely clear that the original
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
concern has been met and it's not clear
 
05:10:30.190 --> 05:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
that it's being implemented efficiently
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
I there are so many things things that
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
we do that get amended and tweaked and
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
revised and updated and amended again
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
that we do need to go back every once in
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
a while and say hey let's take a a CLE
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
look at this as a clean slate and figure
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
out are we doing the right thing if we
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
are doing the right thing are we doing
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
it in the best way and I hope that this
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie thank you
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I just you know I don't
 
05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
want to let the work that representative
 
05:11:11.310 --> 05:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
leus did go on noticed and I appreciate
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to do but like I said
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
my one of my big concerns is there's no
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
licenses on this commission and we have
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
businesses we have the medical field
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
represented but no license e thank you
 
05:11:26.080 --> 05:11:30.948 align:start position:0%
represented but no license e thank you
okay

05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chair so I I
 
05:11:37.230 --> 05:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
also salute the tremendous amount of
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
work that uh representative leus has
 
05:11:45.230 --> 05:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
done to defang the original uh possible
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh negative
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
ramifications of what I now recognize is
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
likely to be either called the tedium
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
commission or the air guitar commission
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh because uh this is largely what it's
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to be it's not that it couldn't
 
05:12:06.910 --> 05:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
have some beneficial effect but this is
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of cardboard chewing
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the for the commission but the
 
05:12:15.670 --> 05:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
real negative effect of the commission
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
is it's going to require every
 
05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
profession that the commission takes up
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
to mount a defense of of every aspect
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to waste a tremendous amount
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
of time of the practitioners who are
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to come in and defend
 
05:12:33.520 --> 05:12:34.750 align:start position:0%
going to have to come in and defend
their

05:12:34.750 --> 05:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
profession um so does
 
05:12:38.280 --> 05:12:40.270 align:start position:0%
profession um so does
this

05:12:40.270 --> 05:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:12:43.628 --> 05:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
amendment make an momentous Improvement
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the orig original Bill yes so I
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
salute my colleague uh whom I respect uh
 
05:12:54.548 --> 05:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
but I I predict that uh this is not
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a commission that any
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislator is going to want to serve
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
on there are some of the
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
definitely all right representative
 
05:13:07.628 --> 05:13:07.638 align:start position:0%
leus first of all thank everyone thanks
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
to everyone for their kind words um any
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
commission that's created and there are
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
plenty of them there is the risk that
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
the people on the commission don't do
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
anything um we can't do anything about
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
that but there is evidence there's
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
plenty of commissions that are actually
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing good work um the other thing
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
is um because the commission is is
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
directed to to look at each board
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the people who are licensed
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
from the professions they're not all
 
05:13:37.470 --> 05:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to be there for their
 
05:13:40.350 --> 05:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
meetings when the board's taking up um
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
when the commission is looking at
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
particular boards then you know they
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
would have an interest in coming
 
05:13:48.910 --> 05:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
in um but they don't all have to be
 
05:13:52.150 --> 05:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
there all the time so um the other thing
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
is that you know as I've stated
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
before the purpose of Occupational
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
licensing is to protect public health
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
and safety it is not for the benefit of
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
those licensed now the commission is
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
certainly going to need the input from
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
people who are licensed you know for
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
their subject area of knowledge and
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to be presumably showing
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
up as was mentioned um before the board
 
05:14:18.070 --> 05:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
but having them actually on the uh
 
05:14:20.430 --> 05:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
commission I don't think is appropriate
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason why it's not
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
disrespecting them or accusing them of
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
anything or whatever it's just the
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
nature of the purpose of Licensing that
 
05:14:33.390 --> 05:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that's appropriate
 
05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
um and because the board's supposed to
 
05:14:38.910 --> 05:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
put as I said put out a report on
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
different Commission on different boards
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
then everybody doesn't have to be here
 
05:14:45.070 --> 05:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to do one giant
 
05:14:46.868 --> 05:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
report at the end and there could be an
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity then as in reports come out
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
on boards that legislation could be
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
introduced if that's what the commission
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
recommends thank
 
05:14:54.240 --> 05:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
recommends thank
you

05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative goalie you can get
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
through last last El just briefly mam
 
05:15:05.070 --> 05:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
chair I I disagree with because you're
 
05:15:06.750 --> 05:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
looking at licensing that a license
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be part of the commission um
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of commissions out
 
05:15:12.510 --> 05:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
there where all stakeholders are
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
participating on the commission um it's
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
important that you get views from all
 
05:15:18.510 --> 05:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
sides when you're making those votes um
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
as a commission or a committee um so me
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
and my colleague disagree on that thank
 
05:15:23.160 --> 05:15:25.110 align:start position:0%
and my colleague disagree on that thank
you

05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
okay all right in that case the motion
 
05:15:29.708 --> 05:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
is to adopt Amendment
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
0478 H to house Bill

and then represent thank you madam chair
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I voted against it just kind of
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
protest uh because again I think the
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
ultimate effect of the commission is
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to be a largely a waste of time um
 
05:17:20.910 --> 05:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh and um but at the same time I'm not
 
05:17:23.548 --> 05:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
hostile to the idea that the awful
 
05:17:23.558 --> 05:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
hostile to the idea that the awful
original

05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
original
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
Bill uh in terms of its effect um has
 
05:17:30.910 --> 05:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
been neutralized by the fact that we've
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
amended it it with something that is
 
05:17:36.030 --> 05:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
clearly much much better even if
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
essentially um kind of an air guitar
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
situation uh so I will be voting no on
 
05:17:46.030 --> 05:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
the overall Bill thank you represent
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair it was my
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
great pleasure to work with
 
05:17:52.590 --> 05:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
representative leus and the rest of the
 
05:17:55.868 --> 05:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee on this amendment
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
and um and thank you everybody for that
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
voted to support it and understand those
 
05:18:03.390 --> 05:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
who didn't I wanted to point out two
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
things I did advocate for um two of the
 
05:18:08.830 --> 05:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
board members the one appointed by The
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
Business Association and the medical
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
person be removed from the precluded
 
05:18:18.990 --> 05:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
licensing people so we'd have two public
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
members who were not licensed and then
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
two professional the other two could be
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
um lenses from the professions but um
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
you know so we had a difference of
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and then the when we had the hearing
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the way out after the hearing some of
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
the professional people who took time
 
05:18:44.350 --> 05:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
out of their day to come in and talk to
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
us and to hear the work we were doing on
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
this were very very clear that if we got
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
rid of the repeals and that language
 
05:18:53.070 --> 05:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill that 98%
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
of them would support it so again I just
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
really want to commend representative
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
leus that he heard that and he heard
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
what the people were asking for and he
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
was able to make the amendment at the
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
end of the day I really do um I listen
 
05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
very carefully to the work that se that
 
05:19:12.430 --> 05:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan's doing on his
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee I understand um that for those
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
working committees and commissions it's
 
05:19:20.548 --> 05:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
so hard to get appointments made when
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
they have a stack of appointments
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make because we just
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
keep growing these committees and
 
05:19:27.270 --> 05:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
commissions and I've expressed some
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
concern over that so um I I I probably
 
05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
will be voting no on this bill and
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
hoping another solution can be brought
 
05:19:41.548 --> 05:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
up repr man and thank you madam chair um
 
05:19:43.948 --> 05:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leakas for all
 
05:19:46.510 --> 05:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
the hard work no disregard to all the
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
hard work having served on several of
 
05:19:53.670 --> 05:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
these Commissions in my 12 years as a
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
legislator um I know what it takes the
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
amount of time commitment and um stuff
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
so having done that I still cannot
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
support the amount of time and effort is
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
needed to lift this whole commission up
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the duties are going to
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
be so from that point of view I will not
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
be able to support this bill and um I
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
did thoroughly enjoy working and
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
debating thank you represent Dolan Madam
 
05:20:33.390 --> 05:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
chair um while I I voted in favor of the
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
amendment as I think it made it
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
significantly better I don't think it
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
made it good enough to to support the uh
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh the base bill so I'll be voting no on
 
05:20:44.080 --> 05:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh the base bill so I'll be voting no on
the

05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%

05:20:48.990 --> 05:20:49.000 align:start position:0%

05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
moment uh during this conversation and I
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%

yes n9a 11 n okay the motion fails 9 to1
 
05:22:16.830 --> 05:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
is does someone have an alternate motion
 
05:22:18.670 --> 05:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to um ask for a
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary if I could ask for a
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question if this is not an
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
early bill is it is an early bill it is
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
I believe so
 
05:22:29.958 --> 05:22:32.628 align:start position:0%
I believe so
yes

05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:22:36.510 --> 05:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay because my thought is I do think
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
that having a proactive look at the work
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
that oplc does including the lenses is
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
important I just don't like this vehicle
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
as the means of doing that so if the
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee will entertain this idea I'd
 
05:22:56.400 --> 05:22:57.390 align:start position:0%
committee will entertain this idea I'd
like

05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:23:01.788 --> 05:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
to offer a non-gain Amendment
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
to add the responsibility of this to the
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
oplc oversight committee so that the
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
work is done and I'll work with
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire representative
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
luus and representative goalie who are
 
05:23:18.150 --> 05:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
all on the oversight committee other
 
05:23:21.310 --> 05:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
than me so I'll be glad to address that
 
05:23:24.430 --> 05:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
if the committee and likes that
 
05:23:27.390 --> 05:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
idea for parliamentary question this is
 
05:23:29.548 --> 05:23:29.558 align:start position:0%
in fact an early Bill Brad yes I thought
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
so uh and in that case representative uh
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
groa the appropriate motion would be
 
05:23:35.320 --> 05:23:36.510 align:start position:0%
groa the appropriate motion would be
interim

05:23:36.510 --> 05:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
interim
 
05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
study okay I'll move interim study on
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1676 second repres BR a
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
second by representative
 
05:23:46.718 --> 05:23:48.750 align:start position:0%
second by representative
Schmidt

05:23:48.750 --> 05:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay and you have spoken to your motion
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
you want to add to it I don't want to
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
add anymore I just would like everybody
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
to go home by
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
2:30 you are such an optimist represent
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
GR representative
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
Schmidt uh I think that it's a step in
 
05:24:08.270 --> 05:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
the right direction toward what we all
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
recognize is uh the Paramount importance
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
of having the oplc oversight committee
 
05:24:19.990 --> 05:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
be extremely diligent and effective in
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
improving the oplc which still needs a
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
05:24:26.510 --> 05:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
work just thank you anyone else wish to
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
speak represent LE right just sort of a
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
clarification for some people um by
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing this rather than itl it means that
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
we can consider the amendment uh that
 
05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative groa graciously uh
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
suggested on another bill whereas I
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
think if we itail it we couldn't and
 
05:24:45.990 --> 05:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the big difference
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes or we we could consider making that
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment we could do other things to
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
review the the structure of
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
regulations but it doesn't man it
 
05:25:02.270 --> 05:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't permit it forbid us from doing
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
anything represent Brown thank you madam
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
chair so for my clarification there's an
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that is watching
 
05:25:11.400 --> 05:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that is watching
over

05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:25:12.240 --> 05:25:14.070 align:start position:0%
over
oplc

05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
functions and if this gets into that
 
05:25:16.840 --> 05:25:17.990 align:start position:0%
functions and if this gets into that
oversight

05:25:17.990 --> 05:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee you you would be watching oplc
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're watching over
 
05:25:26.430 --> 05:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
the boards is that what I'm hearing I no
 
05:25:29.070 --> 05:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh depending on what the amendment
 
05:25:31.230 --> 05:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
finally gets worked out it would
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
it could add an extra duty to it to say
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
pick a profession examine the regulatory
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
structure and say do we need to make
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
changes thank
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone else and if I might add
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
it would allow the oplc oversight
 
05:25:52.548 --> 05:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
committee to use existing data that's
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
been generated by audits or other types
 
05:25:59.628 --> 05:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
of information that's been gathered so
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
they become re iCal for all of the
 
05:26:04.548 --> 05:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
information that's been collected so far
 
05:26:07.708 --> 05:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
including performance audits which are a
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
vital tool which we are not using enough
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative uh
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair having uh
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
voted no on the otpa motion I will be
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
supporting interim study uh that's just
 
05:26:28.830 --> 05:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
been proposed I believe that it this
 
05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity to uh
 
05:26:33.788 --> 05:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of the good work that's
 
05:26:38.150 --> 05:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
been done and at least uh consider it uh
 
05:26:43.510 --> 05:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:46.670 --> 05:26:46.680 align:start position:0%

05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
