Troy historical society and the chesher
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
railroad Depot um we would like to thank
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know him and the state of New
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for working with the town of
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
Troy first of all we actually have a
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
temporary use agreement so we were able
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
to um reach that agreement and put our
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
our Bud car on it with the understanding
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
that we would move forward with the
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
purchase of the land itself um and you
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
know they so you guys they helped us um
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
reach that and we were able to place our
 
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839 align:start position:0%
Bud rdc1 uh number 6154 she's was built
 
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.669 align:start position:0%
Bud rdc1 uh number 6154 she's was built
in

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
1957 um and she actually ran the chesher
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
line for a very short period of time so
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
that has historical feature is is next
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
to our Depot now so it's kind of like
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
she's back home um we would respectfully
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
like to ask the state of New Hampshire
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
to sell this piece of property to the
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
town of Troy for $1 um and you find
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
basically a rationale and and the reason
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
for that is the town of Troy purchased
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Cheshire Depot and the property
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
behind this little sliver small piece of
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
land back in
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
1999 since that time the Troy has you
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
know we have maintained the piece of
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
property we have actually mowed it snow
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
removal um trash removal General Lawn
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
Care is needed um this includes paying
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
for the property to be mowed by the town
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
of Troy and we truly value the history
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
of the rail trail and since you know we
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
are actively working to promote it we
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
have a parking area where people come
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
they Park They Ride um we are our
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
Depot's open we are working with several
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
rail trails to put a kiosk um so that it
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
will show a whole map of that area um so
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of things that we're
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
doing in that area to promote the rail
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
trail the safety we work with snow mes
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
we work with est state of the Hamshire
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
um but our Depot like I said is 176
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
years old fully restored one of the few
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the state and actually in the full
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
area to be open to the public back to
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
basically its original way our plan is
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
to restore the the budar and open that
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the public also holding events there
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
book signings we have a lot of local
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
authors that write about the rail trail
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of local authors that write about
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
the the chesher rail trail itself the
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
rail and the history of the of the
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
trains um so with the addition of 6154
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
we've actually now seen non-stop traffic
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
um to the rail trail people walking by
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
looking at it stopping taking a walk
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
that is um our rationale that we would
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
like to continue that in working with
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
the state and and with the snow mes and
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
everybody else to promote the rail trail
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your comments yeah
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr Shay I uh if I could ask you and
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
um institutional memory sitting here to
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
my right I I don't remember coming into
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
many meetings and seeing a request like
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
this at the meeting and not hearing of
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
it before am I
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh no you're not incorrect
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
with that and I would also just like to
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
point out too that the charge of this
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee is to authorize the disposal
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
of property it's not to uh necessarily
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
set the cost of or the what's going to
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
be charged for that property um that's
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
really up to the governor and Council in
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
statute it says that property should be
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
disposed of at market rate which is
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
councel thank you I I guess my question
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the department and for the the town
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
of Troy would you like to
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
postpone um this item to the next
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
meeting um I don't unless I hear
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
something differently I I don't I don't
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
see them going to authorize uh even
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
consider the offer to lower this to$ one
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
so okay what would the pleasure be would
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
you like to move it to the next and see
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
if you could speak to Governor counsel
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
or would you like us to approve or
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
discuss this item and approve it at the
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
rate that's being shown I would just say
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead at this point we're prepared
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
either way we just wanted to let you
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing with the property
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
that we value that
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm appreciative of everything
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
you've told us and the efforts and sure
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
I thank the town for that any further
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions yes Mr one thing the committee
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
could do is wave the um one-time
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
administrative fee if you chose to do
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
that otherwise the they'd still have to
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
pay the $1,100 of which apparently 500
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
has already been deposited with the
 
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.710 align:start position:0%
has already been deposited with the
state

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
um rep M I would not be in favor of that
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
either I think at this point in time
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be in a position where
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
we're setting any kind of historical
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
precedent for any of this that's minute
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sandor did you want to
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
comment if I could Mr chairman there
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
there is a methodology in place where
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
this could be discussed by the governor
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
Council they can make the commitment I
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
think we should move it in in that in
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
that direction rather than doing
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
something here that's that's not
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this committee to do but
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
also recognizing the fact that Troy uh
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
I've only been to Troy a couple of times
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
but I must say I you got to come
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
again I was there for judge Frasier's
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
bachelor party and WHYY Frasier has now
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
been retired for a number of years can
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
say and Troy was a wonderful place to
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
visit so I think with due consideration
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
do has to look at this I think a
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation has to be made by dot to
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to to GNC in order to make this happen
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
but the imperative is
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we're doing a lot to preserve the
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
historical features of of new he that
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
make it such a great place and the
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
community's involvement makes it really
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
worthwhile that it shows a real effort
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
on the part of the people to to maintain
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
the character of of the state and I
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
applaud you for that and thank you very
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
much for that thank you thank you Mr
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you is there any further
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
discussion on item 038 Mr chairman okay
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you question I noticed under
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
requested action it talks about the fee
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
$3,120 uh doar with an one-time
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
administrative fee of $1,100 of which
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
the department is in a receipt of 500 so
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused this 3,120 it
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the rest of the
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
administrative fee and or how does the
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
500 work no the 500 is part of a
 
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
500 work no the 500 is part of a
separate

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
$100 uh administrative fee balance
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
so it I'm so followup so it would be so
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
it would still be
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
3,120 yes sir all right okay good thank
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
