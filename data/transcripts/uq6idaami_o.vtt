00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
sorry for the delay
 
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so before we start I just quickly
 
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
want to address
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
an error I made
 
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
so um I had a member reach out to me to
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
ask to reschedule a bill trying to think
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
of the bill number off the top of my
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
head I thought of the wrong bill
 
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
so it was my error
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
so I rescheduled HB 1431
 
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
when I meant to reschedule HB 1278
 
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
when I meant to reschedule HB 1278
so

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
HB 1431 will be heard end of day
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
February 8th as well as the time to be
 
00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 align:start position:0%
determined on February 8th for HB 1278.
 
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 align:start position:0%
I want to assure everyone there was
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
nothing nefarious going on
 
00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
it was simply an error
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
so with that said
 
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the public hearing on
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.909 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
call up
 
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 align:start position:0%

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
oh so you're going to introduce the bill
 
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
for her
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Mary Jane walner and
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm from Concord you're right almost in
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
my ward so you're just straight away
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
from me so
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
um glad to introduce this bill today I
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
am a co-sponsor
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
and what it sets up is a commission to
 
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 align:start position:0%
take a look at the way
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
we deal with child care
 
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 align:start position:0%
a rep Appeals
 
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 align:start position:0%
this looks at setting up a commission
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
just to study it and I think it's a
 
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
great idea to take a look at something
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
new a new way of doing a new way of
 
00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 align:start position:0%
doing appeals and I think this would
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what other states are
 
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.210 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what other states are
doing

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
take a look at we've been doing it this
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
way I think I was a child care provider
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
for about 50 years and I think we've
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
been doing it the same way for about 50
 
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 align:start position:0%
years so this would just give us the
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at some new
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
ways and some different ways of dealing
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
with appeals for child care providers
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
ago because I remember representative
 
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
mcmilliams coming before us before with
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
a bunch of child care bills and we did
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about the appeals process and
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
the the violations that were going on
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and people felt there was
 
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.969 align:start position:0%
and and people felt there was
um

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh just some
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
I I can't I can't think of the word but
 
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know that it was really impeding the
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
business and causing
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
um problems for the child care centers
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
and to be even to to stay open and
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
um take children was this not something
 
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 align:start position:0%
that was studied during that do you know
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh representative McWilliams can
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
probably answer that better for you she
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
has introduced a number of child care
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
bills in the last couple of sessions and
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
some pieces of those bills have actually
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
passed and other pieces have not they've
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
been amended
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the interesting thing was I was
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
surprised when I looked to see that this
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
was coming to children and family
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
because the other bills have been going
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
to e-dna and you're correct that they
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of a lot of spent a lot
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
of time looking at child care licensing
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
and the issues around license licensing
 
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
and the issues around license licensing
issues

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
so I was surprised it was here so so was
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
I okay
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
right now thank you so much nice to see
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
you all with you nice to see you
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
up next is
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.310 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
barter from the child care advisory
 
00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
is the mic on
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
oh there we go there you go
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
um hi my name is Marianne barter I'm the
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
executive director at Merrimack Valley
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
daycare service and I'm the chair of the
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Child Care advisory
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
Council and I'm in support of this bill
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
and I believe I can answer the question
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
that you had for representative walner
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
when Rebecca McWilliams put together the
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
bill and um different issues were being
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
studied this bill came out of that so
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
something that came up was an idea of
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
looking at the appeals process to make
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
it more fair Equitable for providers
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
and So currently the appeals process
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
that exists for New Hampshire is that if
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
you are given a violation from child
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
care licensing you would appeal back to
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
child care licensing and although we
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't question their integrity they're
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful people and we consider them
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
important allies in our work caring for
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
children it does create an atmosphere
 
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
a provider could feel like there's no
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
point in appealing a decision because
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
they can't win
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
um whether that's true or not I don't
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
know and I have not studied the data but
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
it does create that situation so we feel
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
like this will improve the relationship
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
between providers and childhood and the
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
child care and Licensing Bureau
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that that is
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
exactly the testimony we heard a few
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
years ago when when some of these bills
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
were in front of us from child care
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
providers so thank you for stating it so
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
eloquently thank you all right thanks so
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
much and then up next is Melissa Clement
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
from DHHS child care licensing unit is
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions did you want to
 
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions did you want to
testify

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
can I ask you a couple of questions and
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you I'm Melissa
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
Clement I'm the chief of the child care
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
licensing unit in the Department of
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and we're not
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the bill but we're
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
very happy to have this the issues
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
studied so we can find better ways of
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
doing our work we're always happy to do
 
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
doing our work we're always happy to do
that

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess one of my questions would be
 
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
do you find that the appeals process
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
could be impeding on child care
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents right so if
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.569 align:start position:0%
these facilities
say

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
lose their license for a certain amount
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
of time or while trying to do the appeal
 
00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
of time or while trying to do the appeal
process

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
or how costly it is for child care
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
facilities and that that cost is then
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
passed on to families would that make it
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
more difficult for families in this
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
state to to get child care
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
so um let me walk you through we have
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
two different appeals process so there
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
is an administrative appeals process
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
which is what happens when an
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement action is taken on a license
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
which would be we've just chosen to find
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
a program based on the citations that
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
were found or maybe we've had to do a
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
conditional license or revoke their
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
license or suspended their license
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's a separate process that happens
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
through the administrative Appeals Unit
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
at DHHS this commission my understanding
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
is to study our what is called an
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process and
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
that process is if a program is in
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
violation or we've we've found site
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've cited them for certain violations
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
and when they see the evidence that
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
we've presented on a statement of
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
findings and they feel that they are
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
actually in compliance with that rule
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and they want to present their
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
information to show that we call that an
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process so
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
that is the that is when they make a
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
request to the department for that
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
process and then we look at the
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
information and determine whether they
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
were in compliance at the time maybe we
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
didn't have all the information we
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
needed or that we made some errors maybe
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
in some of our evidence but the overall
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
violation might stand or that we've
 
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.210 align:start position:0%
violation might stand or that we've
removed

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
um the um the citation remains as is
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
because what they presented doesn't
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
change the citation
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that is the process I believe that is
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
meant to be studied under this
 
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
commission so it's it doesn't impact
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
their ability to operate um that would
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
only come through one of those
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
administrative actions which would be
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
heard through the administrative Appeals
 
00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.230 align:start position:0%
heard through the administrative Appeals
Unit

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
Unit
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
not this informal dispute resolution
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
process so for the um informal dispute
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
resolution is that something that um
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
the owner has to be present for
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
um they can submit it either in writing
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
or we've done phone calls we've not now
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
with zoom everyone's gotten comfortable
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
with zoom we've done some meetings that
 
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
way for some historical purposes we've
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
generally do about 10 informal dispute
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
resolutions processes a year we have
 
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.230 align:start position:0%
resolutions processes a year we have
approximately

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
740 licensed Child Care programs in the
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
state and we tend to do about 10 of
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
those informal disputes a year every
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
program gets a visit every year at least
 
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.730 align:start position:0%
program gets a visit every year at least
one

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
and then my final question will be so
 
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.389 align:start position:0%
and then my final question will be so
has

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
has
um

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
your department
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
and perhaps Proprietors of child care
 
00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:43.129 align:start position:0%
and perhaps Proprietors of child care
facilities

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
make changes without having to form a
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission I mean I know that there's
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
been a lot of complaints and I would
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
think that that would
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um incentivize someone to
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know incentivize the department to
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps look into this without us having
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
to go this far you know to where
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
yourself and some Proprietors got
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
together and said hey this isn't working
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
let's see how we can do this has that
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
been something that the Department's
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
thought about so one of the things that
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're looking at what our
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
adult adult license facilities do they
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
have separate processes they have
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
different processes that they do and we
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
have been looking at that we've also
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to other states to see what
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
their processes entails and how they do
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
it there so we have started looking at
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
it but honestly I mean we're not opposed
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
to this commission coming together so we
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
can get even more ideas from other areas
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
that we might not be thinking of perfect
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you Miss Clement the um
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
the informal dispute resolutions
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh 700 programs how many
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
an average per year would there be a
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
finding of a violation
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
almost all programs honestly there's
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
findings we have what we call
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
critical rules which require a
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan and then we have
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
non-critical rules which we know as
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be corrected but
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
a corrective plan a corrective action
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
plan isn't required almost all programs
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
probably receive either a critical or a
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
non-critical rule because of the number
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
of rules that we have
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
so it's the the fact that I said that we
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
have 740 something programs and that we
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
have about 10 disputes a year
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
I would say the vast majority of those
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
programs have received either a critical
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
or non-critical finding
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
so follow up on me so the the critical
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
and non-critical at which point I I
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
remember the issue was uh that some of
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
these day care centers had to stop uh
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
until this was uh you know this was uh
 
00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
until this was uh you know this was uh
adjudicated

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
um so I'm trying to think with respect
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
to critical and non-critical at what
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
point do you may suspend a license or so
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
if I mean suspension revocations are
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
even more rare than the informal dispute
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
resolution process we do I mean I think
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
last year we didn't do any the year
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
before I believe we had one that was
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
revoked prior to that we have you know
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three a year it's very rare
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
that we get to that point and that
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
process goes to the administrative
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
Appeals Unit so it is not part of the
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process so
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
anytime any of programs license is in
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy or there's action taken on a
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
license that goes through the
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit not this
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process this
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
is just for the findings at visits that
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
are requiring corrective action plans
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
and so I have one more question now sure
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
so I mean would you agree that maybe
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
last year and the year before and not
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the years to actually
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah count how many times this has
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
happened I mean if we could get some
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
data from before that I think it would
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
be yeah yeah I believe I provided
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
previous testimony so I can certainly
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
bring that to this community as well
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
great all right thank you are there any
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay so I have no more pink cards so I'm
 
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:31.700 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on HB

good morning again everyone I'm going to
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
um call on representative Cody Lander
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
committee excuse me one second
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
feels like it's right in front of my
 
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.490 align:start position:0%
feels like it's right in front of my
face

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony today
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate it for the record
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Cody bellanger
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
and I represent the center of the
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
you asked my constituents that and I
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
think we might have a brawl
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to provide transparency
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
back into our our Guardian items
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
the story that I'm about to tell you
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
today you probably have heard before or
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I've talked to you about it
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
personally but many of you know that I
 
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:33.140 align:start position:0%
have adopted my nephew
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
and he is now my son
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
the process in which requires that we
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
needed a guardian ad litem
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
the guardian that litem was appointed
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I was not aware of such a cost which
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
was seventeen hundred dollars
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
um on numerous accounts I asked for a
 
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.850 align:start position:0%
um on numerous accounts I asked for a
bill

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
and she never responded
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the statute and I noticed
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
that she's not required to provide one
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
and I said well why the heck is this the
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
case so this is why this bill is before
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
this committee it is a simple tweak
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
so simple
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's not even a full half a page
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
all it does is seek to require the
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem which shall provide an
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
itemized Bill to the paying party and
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
all parties shall have the right to
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
right to have the right to request the
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
itemized bill for review
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's it short sweet simple to the
 
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.349 align:start position:0%
that's it short sweet simple to the
point

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
for that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:36.290 align:start position:0%
for that I'd be happy to take any
questions

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for this bill
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask you can you think
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
of any other service that you get that
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
does not give you an itemized bill
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
nope I don't think so thank you
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay well I have no more pink cards
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's the quickest hearing we've ever
 
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.050 align:start position:0%
that's the quickest hearing we've ever
had

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:11.060 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone I'm going to
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee again my name is
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Cody bellanger and I
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
this bill was kind of a thought bubble
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
um of last part of the first session
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.210 align:start position:0%
excuse me
um

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:10.579 align:start position:0%
when I brought forward my bill for
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
adoptions and one of the comments that
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
got brought up to me was is
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
there a home study done in the first
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
portion of guardianships and the answer
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
is no
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and again going back to my story my
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
wife and I adopted my nephew we filed
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
for Guardianship and we had him form
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
from excuse me
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
August of 2018
 
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and he was
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
our we were his Guardians until August
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
of 2021. so to give you that time frame
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
um in that time window nobody came to
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
visit the house to make sure that he was
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
living in a safe environment now granted
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have a safe environment of course
 
01:03:58.089 --> 01:03:58.099 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
no no individual no dcyf agent No Child
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
Care Agency came out to do a safety
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
check if you will so thought bubble was
 
01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:10.849 align:start position:0%
check if you will so thought bubble was
born

01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
born
 
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
there are some things that I need to
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
address with the child care agencies the
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
dcyf has reached out as you've seen in
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note the intention is not for
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
them to do it as as the fiscal note
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
clearly states they would need to add
 
01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:32.339 align:start position:0%
additional staff
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
um it was kind of
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't really sure and I have reached
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
out to multiple child care agencies and
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
they think this is feasible the the
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
other problem that we're running into is
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
the the cost
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
um as currently the way that the bill is
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
written it states that the 125 dollars
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
would be paid for by the guardian to the
 
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
would be paid for by the guardian to the
courts

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
um but what it what needs to be amended
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I don't have an
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
amendment today but I will be bringing
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
one forward
 
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.730 align:start position:0%
one forward
um

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:03.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the cost will go to the child care
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
agency but the judicial branch will
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
still be allowed to waive as they
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
currently do in the petition process
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
when you are petitioning to be a
 
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.569 align:start position:0%
when you are petitioning to be a
guardian

01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the other concern that was brought up
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
was the term adequate who who determines
 
01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.130 align:start position:0%
was the term adequate who who determines
that

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:24.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
currently the way the process is done in
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
an adoption case is that you have the
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
Child Care Agency come out they do a
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
determination to see if you have a safe
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
home and then it is
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
sent the report is then sent to the
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
court and then the court reads it and
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
then they decide it would essentially be
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the same scenario if you will and that
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
will be the intention so what we want to
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
do is provide the same process the other
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
thing and I'm not entirely sure of as I
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
have not heard back from the child
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
agency agency's child care agencies
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me if 30 days is adequate enough
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
for them to get out there provided that
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
a guardianship has been placed there
 
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:12.380 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment brought forward
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of this week I
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
asked for the request but they did not
 
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:18.380 align:start position:0%
get it back to me in time
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take any
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
questions I know it's a little confusing
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize but you will have the
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.309 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
um so what currently what is what is the
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
if if I might clarify Madam chair you
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
mean for an adoption
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
if that's what this bill refers to then
 
01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.130 align:start position:0%
if that's what this bill refers to then
yes

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
um So currently there is no visitation
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
during the guardianship process so there
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
is no cost
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
but the cost of a home cost of the visit
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
shall be no more than 125 dollars paid
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
for by the guardian the court May issue
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
a waiver for this expense correct
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
currently there's no cost for that
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
correct because there's no process
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's currently being done okay
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
and then uh my next question is when you
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
refer to child care agencies what are
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
you referring to we're referring to
 
01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
um as it states a Child Care Agency
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
approved and licensed by the Department
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services such as
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
Beckett family of services Waypoint
 
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.029 align:start position:0%
Beckett family of services Waypoint
um

01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry those are the only two ones
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
that I know off the top of my head okay
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
further question representative long
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
representative the the
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify on uh the first
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
page 22 the 125 dollars will be paid for
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
by the Child Care Agency is that what
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking to amend that by
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative long and no so the
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
intention will be that the the Guardians
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
will still pay that but they will pay it
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
directly to the agency rather than the
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
way that it's currently written it says
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
paid to the judicial branch and um that
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
was not the intent of the bill Okay so
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the guardian the guardian will play
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
pay directly to the Child Care Agency
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay and the 125 dollars how was
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
that um it's just a placeholder
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
um I saw that yeah I mean I know
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
Waypoint is a thousand dollars their
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
home studies their home study is 1100
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's um that's a bit more of an
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
extensive process I mean you're going
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
through background checks and
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this is just to ensure
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the house is safe knives aren't out
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
um you know you got a pool that's
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
uncovered that the kid could fall
 
01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.490 align:start position:0%
uncovered that the kid could fall
through

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
um if I'm being completely transparent
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
when I first got a kid these were things
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
that I didn't even think of
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and it's just to make sure that the
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
house is safe
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no book about being a
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
parent I mean there are but
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's not easy
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh one more follow-up follow-up so uh
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
and with respect to uh receive a home
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
visit are there different
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
kinds of home visits should this be
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
defined as to what your
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
looking for whether you know it's a high
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
end or a low end or
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
a I mean a home visit
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's not detailed as to what that would
 
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.249 align:start position:0%
it's not detailed as to what that would
be

01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:29.930 align:start position:0%
be
so

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the question
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that was
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
suggested was that we take a look at the
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
adoption statute and see what is said I
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
definitely don't agree that we need an
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
entire adoption statute essentially
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
applied but I do agree that the home
 
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:45.980 align:start position:0%
study should
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
kind of be outlined as to what the
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
expectations are
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
um and again that's going to be the the
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
cost analysis and what's that what that
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost is going to be for for Waypoint or
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
other services that would be doing this
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
okay and uh one more if I may sure uh
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
the um so
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass if if a if
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
a grandparent received guardianship
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
this would require the grand Prime to
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
pay for a home study correct
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
correct but but again they'd be able to
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
file for that waiver
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
when they're filing for guardianship at
 
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Blanchard
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
um as someone who has gone through the
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
adoption process three times
 
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.610 align:start position:0%
adoption process three times
um

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
there's no that blows my mind that
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that you can just take a
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
kid and be like okay this is my kid and
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
no State services
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
have to come in
 
01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.250 align:start position:0%
have to come in
um

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
I mean we had to pay
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
we had to pay for everything with an
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
adoption but they came in
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
in six months they came in six times in
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
six months
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
and we had the privilege of paying for
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that each time they came in and they did
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
like they talked to my my other kids
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
they you know they looked all around my
 
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.530 align:start position:0%
they you know they looked all around my
house

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
um that's mind-boggling that there is no
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know first 60-day you know 90
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
days even to that question oh I'm sorry
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the um so it's it's not set up like
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
the adoption process and that's what
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
you're looking for that it will start
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
looking it will start
 
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.590 align:start position:0%
looking it will start
to

01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um to kind of mimic the adoption process
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
is that what you're talking about
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
that it would mimic a home study but not
 
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.530 align:start position:0%
that it would mimic a home study but not
as

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
as not as big
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes I mean
 
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes I mean
essentially

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
um when we filed for guardianship uh we
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
saw nobody in again 18 to 2021 no one
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
came to visit except for that adoption
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
process which ended up taking place
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
between September and December of 2021
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me
 
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me
um

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
2020 and I apologize
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:26.630 align:start position:0%
um so
um

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
yeah nobody is coming to visit these
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
homes during a guardianship process
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um to to do so so this is just seeking
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
to and again this was brought up last
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
during the first part of the session
 
01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:43.699 align:start position:0%
when I brought forward an adoption Bill
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
many members of this committee were like
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
wait a minute the
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix this adoption piece
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and make it a little easier but there's
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
nothing being done on the front end and
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
I was like oh wow you're right I
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
completely forgot about that part let's
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead and fix that this session so so
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this is trying to do
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
um Rome wasn't built in a day it's going
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
to take a little bit of a process to
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of go through some of these bills
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
through some of these rsas and fix them
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
to kind of mimic but this is an
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
important piece I mean you can't
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
someone who is a gotten guardianship
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
twice and have adopted once
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
it blows my mind that there's no process
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
for someone to come and visit the home
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill seeks to do
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh I totally drew a blanket
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for bringing this forward
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.410 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
um

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
can you describe your amendment that
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
you're planning on just a little bit
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
more and will it include the definition
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
I would I if I may I would
 
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.510 align:start position:0%
I would I if I may I would
um

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
really not want to discuss the amendment
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
until we have it in front of us you know
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
what I mean
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think if you want to ask the
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
question will it include the definition
 
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
of home study would be you know a good
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
question but I really I really feel it's
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's kind of jumping putting the horse
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
before the cart before the horse to
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking about an amendment that's not in
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I can I ask Will it include
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
the home study definition your planned
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that we don't have
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so um it wasn't going to but as to
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Long's point it should
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
and and to yours as well um and thank
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
you for the question sorry I'm trying to
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
jump the gun here talk about putting the
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
um when I get it back I will ask for
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
clarification and that'll be one of the
 
01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
first things that I do this evening
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
instead of going and taking care of my
 
01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.330 align:start position:0%
instead of going and taking care of my
sleep

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Belanger in
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
um you have in the event that the home
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
is neither and the three words I'm
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
focusing on here are safe or adequate
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
and in RSA
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
436 under definitions neither safe nor
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
adequate are defined do you
 
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.630 align:start position:0%
adequate are defined do you
um

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
would you be open to
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
putting the definitions in your
 
01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.729 align:start position:0%
putting the definitions in your
Amendment

01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schiller
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question
 
01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question
no

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
but because not because we're we don't
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
want to uh it's more so the fact that in
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
the 469 it's not stated so we want it to
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
mimic the well as I'm a only sponsor on
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill I want it to mimic the the
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
adoption statute and allow you know
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
adding in the either safe or adequate
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
really kind of leaves that up to
 
01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.110 align:start position:0%
really kind of leaves that up to
um

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
personal opinion
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.649 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
taking my second question
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the fiscal note
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a significant
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
much more than 125 dollars would cover
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
because it looks like
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Youth and Family
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
Services will be required to
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
do a home visit or sub out a home visit
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
write a report on that home visit submit
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
it to the court and then it says that
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
whoever performed the home visit is also
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
required to appear in court so
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
um based on how many
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
Foster placements because that's what
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is what this deals with
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
specifically right is the Foster
 
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.430 align:start position:0%
specifically right is the Foster
placements

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
guardianship placements my bad sorry
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
guardianship placements we do have a
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
number on how many guardianship
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
placements we've had
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years to get
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
kind of an average
 
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.930 align:start position:0%
kind of an average
um

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
has there been have you had any more
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
information come to you since this was
 
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.149 align:start position:0%
information come to you since this was
printed

01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
printed
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
from those agencies to give us an idea
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
of what we would be needing to
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
supplement their budgets with to make
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative um so as I stated earlier
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
I do agree that it should be
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
currently the adoption process is that
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
in a child placing agent a Child Care
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
Agency such as Waypoint or Becca Family
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
Services does an adoption
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
um home study
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and the intention would be for them
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
to also do this piece of it I believe
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
the intention will be within 90 days and
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and if I may preface that as well I
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
don't think in the adoption statute of
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
the home study process that there is a
 
01:18:43.689 --> 01:18:43.699 align:start position:0%
cost limitation
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
so we can always remove this cost
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
analysis completely and it doesn't limit
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the agency and
 
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.790 align:start position:0%
the the agency and
hope

01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
charge for a simple home study which is
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be far less than what would be
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I just want to add to if I may Madam
 
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.070 align:start position:0%
and I just want to add to if I may Madam
chair

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
um when you file for Guardianship and
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I the the adoption the the process
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
for a guardianship visit is going to be
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
different than the adoption visit is
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
when you file for guardianship you must
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
also give a um you must sign a document
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
for a background check and I do believe
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's been a while
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
um a child abuse and neglect document as
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
well so when you file the guardianship
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
paperwork that's already filled out and
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
background check if you will and I'm
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
putting it in air quotes that's the
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
current process now so you wouldn't need
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
to add that to
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
this part of the the home study wouldn't
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
be necessary because it's already being
 
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.490 align:start position:0%
be necessary because it's already being
done

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.209 align:start position:0%

questions

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
all right sing none thank you so much
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%

one and only pink cards so I'll be
 
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on HB 1518

01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
we are now ready to open the public
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 1303 and I will recognize

um

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
um
HB

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
1303 is merely housekeeping
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.270 align:start position:0%
the current
um

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:17.540 align:start position:0%
the current RSA
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
458 if you go to
 
01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
458 if you go to
um

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral seven
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
it states
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
when either party is
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
an habitual drunkard and has been such
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
for two years together that language is
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
very archaic obviously
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
and in today's Times uh we have other
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunate issues so that's why this
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill changes it to state
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
when either party habitually abuses
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
alcohol or drugs
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
and has been doing so for two or more
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
years together that's all it is is it's
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
changing the verbiage to bring it up to
 
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.610 align:start position:0%
changing the verbiage to bring it up to
date

01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you so much
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm an absolute failure on
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
scheduling today oh wait wait there's a
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
question representative also sure yes
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry I was calling up the
 
01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.750 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry I was calling up the
RSA

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
to compare I'm sorry I was a little slow
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
on that one um thank you very much for
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
where you have changed where either
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
party habitually abuses alcohol or drugs
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
and has been doing so for two or more
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
years just together
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
synonymously go with consecutively and
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
yes and if someone has engaged in some
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
um treatment program but then
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
subsequently fallen out of that program
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
and relapsed does it start to clock over
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm like yes so it would be that's why
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
we specifically kept the words two years
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
together be simply because uh if you
 
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
look at rehab and
 
01:35:25.689 --> 01:35:25.699 align:start position:0%
what happens with people who try rehab
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
many times
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
it takes a few efforts to get there so
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
if a person is is habitually abusing for
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
two years together and then they go to
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
rehab and they're in rehab for x amount
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
um they have not been habitually
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
offending or or in imbibing for whatever
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
time they were in rehab
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
so the clock is going to start over it's
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's unfair to do it in any other way as
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming
 
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
that I don't know where it falls in this
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
section that the the starting of that
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
clock so that there is an accurate like
 
01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
it's been this long
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
um is done by the courts so something
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
would have to be submitted right saying
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
like yes I have engaged in this program
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth yes
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
and does that need to be stated or is it
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
just implied
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be implied it would
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
go to the judges
 
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.310 align:start position:0%
go to the judges
um

01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%

representative Belanger do you have a
motion

01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
I do Madam chair I make a motion OTP
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative D Simone
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.139 --> 01:40:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
1520

01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
1520
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
relative to procedures for guardian of
 
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:14.450 align:start position:0%
relative to procedures for guardian of
items

01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
you want me to go get you one up there
 
01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.169 align:start position:0%
hi hi
um

01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
so my concern with this bill is that it
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't really seem to
 
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.290 align:start position:0%
doesn't really seem to
um

01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it's going to actually
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
help the person it seems to me could
 
01:41:53.639 --> 01:41:54.590 align:start position:0%
help the person it seems to me could
just

01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
rendered or Services
 
01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
regarding you know guardianable item
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
process and so how specific they need to
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
be about
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
um you know what they're doing doesn't
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think that this
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
I think yeah I am not sure that this is
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
actually going to
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
result in them saying okay we need you
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
know I showed up at this place for 15
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
minutes and we're gonna charge you 200
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
but I think that that is what the word
 
01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.450 align:start position:0%
but I think that that is what the word
itemized

01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
itemized
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
right refers to am I am I correct that's
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's how you get an itemized bill from
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
a from a gal is they have to put that in
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
there and and I mean
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
if if we pass this and then find out
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's being done like that then I think
 
01:42:55.609 --> 01:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
we can go but I I don't think we need to
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
do that I think itemized
 
01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:59.689 align:start position:0%
do that I think itemized
really

01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
but we also didn't have any people any
 
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.090 align:start position:0%
but we also didn't have any people any
gaals

01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
gaals
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
um testify as to what a bill like this
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
would look like well that's their fault
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
they had every opportunity to come and
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
testify you know what I mean
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
um representative Belanger wants to say
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
something if if I may Madam chair
 
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.970 align:start position:0%
um so uh
this

01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:29.689 align:start position:0%
this
um

01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
this this isn't being done at all
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and that's what this seeks to do
 
01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
um and that's what this seeks to do
um

01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know obviously I'm privy to it and I
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
have personal
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
personal experience with it but
 
01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:43.669 align:start position:0%
personal experience with it but
um

01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
when when I send for my business when I
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
send a bill I send it itemized it shows
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
the flat rate it shows the gratuity that
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
a customer is paying if it's on the card
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
it shows the fuel surcharge which is
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
five percent and then it shows what the
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
total bill is at the end of the trip
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's an itemized bill and if I don't
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
send that and I just send the customer
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
um the the total charge I nine out of 10
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
times they just go what was I charged
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
for and they want a breakdown and that
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
brings fairness to
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
to this and I think it would also with
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
it saying itemized you could bring to
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
the judge's attention is this what they
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
consider itemized right I mean
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
I just I really think that itemize
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
speaks to itself and and is going to
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone thank you madam
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
chair I think that the fact that there's
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
not one
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ad Litem in this room and they
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
haven't sent any emails either speaks to
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I agree so as far as I'm concerned
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
the concern is the constituent who has
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
to pay these bills and itemized
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think the language can get any
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
chair so right now the guardian
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
enlightened says uh 1700.
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
right because that's the bill you get
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
somebody would get for God itemized
 
01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:27.169 align:start position:0%
somebody would get for God itemized
means

01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:27.179 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
I traveled this far to here for gas I
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
visited these participants for an hour
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
for a half hour
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
or or just visited at least at least
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's broken down as to what the guardian
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
enlightened did has paying for that
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
I at least want to know that you put in
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the effort that you you visited the
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
people that you ought to be visiting so
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this itemized bill
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
no doubt it's more than what they're
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
getting now
 
01:46:06.719 --> 01:46:07.510 align:start position:0%
getting now
um

01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
isn't is it
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
correct that really the the guardian at
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
Litem is there to serve the court to
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
gather information for the court and so
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
if they their report to the court was
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
not adequate then the it would be the
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
courts that would say hey you're not
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
really doing your job here
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and the person paying for it really
 
01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
is not the person that is
 
01:46:37.619 --> 01:46:39.310 align:start position:0%
is not the person that is
um

01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
really judging their their work product
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
if that
 
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
well I think this could offer up the the
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
questions to the judge hey this didn't
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
happen or or what is this but people
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
have a right to know what they're paying
 
01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.890 align:start position:0%
have a right to know what they're paying
for

01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
I think that's basically what it is
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
you're getting a service and you have
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
the right to get an itemized bill that I
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
can't think of one instance that you
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
don't get an itemized bill from someone
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
for a service is rendered and why this
 
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
so that's where I'm at
 
01:47:18.719 --> 01:47:20.090 align:start position:0%
so that's where I'm at
okay

01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'll ask the clerk
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%

so

01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%

and I'll just say that I I spoke with
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.530 align:start position:0%

01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
um she agrees that we're concerned that
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
the time frame of this is not actually
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
enough time and we don't want to
 
01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.129 align:start position:0%
enough time and we don't want to
shortchange

01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
shortchange
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
this study which is uh really needed so
 
01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:35.699 align:start position:0%
she agreed with me that we could uh
 
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
bring it back next year and I actually
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we are not just changing
 
01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.290 align:start position:0%
so we are not just changing
um

01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
drunkard to alcohol use or abuses
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol we're also adding drugs and I
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
think that gets us more down this line
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
of like
 
01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:53.060 align:start position:0%
um trying to
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
have fall to no fault and all of that
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
where I think we probably should just be
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
moving more towards no just no fault to
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
not trying to prove it
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
um in in a court of law so I'm not sure
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
that this is moving Us in the right
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
direction it
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
um if if if we were to say that this is
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
just a house cleaning bill then I think
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
that we should have removed the ore
 
01:52:18.119 --> 01:52:19.669 align:start position:0%
that we should have removed the ore
drugs

01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:52:21.609 --> 01:52:21.619 align:start position:0%
part because then we wouldn't be
 
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
we need to include this because
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
drug abuse is
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
a serious issue and that's why it's
 
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
being added when we get to the no fault
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to co-sponsor or sponsor a
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:56.219 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair members of the
 
02:02:47.099 --> 02:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
committee

02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
I agreed to introduce this bill uh and
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
submit it this year although it was
 
02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
submitted uh last year last term by uh
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh kind of got lost
 
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
in the covid stuff I think
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
um but I have personal experience with
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with here and I it's
 
02:03:09.649 --> 02:03:09.659 align:start position:0%
very important to me that we we write a
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
situation that I see as as wrong
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
so with this bill is seeking to do is to
 
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that the division of assets
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
remains a process of being fair and
 
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
making both parties whole and not being
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
used as an act of Revenge or uh
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
basically uh malice
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I was unaware until I went through my
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
divorce three to four years ago that a
 
02:03:38.089 --> 02:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
judge in the Family Court can just order
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
you to sell something that you own even
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
if it's been in your family for
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
Generations if they want to equalize
 
02:03:44.639 --> 02:03:45.649 align:start position:0%
Generations if they want to equalize
assets

02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
assets
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
in my specific instance I had a
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
truck that I owned she had a car that
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
she owned and then I had my motorcycle
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and the judge ordered that in order to
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
equalize the value between the truck and
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
her car which was a known value we had
 
02:04:01.609 --> 02:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
estimates done on the truck estimates
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
done on the car Blue Book values were
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
known so we had the known gap between
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
them was three thousand five hundred
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
dollars and he said you must sell the
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and then give the first three
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars to her and
 
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
I said your honor I have three thousand
 
02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars can't I just give
 
02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
her three thousand five hundred dollars
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
we appealed his decision he denied the
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
appeal to his decision and said no you
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
must sell the motorcycle and give me
 
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
proof that you've sold the motorcycle
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
so I come to you today with this bill
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
that says that if you've got the money
 
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
to make it equal and you want to do that
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
instead of selling a personal item
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
the judge can't order you to dispose of
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
that personal item for me it was just a
 
02:04:43.729 --> 02:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and it wasn't really even a
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic motorcycle it was just my
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycle it wasn't an expensive Harley
 
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
it was just a Honda but
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
um the value between the vehicles was
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
known we knew how much money I needed to
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
get and if I have that money and I can
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
just make it whole and make the the
 
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
division equal without having to sell it
 
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
I should be allowed to that could have
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
just as well been an armoire that had
 
02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
been in my general my family's family
 
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
for generations and generations and it
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
could have been ordered to be sold
 
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
losing a family heirloom
 
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that's just not right that's not
 
02:05:18.890 --> 02:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
what the whole process of of division of
 
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
assets is supposed to be and I think it
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
causes more animosity between the
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
couples in a situation that's already
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
rough so I would rather see uh that we
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
tell the judges you can't do that if
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
they've got the money and they want to
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
just equalize the value let them pay
 
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
and that's all I've got
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for being here today and
 
02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill I'm not familiar with
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
divorces and and I hope that I never am
 
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
divorces and and I hope that I never am
but

02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
so I have a five thousand dollar
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
asset and it needs to be split into two
 
02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's one instance where they split
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
them yep uh
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
and this is just seeking to kind of fix
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
value right like yeah if the value is
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
known and you're looking to divide it
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
then you should be allowed to use cash
 
02:06:26.209 --> 02:06:26.219 align:start position:0%
to make that work not have to liquidate
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
the asset to make it work
 
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:06:33.599 --> 02:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
long

02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:06:36.530 --> 02:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
think of Madam chair uh thank you
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative so when when you when we
 
02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:41.810 align:start position:0%
representative so when when you when we
know

02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
the value uh I'm thinking of when we
 
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't know the value with respect to
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
um it says fairly compensate the other
 
02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
um it says fairly compensate the other
party

02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh for their interest
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
now what if it's a uh a brochure a you
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
know a brooch or whatever that might
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
grandmother was my great great
 
02:07:06.729 --> 02:07:06.739 align:start position:0%
grandmother's uh we don't know the value
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there's
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
actually two values to that one that's
 
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
not addressed by the court which is your
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
sentimental value
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
correct then there's a monetary value
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
that can be appraised by any Jeweler and
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
the judge has arrived at his
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
determination that there's a value to it
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
and like in my case he had assigned a
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
value between the two vehicles after the
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
Blue Book values of the trucks and he
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
knew how much money had to be made up on
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
the case of The Broach uh if it is
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
appraised at a certain value and part of
 
02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
the divorce proceedings is we had to go
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
through our assets and assign values to
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
them and then the other party could
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
dispute what the value was
 
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
or they could accept those values
 
02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
and that's all part of the whole
 
02:07:51.890 --> 02:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
Discovery process in the beginning
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
leading up to things when those get
 
02:07:54.119 --> 02:07:55.850 align:start position:0%
leading up to things when those get
divided

02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
divided
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's when the judge says well I
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
understand this is worth x amount of
 
02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:00.169 align:start position:0%
understand this is worth x amount of
money

02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
and he can turn around and say
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
rather than you keep it and give her
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
money I'm going to make you sell it and
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be allowed
 
02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
my question so is it up to the is that
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the judge's discretion of whether
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
or not you can sell it or is it you have
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
to sell it
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
the judge makes the determination in my
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
instance his order was that I must sell
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
it and when we appealed the order he
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
denied it out of hand and said no you
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
must sell it
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay but it would be up to the judge
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is up to the judge
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
right now and what we're seeking to do
 
02:08:42.530 --> 02:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
is sort of tie his hands just a little
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
bit and say if the money's available now
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with liquidating an
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
asset where the person can't come up
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
with the money such as a home you know
 
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.070 align:start position:0%
with the money such as a home you know
um

02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the money to pay out
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
and equalize it with cash
 
02:08:58.970 --> 02:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
selling it and then dividing the
 
02:09:01.129 --> 02:09:01.139 align:start position:0%
proceeds is the way they usually go
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be used in a situation
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause more Strife
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
between the parties okay thank you for
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative alchiller
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane for taking my
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
question in the statute right now
 
02:09:21.609 --> 02:09:21.619 align:start position:0%
I see that your
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
proposal is to add a section
 
02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.689 align:start position:0%
proposal is to add a section
for

02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:09:26.699 --> 02:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
for
yes

02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.629 align:start position:0%
yes
right

02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:09:29.639 --> 02:09:34.510 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
four it says the court shall specify
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
written reasons for the division of
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
property which it orders
 
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.450 align:start position:0%
property which it orders
so

02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
it would did the court not specify the
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
reasons for
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
the reason given by the court was that
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
the difference in the two vehicles
 
02:10:04.609 --> 02:10:04.619 align:start position:0%
primary Vehicles was three thousand five
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and so they ordered the
 
02:10:08.689 --> 02:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
sale of the motorcycle which was
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
considered a secondary vehicle with the
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
first 3500 I got from selling it to go
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
to her so in that instance their written
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
reason was just the values aren't equal
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
so you must sell it they did not give a
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
written reason as to why selling was
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
imperative or why he refused the appeal
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
to just give cash no written explanation
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
was given and
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam thank you madam chair
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm not seeing anywhere in the RSA
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it says that
 
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh create a bill of sale and purchase
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways of getting around
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
things I ended up selling my motorcycle
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
to a friend and a year later I bought it
 
02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:08.300 align:start position:0%
back again
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
but why should I have to go through that
 
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
if I had three thousand five hundred
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
dollars right there
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and it ended up just causing a lot
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
more animosity during the divorce
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
process because now it was looking like
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you so much
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
and up next is representative Ellen Reed
 
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
honorable members for welcoming me to
 
02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
welcoming me to your committee
 
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
um this bill was originally my bill I
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
put it in last term 2020
 
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
the year it was out of this committee
 
02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on consent oh headed over
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
to the senate in the Senate I believe
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
and was one of the casualties of the
 
02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:08.900 align:start position:0%
mass tabling event
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
so uh this this uh as my testimony says
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
this was originally brought to me by a
 
02:12:19.729 --> 02:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
resident of my County who went through a
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
divorce similar to what you just heard
 
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
from representative Spillane the judge
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
ordered the cell sale of a Sentimental
 
02:12:27.599 --> 02:12:28.669 align:start position:0%
ordered the cell sale of a Sentimental
vehicle

02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
the person offered to give the money
 
02:12:35.089 --> 02:12:35.099 align:start position:0%
directly the cash directly and the judge
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
denied that
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so not knowing a lot about child and
 
02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
family law I wanted to make sure that
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
before I put a bill in on behalf of this
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
person and I was doing my due diligence
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
and making sure I didn't mess anything
 
02:12:53.089 --> 02:12:53.099 align:start position:0%
up so I contacted UNH law school and I
 
02:12:55.689 --> 02:12:55.699 align:start position:0%
asked them is there any reason a divorce
 
02:12:58.729 --> 02:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
judge should be allowed to force the
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
sale of something when the other party
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
has the cash to compensate the other
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
party not a single lawyer at UNH law
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
school could tell me that there would be
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
such a reason nor
 
02:13:11.089 --> 02:13:11.099 align:start position:0%
did that would there be any reason not
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
to to have this in in statute the
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
domestic violence advocacy project and
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
NH legal assistance both reviewed this
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is the same exact language
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
that I used last term
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
and both organizations found no reason
 
02:13:27.370 --> 02:13:27.380 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
so with that I felt safe enough to
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
proceed forward with the language
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I presume I'm you know kind
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
of preaching to the choir here when I
 
02:13:40.330 --> 02:13:40.340 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
divorce judges are instructed in law to
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
um to determine the Equitable division
 
02:13:48.490 --> 02:13:48.500 align:start position:0%
of marital
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
marital property so that's what their
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
instructions are and if someone is able
 
02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
to fairly compensate that cash amount
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
that the judge has ordered and yet the
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
judge says no you have to literally get
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
rid of your property that you have a
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
Sentimental attachment to that doesn't
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
benefit the other party at all it's just
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
punitive and in that case I feel that
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
the judges are overstepping their um
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
their directions in kind of punishing
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
someone just by making them give up
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
something that they are sentimentally
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
attached to
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer questions I have
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
several references that I've included on
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
my because I did do my research last
 
02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:30.770 align:start position:0%
my because I did do my research last
time

02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you so much thank
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
you so much okay and that will conclude
 
02:14:45.649 --> 02:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 1103
 
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
yeah the only thing about executing is
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to exec so some people
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
may be looking online
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
I I get it that if we can exact and we
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
all agree let's get it off our table
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
however there's members that are
 
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
streaming in uh for whatever reason why
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get down here
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
um where they're not going to be on the
 
02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.889 --> 02:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
I mean if we if we could exec the bill
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members my name is
 
02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
Barbara Griffin and I am a
 
02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative from Goffstown I propose
 
02:32:52.750 --> 02:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
and ask for your support for
 
02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
hb118 this bill proposes to add a fact
 
02:32:58.969 --> 02:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
to be considered by the court and in a
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
determination of parenting
 
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
responsibilities where a parent has died
 
02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
or a guardian who has held the position
 
02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
for two or more years has died and the
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
fact that I'm asking to be considered is
 
02:33:15.469 --> 02:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
the contact that the child has had with
 
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
the surviving parent
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
and the wishes of the guardian in estate
 
02:33:22.849 --> 02:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
planning documents again the period to
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
be considered after two years
 
02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
I bring this legislation because of my
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
years of practice as an attorney in a
 
02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:31.979 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem and particularly in
 
02:33:34.849 --> 02:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
the past two years the need to consider
 
02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
this fact has become apparent
 
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
before I get into that I've been
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
practicing since 1987 have held a
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
license in Massachusetts for many years
 
02:33:46.849 --> 02:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
currently hold a license in New
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have a master's in social
 
02:33:50.809 --> 02:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
work from Boston University I've
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
conducted a criminal and civil jury
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
trials I've appeared before The Supreme
 
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
Court but over the last decade plus I
 
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
have focused my practice on family law
 
02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
matters in that role as attorney and
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem I have seen the number
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
of termination cases rise
 
02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
and they have risen specifically over
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years due to covet
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
children are being exposed to the issues
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
of covid outside of the issue of
 
02:34:24.770 --> 02:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
exposure to covet and from a child's
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
perspective that is what had become a
 
02:34:30.349 --> 02:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
very frequent topic of discussion of
 
02:34:30.359 --> 02:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
very frequent topic of discussion of
death

02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
death
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
and children like stability and I was
 
02:34:37.490 --> 02:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
finding a lot of clients people bringing
 
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
forward petitions who when asked why are
 
02:34:41.690 --> 02:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
you bringing this forward the response
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
was that the child in their care wanted
 
02:34:46.370 --> 02:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
to know what would happen if anything
 
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
happened to the person they recognized
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
as their caretaker and that caretaker
 
02:34:54.410 --> 02:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
realized that they had no ability to
 
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
have any say in what would occur should
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
they die
 
02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
so children themselves may or may not be
 
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
subject to Parenting orders and when
 
02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
they are they may have a contact only
 
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
with one parent not due to any court
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
orders but actual practice and I've run
 
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
into that in a number of cases and have
 
02:35:19.969 --> 02:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
currently in a pad terminations where
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
the other parent has simply been absent
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
so the question in the determination in
 
02:35:28.730 --> 02:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
those cases is clearly just one of best
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
interests and are the facts there to
 
02:35:33.889 --> 02:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
allow the court to enter the termination
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
children can also be with guardians
 
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes they are family members
 
02:35:40.250 --> 02:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes they are not and have little
 
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
or no contact with the parents who may
 
02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
or may not still be in the area and
 
02:35:48.349 --> 02:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
these Arrangements do go on and on for
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
years I have been in the home of
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
grandparents who have served of
 
02:35:53.929 --> 02:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
Guardians maybe a child at substance
 
02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
abuse issue they consistently vote Voice
 
02:35:59.090 --> 02:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
the hope that the child will someday
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
become competent to parent and Conquer
 
02:36:03.370 --> 02:36:03.380 align:start position:0%
their drug addiction
 
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
and I frankly in all of the cases I've
 
02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
had any follow-up that has not happened
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the grandparents or other Guardians
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
have gone on to become the lifelong
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
guardians of that child so it does
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
happen for many reasons
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
and as I stated earlier with kovid
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a generation of children who
 
02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
have become directly confronted with the
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of death in either
 
02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or their caretaker because it
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
was flat out part of the whole school
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
thing that went over was that everybody
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
was so sick and might die and you
 
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't go out so it did become a very
 
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
real fear for children who are often in
 
02:36:42.290 --> 02:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
situations that aren't providing the
 
02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
greatest stability to begin with
 
02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so it really did have an impact
 
02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
so whether or not that exposure to the
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
issue of death for due to covet was an
 
02:36:57.290 --> 02:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to be exposing
 
02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
children is is really a question for
 
02:37:02.290 --> 02:37:02.300 align:start position:0%
another day the reality is it happened
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they were asking their caretakers
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
what are gonna what's gonna happen if
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
you die
 
02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
I had a Guardians say they were on a car
 
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
ride they were in the car I mean as a
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
parent you know I'm sure many of you
 
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
that some of the the darndest things get
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
said from the back seat of an automobile
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
right and that comes up so at that point
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the reality that a biological parent who
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
may or may not be able to parent and who
 
02:37:30.670 --> 02:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
may or may not have had any interests
 
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
becomes essentially the legal winner in
 
02:37:36.410 --> 02:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
what may occur if there's a death in
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
what is the caretaking parent or a
 
02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:40.370 align:start position:0%
what is the caretaking parent or a
guardian

02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
um and again I come back to the fact
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I've I along with other Guardians
 
02:37:46.969 --> 02:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
have had more terminations in the last
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
two to three years than we have during
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
our entire practice years and uh the
 
02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
compelling reason has been that a
 
02:37:55.849 --> 02:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
caretaking Arrangement has been in place
 
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the reality of the what a death
 
02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
would do to it has become apparent
 
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
um now whether or not parents are
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
involved or not involved or the bill
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
goes forward or not whether it's good in
 
02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:10.979 align:start position:0%
a particular circumstances not what this
 
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to do
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill tries to do is to allow
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the court to consider what other options
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
might be appropriately available in the
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
consideration of entering parenting
 
02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.929 align:start position:0%
consideration of entering parenting
orders

02:38:23.929 --> 02:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
while the best parent best interest
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
standard may include a lot we know that
 
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
persons disagree on what it should
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
include and what weight it should be
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
given what I am asking you to do is to
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
ask the court to require to a
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
consideration of The Wishes of a
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
deceased garden guardian or the actual
 
02:38:49.010 --> 02:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
contact a parent may have had
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
um the two years selected was not
 
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
entirely arbitrary I do a lot of dcyf
 
02:38:56.809 --> 02:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
cases and in those cases of course the
 
02:38:59.330 --> 02:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
presumption is that a parent has a year
 
02:39:02.090 --> 02:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
in order to correct the conditions that
 
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
led to the finding of abuse or neglect
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
at which point the court is required by
 
02:39:09.849 --> 02:39:09.859 align:start position:0%
federal law to issue permanent orders
 
02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
the reality is those abuse and neglect
 
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
cases by virtue of the calendar pretty
 
02:39:17.570 --> 02:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
much all go more than a year and I've
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
had cases where the year which starts at
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
the finding not the initial hearing has
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
gone on for almost another year by
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
virtue of trying to give that parent an
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to assume this get the
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
skills that would allow them to become
 
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
apparent so in abuse and neglect the the
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
legal standard is a year two years is
 
02:39:39.889 --> 02:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
really sort of where you get to see that
 
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
a parent is going to be able to go down
 
02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
the path of Rehabilitation and assume
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
the care or not and in a guardian
 
02:39:49.010 --> 02:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
situation as I said many of them start
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
off with the view that they will be
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
temporary right the child who's the
 
02:39:54.650 --> 02:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
parent is going to be able to remedy the
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
situation or will come back right
 
02:39:59.870 --> 02:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
they've moved away so we've assumed the
 
02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
care of maybe someone who's not a family
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
member in order to continue that
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
relationship but when you get to be two
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
years you've established a new reality
 
02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
for children in regards to their
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
stability and what should happen so
 
02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's where the two years came from and
 
02:40:21.290 --> 02:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everybody that as
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
an attorney and any case is constrained
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
by the facts right I mean the facts are
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
what a court has to consider and the
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
clients in their lives are the facts
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
that go before the court
 
02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
and the court is the one who has the
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
ability to consider the facts but
 
02:40:40.370 --> 02:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're constrained by the law so as an
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm constrained is what I can
 
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
do with a client because the client has
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
brought me the facts and that's all I
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to work with and the court needs to
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
be given the opportunity to take those
 
02:40:53.389 --> 02:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
facts and apply the law and I'm in an
 
02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
effort to give the court the opportunity
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
to consider what has become in a
 
02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
two-year situation than normal I've
 
02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
proposed this bill to allow the court to
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
take into consideration either the the
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
intent of Guardians when they have done
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
estate planning documents or what the
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
actual contact has been with the parent
 
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that's going to
 
02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
prohibit a parent from coming in but I
 
02:41:20.690 --> 02:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
would like the court to have to consider
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
it it will give them the ability to do
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
it as compared to someone arguing it
 
02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
should be Irrelevant in light of other
 
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
standards and with that I thank you for
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
your time and I'm happy to take
 
02:41:31.439 --> 02:41:32.809 align:start position:0%
your time and I'm happy to take
questions

02:41:32.809 --> 02:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.650 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
Belanger

02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
Belanger

thank you madam chair and thank you

02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to preface this Madam chair so
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
before you ask me where my question I'm
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to get there I promise okay
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so I have adopted someone and I'm a
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
current guardian of another child if I
 
02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:01.010 align:start position:0%
current guardian of another child if I
die

02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
die
 
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
and my documents state
 
02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
that they go that my guardianship rights
 
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
go to my wife even though my wife is not
 
02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
currently the guardian for this second
 
02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
currently the guardian for this second
child

02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
and I have proven Beyond A Reasonable
 
02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:14.690 align:start position:0%
and I have proven Beyond A Reasonable
Doubt

02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
Doubt
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
that my relative is not able to care for
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
the child in question
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
would this bill allow the parent to
 
02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:30.050 align:start position:0%
would this bill allow the parent to
um

02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
be considered for my guardianship
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
I I guess I need to back up a little bit
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt would not be the
 
02:42:40.610 --> 02:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
standard use in these proceedings as to
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
an adopted child you are the legal
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
custodian so your estate wishes
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
um would control regardless and and your
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
wife or if that other person has not
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
adopted as an attorney when you walked
 
02:42:59.090 --> 02:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
into my office that I'd say why not
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
um but that that would be sorry I just
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
want to the adoption was just to preface
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to the second case where
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm at no no I know but I but you made a
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
certain assumption that we were going to
 
02:43:12.770 --> 02:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
globally possibly globally treat them
 
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
the same and I'm simply pointing out
 
02:43:16.010 --> 02:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
that you've already got a circumstance
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
where even the adopted child would not
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
be treated
 
02:43:21.650 --> 02:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
um there would be some different
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
standards going on your estate planning
 
02:43:26.809 --> 02:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
documents under current law would have
 
02:43:31.250 --> 02:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
no legal effect on a guardian child it
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
might be considered
 
02:43:36.530 --> 02:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
um but there's no requirement for it as
 
02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
you're a guardianship terminates at your
 
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
death or the death of the child and
 
02:43:43.969 --> 02:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
guardianships are always temporary you
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
can get a final guardianship order at a
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
final hearing but the guardianship order
 
02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
itself is temporary and always subject
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
to modification
 
02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
by the parent I will presume given the
 
02:44:00.110 --> 02:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances of most guardianship cases
 
02:44:03.530 --> 02:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
to reopen it as to either parenting time
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
or a termination the only difference is
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
the standard that is used in considering
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether a guardianship is is terminated
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
will be different depending on whether
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
the guardianship entered as a result of
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
an agreement of the parent by agreement
 
02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of time parents agree
 
02:44:24.530 --> 02:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
we can't do it we're going to let this
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
person be guardian or whether the the
 
02:44:28.969 --> 02:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
parent contested the guardianship at the
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
time the guardianship entered finally
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
under this bill if you had done a state
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
planning documents
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
it would be considered as to both
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
children if the adopted child did not
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
have another legal parent
 
02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm presuming with adoption that
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
there was a termination that allowed the
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
adoption and I understand we're talking
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
generally there's no adoption unless the
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
termination has already occurred so that
 
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
parent is legally out of the picture
 
02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
upon your your the adoptive parent dying
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
they're they're no longer in the picture
 
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
whether the adoptive parent is alive or
 
02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:13.610 align:start position:0%
whether the adoptive parent is alive or
dead

02:45:13.610 --> 02:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
dead
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and the issue as to a guardianship
 
02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
then it reverts back to the parents
 
02:45:22.610 --> 02:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
under the current law
 
02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
um in no way prohibit stops a parent
 
02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
from still trying to seek correct to get
 
02:45:33.410 --> 02:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
the child back correct I I can tell you
 
02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:34.309 align:start position:0%
the child back correct I I can tell you
I

02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:45:34.319 --> 02:45:35.330 align:start position:0%
I
um

02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
in Guardian reports for terminations I
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
distinguish often in my reports that
 
02:45:44.090 --> 02:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between what a
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
court in a termination proceeding might
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
do and what occurs in a parenting case
 
02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:50.990 align:start position:0%
do and what occurs in a parenting case
and

02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:51.710 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Griffin
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair uh
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
with respect to child support is that
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
any consideration even though they've
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
been paying child support but haven't
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
had any contact with the child or
 
02:46:15.469 --> 02:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
visitation well we are told in the
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
practice area that child support and
 
02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
parenting are not related
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
so just so you so you know that
 
02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:23.690 align:start position:0%
so just so you so you know that
um

02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
the reality is just for the com if the
 
02:46:28.250 --> 02:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
committee will indulge me child support
 
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
is a consideration and termination
 
02:46:34.929 --> 02:46:34.939 align:start position:0%
so if you the termination
 
02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
factual criteria that a court must find
 
02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
must have been in place for six months
 
02:46:42.889 --> 02:46:42.899 align:start position:0%
in order for a court to find that the
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
facts exist to consider a termination
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and then it considers whether it
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
might be in the child's best interest
 
02:46:52.610 --> 02:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
so factually if a child has if a parent
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
has failed to support
 
02:46:57.050 --> 02:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
pay child support for a child for six
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
years for six months that would be
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
grounds for termination however
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
technically child support is not a
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
factor to be considered in parenting
 
02:47:09.469 --> 02:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
decisions what it does go to is to the
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
ability to provide for a child but the
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
payment of Child Support itself would
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
um and and this is
 
02:47:24.410 --> 02:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
both of these are just
 
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
they shall consider correct it's not a
 
02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
thing you must do you know you must
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
correct yeah they just shall consider
 
02:47:37.250 --> 02:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
correct and my understanding is what the
 
02:47:41.450 --> 02:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
problem is is it correct that uh there
 
02:47:43.969 --> 02:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
may be another you know another uh
 
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
parent comes in correct uh that may have
 
02:47:49.130 --> 02:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
issues and we wait two or three years to
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
see if they can get over that issue and
 
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's what this is addressing yes and I
 
02:47:54.770 --> 02:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
will tell you A lot of times what
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens when there's a parent that
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have contact sort of on the
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
other side so to speak
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not saying this to be
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um to negatively accuse anybody of
 
02:48:08.270 --> 02:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
anything what you find often is is that
 
02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
the party that all of a sudden pays the
 
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
child support becomes involved is
 
02:48:14.929 --> 02:48:14.939 align:start position:0%
actually the parent of the parent or the
 
02:48:14.939 --> 02:48:16.730 align:start position:0%
actually the parent of the parent or the
grandparent

02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
grandparent
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um who has had a grandchild that by
 
02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
virtue of their child not being a parent
 
02:48:24.170 --> 02:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
that they all of a sudden want to get it
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
get involved
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
and you often have parents admitting
 
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
that that's where the money came from or
 
02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
that's how they got the ride or that
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
I mean this is obviously addressing a
 
02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
very unique circumstance where the
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
parents have not
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
been parenting the legal parents have
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
not been parenting so we're so keep in
 
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
mind we're in a pretty
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
um fortunately narrow group of
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances but as the focus on Family
 
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
Matters is more heightened and as
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
termination matters
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
grow I think it's important to give the
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
court the ability to consider a number
 
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
of factors
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank representative alt Schiller
 
02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:49:12.170 --> 02:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
um

02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law could you please
 
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:19.250 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law could you please
clarify

02:49:19.250 --> 02:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:20.349 align:start position:0%
clarify
um

02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:24.170 --> 02:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
why you have chosen the court Shell
 
02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
versus the court may I believe shall is
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
a little more is more emphatic
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh because yes and one of the reasons I
 
02:49:37.849 --> 02:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
did that was I wanted it specifically in
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
the order because the court would then
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
have to enunciate clearly that is in a
 
02:49:45.889 --> 02:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
written order as to whether or not it
 
02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
was considered it would make it clear to
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
parties and litigants that that would be
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
a fact that they might want to prepare
 
02:49:56.809 --> 02:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
for in connection with any trial or
 
02:49:59.510 --> 02:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
consideration of the order and it would
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
also allow if indeed there is a guardian
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
ad litem involved in the case to
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
consider it knowing that the judge had
 
02:50:10.969 --> 02:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
was required to consider it in a final
 
02:50:17.809 --> 02:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.819 --> 02:50:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and that
 
02:50:25.730 --> 02:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
will conclude the public hearing on
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1118
 
04:18:15.250 --> 04:18:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.849 --> 04:18:24.859 align:start position:0%
so official today I got my
 
04:18:29.809 --> 04:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.130 --> 04:18:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.150 --> 04:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
all of ours just have our last name
 
04:19:01.729 --> 04:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:01.739 --> 04:19:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.889 --> 04:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to uh open the hearing on
 
04:19:46.260 --> 04:19:48.530 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to uh open the hearing on
1305.

04:19:48.530 --> 04:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
1305.
 
04:19:51.410 --> 04:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna call uh representative
 
04:20:03.610 --> 04:20:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.050 --> 04:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee again I'm Deborah DeSimone I
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
um Atkinson and Plaistow
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
you don't get much more self than that
 
04:20:26.809 --> 04:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open this bill 1305
 
04:20:26.819 --> 04:20:29.050 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open this bill 1305
referencing

04:20:29.050 --> 04:20:29.060 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
modifying the definition of temporary
 
04:20:34.969 --> 04:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
alimony that a court May award in a
 
04:20:34.979 --> 04:20:36.110 align:start position:0%
alimony that a court May award in a
pending

04:20:36.110 --> 04:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
pending
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
the important word there is pending
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
the reason that we brought this forward
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
is because
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
in a pending divorce case
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
all of the marital assets are not always
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.600 --> 04:21:00.370 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:21:00.370 --> 04:21:00.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:03.410 --> 04:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
given to the court yet
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
or made apparent to the court so in some
 
04:21:10.570 --> 04:21:10.580 align:start position:0%
cases a respondent may require
 
04:21:13.010 --> 04:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony
 
04:21:16.389 --> 04:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
to get him or her through
 
04:21:20.210 --> 04:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
financially the divorce case
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
and in some cases that can be
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
financially detrimental to the person
 
04:21:29.110 --> 04:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
who's paying that temporary
 
04:21:29.120 --> 04:21:30.650 align:start position:0%
who's paying that temporary
alimony

04:21:30.650 --> 04:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
so what we're asking here is
 
04:21:37.250 --> 04:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.809 --> 04:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
unless those formula limits
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
a party seeking the temporary alimony
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
pleads and the court finds that
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
immediate irreparable economic harm
 
04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
would result If the percentage of the
 
04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
formula were applied
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
so it's early on in the divorce
 
04:22:09.290 --> 04:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
proceeding and we don't want
 
04:22:09.300 --> 04:22:11.530 align:start position:0%
proceeding and we don't want
to

04:22:11.530 --> 04:22:11.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
accidentally create irreparable harm to
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
either party
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why this is being brought
 
04:22:20.160 --> 04:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
and that's why this is being brought
forward

04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I thank you
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:22:44.450 --> 04:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.610 --> 04:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:22:46.620 --> 04:22:47.689 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

04:22:47.689 --> 04:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:50.290 --> 04:22:50.300 align:start position:0%
my cons my concern
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so I'm hoping you can address two
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
things is that in their possibly being a
 
04:23:01.370 --> 04:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony
 
04:23:01.380 --> 04:23:03.530 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony
um

04:23:03.530 --> 04:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
finding if that's the is that the proper
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
word or ruling
 
04:23:08.460 --> 04:23:10.510 align:start position:0%
word or ruling
um

04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
while Discovery is still being made is
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
that okay well Discovery is still being
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
made that then
 
04:23:17.399 --> 04:23:19.010 align:start position:0%
made that then
um

04:23:19.010 --> 04:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
it becomes a Baseline
 
04:23:26.090 --> 04:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
that mayor that may be inappropriate
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
is that was that your question was that
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration
 
04:23:33.889 --> 04:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
is that your question that's my first
 
04:23:35.929 --> 04:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you yeah um and it
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't become a baseline it would
 
04:23:43.490 --> 04:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
become specifically temporary until the
 
04:23:46.130 --> 04:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
order would come forward deciding
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
whether they would or would not be
 
04:23:52.370 --> 04:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
alimony and if there is alimony what it
 
04:23:55.610 --> 04:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
would be this is a temporary situation
 
04:24:05.330 --> 04:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.849 --> 04:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
um okay so my follow-up question is
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's often
 
04:24:15.479 --> 04:24:17.389 align:start position:0%
there's often
um

04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:19.490 --> 04:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
parties who will
 
04:24:19.500 --> 04:24:22.309 align:start position:0%
parties who will
make

04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
take actions to hide their assets
 
04:24:25.080 --> 04:24:26.650 align:start position:0%
take actions to hide their assets
or

04:24:26.650 --> 04:24:26.660 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
dissolve assets prior
 
04:24:32.330 --> 04:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
during discovery
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
so how would this address
 
04:24:38.809 --> 04:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
someone who may be hiding significant
 
04:24:38.819 --> 04:24:40.010 align:start position:0%
someone who may be hiding significant
assets

04:24:40.010 --> 04:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
assets
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
well this is not going to address
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
particularly that area however what this
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
is saying is that if you use the formula
 
04:24:55.929 --> 04:24:55.939 align:start position:0%
and it creates a legitimate
 
04:24:55.939 --> 04:24:57.769 align:start position:0%
and it creates a legitimate
legitimate

04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
04:24:57.779 --> 04:24:59.050 align:start position:0%
legitimate
uh

04:24:59.050 --> 04:24:59.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
economic irreparable harmful
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
situation then the current Formula would
 
04:25:07.080 --> 04:25:08.110 align:start position:0%
situation then the current Formula would
be

04:25:08.110 --> 04:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:25:11.929 --> 04:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately you're right people do
 
04:25:15.960 --> 04:25:16.809 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately you're right people do
um

04:25:16.809 --> 04:25:16.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
liquidate and hide assets during divorce
 
04:25:24.530 --> 04:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
proceedings and this is so early in the
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding that it's hard to
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
tell whether they are or are not going
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
to do that so we hope that the court
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
would figure that out however there
 
04:25:37.729 --> 04:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
could be a person in the divorce
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding that deserves and needs the
 
04:25:41.040 --> 04:25:42.170 align:start position:0%
proceeding that deserves and needs the
alimony

04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to devastate the other
 
04:25:44.279 --> 04:25:45.229 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to devastate the other
person

04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:25:48.649 --> 04:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
in in doing that we want both people to
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
have an equitable
 
04:25:50.760 --> 04:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
have an equitable
situation

04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.490 --> 04:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:25:58.500 --> 04:25:59.570 align:start position:0%
excuse me
follow-up

04:25:59.570 --> 04:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:26:03.769 --> 04:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
all right last last one so if when
 
04:26:05.950 --> 04:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
when the court is finding that one party
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:26:09.969 --> 04:26:09.979 align:start position:0%
paying alimony
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
what would the
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
how would if that party is as the court
 
04:26:20.570 --> 04:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
finds to be in a position to be paying
 
04:26:20.580 --> 04:26:22.370 align:start position:0%
finds to be in a position to be paying
alimony

04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
how what would the immediate irreparable
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
economic harm be
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
because it seemed the court is already
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
applying the formula that says they can
 
04:26:32.520 --> 04:26:33.469 align:start position:0%
applying the formula that says they can
pay

04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
pay
 
04:26:36.769 --> 04:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
so like where's the
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
so if it comes to the courts
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
recognition yeah that it's going to
 
04:26:47.530 --> 04:26:47.540 align:start position:0%
cause irreparable harm the formula
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
limits would not be used the court would
 
04:27:02.090 --> 04:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.100 --> 04:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.319 --> 04:27:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.090 --> 04:27:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.570 --> 04:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
you have arrived representative
 
04:27:26.580 --> 04:27:30.769 align:start position:0%
you have arrived representative
so

04:27:30.769 --> 04:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.450 --> 04:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
so with
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the court now uh
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't do a temporary
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
alimony they just
 
04:27:40.370 --> 04:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
saw the higher earner moves out of the
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
house and I'm going to ask you to pay
 
04:27:45.530 --> 04:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
the mortgage until we come to a
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion on this
 
04:27:49.250 --> 04:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so is this
 
04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that no no not at all
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
what this is saying is in in your
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
scenario representative
 
04:27:59.159 --> 04:28:00.649 align:start position:0%
scenario representative
um

04:28:00.649 --> 04:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
they they the one particular party moves
 
04:28:06.050 --> 04:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
out of the house and has to pay the
 
04:28:07.969 --> 04:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
mortgage but the party that's left
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
behind may have been and still is a
 
04:28:12.920 --> 04:28:14.889 align:start position:0%
behind may have been and still is a
stay-at-home

04:28:14.889 --> 04:28:14.899 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
non-working member of the couple
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that person would require
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
or petition the court to require
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony
 
04:28:32.170 --> 04:28:32.180 align:start position:0%
and that's when the court would consider
 
04:28:36.530 --> 04:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
the temporary alimony later on in the
 
04:28:39.290 --> 04:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
court proceedings when they divide the
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
marital assets thus and so that alimony
 
04:28:46.490 --> 04:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
may be part of the Court ruling and it
 
04:28:49.490 --> 04:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
may go away
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to change anything
 
04:28:51.840 --> 04:28:53.210 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to change anything
else

04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:28:56.929 --> 04:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up for me thank you so uh
 
04:28:58.490 --> 04:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
the temporary what you're saying may not
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
be temporary well it will be temporary
 
04:29:02.040 --> 04:29:04.370 align:start position:0%
be temporary well it will be temporary
however

04:29:04.370 --> 04:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:29:07.250 --> 04:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
long that temporary portion will be
 
04:29:11.090 --> 04:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
eventually the temporary will go away
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
then it will be up to the court to
 
04:29:17.450 --> 04:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
decide whether this person gets alimony
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
so so I'm wondering if I mean
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
if I'm a judge I'm seeing that a person
 
04:29:27.479 --> 04:29:28.729 align:start position:0%
if I'm a judge I'm seeing that a person
is

04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
able to pay temporary alimony and
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
plus pay for a lawyer to go through the
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
divorce that after the divorce this
 
04:29:41.450 --> 04:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
guy's got a little more money on
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know you know he's not going to be
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
paying a lawyer anymore
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
so I I thought representative may have
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
asked something contained into that
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
my concern would be
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony be in the
 
04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
um the basis the measure basis for
 
04:30:05.710 --> 04:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
permanent Alma well it may very well be
 
04:30:08.570 --> 04:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
if the person doesn't have the
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rehabilitate him or
 
04:30:15.769 --> 04:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
herself and be able to become gainfully
 
04:30:15.779 --> 04:30:17.090 align:start position:0%
herself and be able to become gainfully
employed

04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
employed
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
this person for whatever reason may
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
fall under the parameters of becoming an
 
04:30:27.290 --> 04:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
alimony recipient
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of the divorce
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
again the temporary portion would have
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
no bearing on the ultimate outcome
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
it could be that this person needs
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative alimony which is another
 
04:30:42.540 --> 04:30:44.090 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative alimony which is another
statute

04:30:44.090 --> 04:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
it could be that this person needs
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
lifelong alimony
 
04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the court to
 
04:30:52.490 --> 04:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
determine that
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:30:57.680 --> 04:31:00.170 align:start position:0%
any other questions
[Music]

04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
I have some
 
04:31:02.220 --> 04:31:04.689 align:start position:0%
I have some
um

04:31:04.689 --> 04:31:04.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
in in the statute right now it says that
 
04:31:11.929 --> 04:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
there is a maximum duration of alimony
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
shall be 50 of the length of the
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
marriage unless the parties agreed
 
04:31:17.530 --> 04:31:17.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise or the court finds that are
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
Justice requires an adjustment
 
04:31:22.370 --> 04:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:31:22.380 --> 04:31:23.510 align:start position:0%
to that
um

04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
and in your bill you cross out the
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
online five you're Crossing out that
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
this temporary alimony shall not be
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
counted towards the uh essentially the
 
04:31:40.370 --> 04:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
five years of or fifty percent of the
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
time of the regular alimony however
 
04:31:49.250 --> 04:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
this temporary alimony may be
 
04:31:52.490 --> 04:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
a different amount than would be
 
04:31:54.649 --> 04:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
required on the norm under normal
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
alimony so if this temporary alimony was
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
for let's say a year and it was
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
50 percent less than the final Judgment
 
04:32:10.130 --> 04:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
of alimony than the person that got
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
the alimony
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh judgment would be essentially have
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
this temporary alimony would have
 
04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
counted toward their 50 of the time in
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
their marriage so they would have lost
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
that 50 percent of the
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
um what their alimony would have been
 
04:32:31.210 --> 04:32:31.220 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:32:33.729 --> 04:32:33.739 align:start position:0%
for what reason
 
04:32:35.530 --> 04:32:35.540 align:start position:0%
were you
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to change
 
04:32:38.520 --> 04:32:39.130 align:start position:0%
wanting to change
um

04:32:39.130 --> 04:32:39.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
this from not being counted towards that
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
because we want the temporary alimony to
 
04:32:53.520 --> 04:32:54.530 align:start position:0%
because we want the temporary alimony to
be

04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
temporary and not counted toward any
 
04:33:00.889 --> 04:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's just temporary until the judge can
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
make its the court can make its
 
04:33:11.449 --> 04:33:11.459 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether this person
 
04:33:15.769 --> 04:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
should get alimony or should not
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
and this is really more about
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
not creating irreparable economic harm
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your clarification but the
 
04:33:37.131 --> 04:33:37.141 align:start position:0%
the language that I'm specifically
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
referring to is such alimony shall not
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
be counted toward or subject to the
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
duration limits of RSA 458 19a Roman 3
 
04:33:51.170 --> 04:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
but you're changing it to it
 
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to the duration
 
04:33:56.209 --> 04:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
limit so in fact you're actually saying
 
04:33:59.449 --> 04:33:59.459 align:start position:0%
that that it's not going to be it can be
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
counted towards it and it the duration
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
limit can even be longer than the
 
04:34:07.609 --> 04:34:07.619 align:start position:0%
current one well it depends upon how
 
04:34:07.619 --> 04:34:14.570 align:start position:0%
current one well it depends upon how
long

04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
are the reasoning there we know that
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to court for your divorce is
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
taking longer and longer and it could
 
04:34:28.250 --> 04:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.250 --> 04:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
so is it my understanding that you would
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
want the all of that 10 years to of
 
04:34:36.830 --> 04:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony to be going against
 
04:34:36.840 --> 04:34:38.330 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony to be going against
their

04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:34:40.849 --> 04:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
um 50 percent of the length of the
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
marriage so if they were married for 20
 
04:34:43.680 --> 04:34:44.869 align:start position:0%
marriage so if they were married for 20
years

04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:34:48.109 --> 04:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
then after the 10 years and they finally
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
get divorced they would actually be done
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.609 --> 04:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
unless the party would be economically
 
04:34:58.619 --> 04:35:01.131 align:start position:0%
unless the party would be economically
