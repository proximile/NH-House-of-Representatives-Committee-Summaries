issue for our time and the decline
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
in the bee population and in the local
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%

dramatic
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
and many many states are working on this
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
subject right now to try to limit
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
the use of the toxic pesticides to
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
so that they can regrow their
 
00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
so that they can regrow their
environment

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
environment

on this legislative step can bring all
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
in so that we can craft a good bill
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%

representative pearl
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah madame sierra
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
i am not in favor of moving this bill
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
forward and i
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
for many reasons but you're going to
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
find a common theme with all four of the
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
bills coming up that
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
we were our caucus was concerned with
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
these bills were all supposed to be put
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
into a study committee and
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know we'd agreed to do that we had
 
00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
you know we'd agreed to do that we had
concerns

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
of of our own as well as other concerns
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
that were raised during the hearings on
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we didn't feel it was prudent to
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
move these forward without having those
 
00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
move these forward without having those
questions

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
and and concerns answered so uh
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
i will not be supporting this bill to
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
move forward for
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
for that main reason that we've now not
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to have our
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
studied or answered and i feel it would
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
be just as viable to just
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
return this bill and bring it back next
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
year in its original form and
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
i think the committee would at that
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
point in time it'll be a new seated
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
committee and they would
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
take a uh you know we could look at the
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill and uh
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
make a decision at that point if they
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to work on it or
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
or how they wanted to proceed madam
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%

has not been an issue with neon mix
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%

rivero

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
rivero
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
might uh there's been studies that have
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
been done by
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
unh dr wallin fit also even uh stated
 
00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
unh dr wallin fit also even uh stated
that

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
uh we also had presentations by
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
director russo and uh the gentleman i
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
can't think of his name off the top of
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
my head
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
that does the bee analysis uh
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
that indicated that the first failure of
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
the beehives in new hampshire is the
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
might followed by
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
new beekeepers that are inexperienced
 
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
new beekeepers that are inexperienced
whereas

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
all the ones are doing well in addition
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
to that their survey of last year
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
showed that they have found eight to ten
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
brand new bee
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh species within the state of uh new
 
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.230 align:start position:0%
uh species within the state of uh new
hampshire

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
so um with that i believe that our uh
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
ibm the integrated management program
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
does an outstanding job in here uh and
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
as representative pearl said
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh we're supposed to receive
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
documentation on the e
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
epa uh results that were coming out
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh plus uh we had a nice handout by doc
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
by uh director russo
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
on what the state was doing to mitigate
 
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.509 align:start position:0%
on what the state was doing to mitigate
that

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
and especially the issue with giving uh
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
full powers to the commission of what
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
can be accepted by pesticides and not
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
accepted so with that i will not be uh
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you thank you roger
 
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.790 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you thank you roger
o'connor

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
o'connor
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
um representative bixby you have your
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
hand up would you like to add
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'd like to um
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit of clarification in terms
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
of the form that this should be going
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
forward in i believe that um
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it was entirely clear
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
from uh what representative
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
akita said but um the it would
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to have this put forward
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
as a study committee
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the uh first term first year of next
 
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.590 align:start position:0%
in the uh first term first year of next
term

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
because um it needs more study than we
 
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.909 align:start position:0%
because um it needs more study than we
can

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
before drafting the actual legislation
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
then we can
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
um then we can manage given the
 
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
um then we can manage given the
constraints

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
of coven 19 those constraints are also
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
what prevented us from
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with it appropriately over the
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
summer uh
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
so uh i think that uh
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
there are there is a real problem with
 
00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
there are there is a real problem with
uh

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
the with a number of pesticides in terms
 
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
the with a number of pesticides in terms
of

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
weakening the bee population and
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
the current thinking among entomologists
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
it is not a single factor that is uh
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
weakening bee populations but as a
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
combination of factors
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
one of the factors is that um
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are a range of pesticides that
 
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.470 align:start position:0%
there are a range of pesticides that
reduce

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
the ability of bees to have their
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
natural resistance
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
to a range of diseases and pests and b
 
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
to a range of diseases and pests and b
pests

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
pests
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
such as the mites and such as nosema
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
and american foul brood there's a whole
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
range of
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
um of b diseases and
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
when the bee population is uh is
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
weakened by pesticides
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
they are they they have less of their
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
natural resistance to those
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
other um damaging factors
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that we really do need to go
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
forward with legislation
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
and i think that we need to have a
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
thorough study to figure out exactly how
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
that should be set up for new hampshire
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much jordan bixby
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so here a hand just came flying up so
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
here's the order that we're going to go
 
00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:11.029 align:start position:0%
here's the order that we're going to go
in

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative ellis because you're
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually holding your hand up so you're
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to go next
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then representative erin and
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
representative bolden you'll go next and
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
then within
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
our attendees we do have a hand raise
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's representative horrigan
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
because we're in an executive session
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to call on you so you can
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
put your hand down um so with that said
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
the three of you if you're ready to go
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
um as i understand that you can't rely
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
on unh
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
because the people that were experts at
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
it have
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
moved on to different jobs i guess
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm in favor of moving this
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislation on
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
and not in a study committee
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
because uh it's just slowing it down
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to act a lot faster than we
 
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:03.530 align:start position:0%
are right now
 
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.789 align:start position:0%
are right now
[Music]

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
and the constituents of kaabi are really
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
concerned about having it moved on
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative ellis thank you
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
i represent aaron yes thank you very
 
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.750 align:start position:0%
i represent aaron yes thank you very
much

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair i just wanted to echo
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
what uh representative pearl and
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative o'connor had said but
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm concerned about moving this
 
00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.789 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm concerned about moving this
particular

00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill along rather than
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
creating some new legislation because
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to do work on this bill was
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
because we were waiting for some
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
updated statistics and new information
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
apparently through some of the testimony
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
some data that was being gathered and
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
we were also looking to see what had
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
we were also looking to see what had
happened

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh in places like the european union
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
that had banned certain pesticides and
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
what the effects that that would have
 
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
what the effects that that would have
been

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i i don't see um i don't see the
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
see that we should be moving this
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
particular bill along
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and instead be looking at uh perhaps
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the future coming up with a better
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
crafted bill
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
um representing the bulls and then we'll
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um i understand
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
what we've previously discussed about
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
the best
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
strategy for filing bills next term but
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
as a committee i think it would be
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to kind of get into the
 
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.710 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to kind of get into the
weeds

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
by discussing what specific type of bill
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
should be filed next year
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
especially since i don't think we should
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
prejudice a future legislature or a
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
future iteration of this committee
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
for or against any specific bill
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
language so i think we should just
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
express our desire to see more on the
 
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
express our desire to see more on the
subject

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
and why we feel it's important and let
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
the future legislators decide the best
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
way to craft legislation to satisfy that
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
end and that's why i'm gonna vote to
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
support the
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh motion to recommend for future
 
00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
uh motion to recommend for future
legislation

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you president bowman um uh
 
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
great thank you president bowman um uh
christian

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
christian
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair um i'm also going to vote in
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
support of recommending future
 
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
support of recommending future
legislation

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
um i believe representative erin had a
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
great point that
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
um the delay has given us some time to
 
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:40.789 align:start position:0%
um the delay has given us some time to
see

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
new research coming out of the european
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
union and elsewhere
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
um in fact there was a great study um
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
earlier this year about in
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
the journal of see i have it
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
my here i clicked away uh
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
where are you oh yes the journal of
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
agriculture ecosystems and the
 
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
agriculture ecosystems and the
environment

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh showing reduced species richness of
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
native bees
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
in fields that have been treated with
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids elsewhere in
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
north america i also want to
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
highlight the point that this bill is
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
not intended to
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
protect only honeybee species commercial
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
honeybee species
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
but also our native bees which are more
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
susceptible to
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
accumulation in soils and and i think
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know and of course where we just
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot less uh
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
research known but what it is there is
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
certainly in support of
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of bees being very susceptible to these
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
sorts of pesticides
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
i also want to note that the original
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
bill that was brought for this was much
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive in terms of
 
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive in terms of
addressing

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
all the multiple factors that we know
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
affects bees habitat loss
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things and and we're
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
told to
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
make it more narrow which we've done so
 
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:05.830 align:start position:0%
make it more narrow which we've done so
um

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
i feel that that's been addressed
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately and uh
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes i will be voting to support this
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
building stuff
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you um okay so
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative bean
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you want to say anything
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have to if you don't want to
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
but because
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i can't see a hand raise i just want to
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that you don't want to add to
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
with that said is there any additional
 
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
with that said is there any additional
conversation

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
concerns comments before we go into the
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
all right so with that representative if
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
you are ready
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
we can do our roll call or vote
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion on the table is to
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
wrote uh
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay and with that um just to recap
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
normally when we're in our hearing room
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
we would have a minority
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
and a majority report in this instance
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
the committee is putting together one
 
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
the committee is putting together one
report

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.010 align:start position:0%
so um i don't need um
 
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
so um i don't need um
[Music]

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
we already know who's going to write
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
that report so it's going to be
 
00:27:03.679 --> 00:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
that report so it's going to be
representative

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
bolden so um so we're good there
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
so check all right moving on then
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
can i just clarify just a little bit
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's not that uh it's not a factor of us
 
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:18.789 align:start position:0%
it's not that uh it's not a factor of us
being

00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh in our on zoom versus being in the
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee room it's a matter of this is
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
the way it works with
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
a retained bill true thank you very much
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is bixby i appreciate the
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
clarification that is true
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
at this point in the process yes
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
um okay so moving on
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
if clerk or wherever they're coming
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
would you be ready if we moved on to the
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.830 align:start position:0%
would you be ready if we moved on to the
next

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm ready perfect all right
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
i can't just look right over at you and
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
see what what forms are in front of you
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
um moving on then we have house bill
 
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
um moving on then we have house bill
1418

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
1418
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
which is authorizing funds of the
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture to be used for
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
increasing farm energy efficiency
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion yes
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
i move that we recommend for future
 
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
i move that we recommend for future
legislation

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
and do i have a second i'll second that
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
all right um and with that
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
to your motion
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes the um that we referred this to
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
interim study because
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh although we thought it was a good
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
idea to
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
improve energy efficiency and
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
enter small-scale energy production
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
on farms we thought that uh well it was
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
clear that the
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism using the department
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
of agriculture
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
um uh water treatment funds was
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect and uh we felt that
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture was the
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
wrong place to
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
um administrate this but uh in terms of
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh improving energy efficiency on farms
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
and clearly there are a number of energy
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
intensive things on farms like if you're
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
doing maple syrup
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sure uh then
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of energy in terms of
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
either using
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
boiling or some combination of boiling
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and reverse osmosis
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
and any operation that requires
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
refrigeration obviously uses a lot of
 
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.549 align:start position:0%
refrigeration obviously uses a lot of
energy

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
by um improving the efficiency of those
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
processes and by generating electricity
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
on site
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
farms could get a great advantage it
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
could have a great advantage
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of their costs so and
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
one of the barriers is that the
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
long-term savings is substantial but
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
getting over that initial um problem of
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
having the capital to
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
get the equipment in place is a real
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
challenge uh
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
so being able to uh have the
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
the state help out farms with uh funding
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
is a really great idea um
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that the future legislation
 
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.909 align:start position:0%
and i think that the future legislation
should

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh should uh figure out
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
the best way to fund it and which um
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
um administrative department should be
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
overseeing it but i think there's a it's
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
a great idea and it should go forward
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you revlon bixby um leave
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
two hands that will go in order
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
so representative pearl and then
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative o'connor
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm faster than he is
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're younger oh
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's true uh thank you madam chair so
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i would say you know for many of
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
the reasons that i stated
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
in the last bill that we had a lot of
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions and
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
for some of the reasons that uh
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby just raised about
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
you know the concern about having it
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
funded within the
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture and especially
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
in the manner that it was
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me like it would be a
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
lot cleaner to
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
not recommend this bill because there's
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
so many different areas that don't work
 
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:20.070 align:start position:0%
so many different areas that don't work
well

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
and to just come back with a clean new
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill next year and present it
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it just seems to me like it would be
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot it would be it would
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
be a lot cleaner to do that and come in
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
with a with a bill that isn't going to
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
reference a bill that we know it has
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
some problems in it already and
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it sets it back any to
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
not move this bill forward and come in
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
with one next year that hits the areas
 
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
with one next year that hits the areas
that

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know that some of the concerns that
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
we had and and i think it would be
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
better off for the committee next term
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
which hopefully many of us will be back
 
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.389 align:start position:0%
which hopefully many of us will be back
but

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
for those who are they they know this
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill existed and they understand that
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
and those who weren't will have the
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
ability you know in the
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
to look at a nice new clean bill that's
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'connor thank
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh first with some of representative
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
bixby said
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
is correct but uh i still can't support
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh basically a lot of what the
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative pearl had mentioned
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
but i want to echo the sentiments of the
 
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
but i want to echo the sentiments of the
commissioner

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh this bill has two components to it
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if we could
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
it should be split on the commissioner
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i quote
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
says the department has no expertise in
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
the energy management
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
of some of the areas and this bill
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
should direct it
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
over to the department of uh initiatives
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh basically it's nutrition a new
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
nutrient type
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill which they special uh specialized
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the areas of manure pits etc
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
so with that i would recommend that any
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislators coming back for next years
 
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
legislators coming back for next years
to

00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
either offer two bills to the forward
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i can't support the bill as written
 
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
but i can't support the bill as written
uh

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
as per the request to the commissioner
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you or general connor is there any
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
no all right well with that rather than
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
comfort would you like to
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
please call the vote sure thank you
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
um so we're taking a vote on uh
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
recommending for future legislation

of concern and the

response and the report coming out of
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%

uh going forward and correct me if i'm
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
wrong representative marriage since you

were taking all the notes down there
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
that um this would only just confuse the
 
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
that um this would only just confuse the
issue

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we should stay with one major uh
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill that's already out there
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's being established and i also let
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative evil know that i would
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
not be able to
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
join her on future legislation but i'd
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
be there for testimony
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mount thank you
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
is there any additional conversation
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
comments questions concerns there we go
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
there we go try it again i waited this
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
time so that representative o'connor
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
could be first
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh again i want to
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
echo the same sentiment that we had a
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
lot of unanswered questions on this bill
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have the benefit
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
of of having the study committee that
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
was supposed to occur so
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
for that reason i i feel it would be
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
best to not move
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation forward and allow a
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
bill to come in next year from a new
 
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.230 align:start position:0%
bill to come in next year from a new
sponsor

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%

to your motion
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh this is a fairly simple
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislation i think we decided on
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
interim study because there was some
 
00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
interim study because there was some
concerns

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
about how it would be initially the fund
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
would be initially funded and then
 
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
would be initially funded and then
ongoing

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
funding but it was noted by the farm
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
bureau which
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
supports this legislation that new
 
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
supports this legislation that new
hampshire

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
is currently at a disadvantage because
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
we do not have this fund
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
we cannot apply for matching grants
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
so by creating this fund if we can
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
figure out the appropriate mechanisms
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
we would put new hampshire on a level
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
playing field with other states
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:40.230 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
discussion

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative pearl just trying to
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
give representative
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
o'connor the opportunity to jump in
 
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:47.349 align:start position:0%
o'connor the opportunity to jump in
again

00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh ontario thank you again the i
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
i have concerns that there were
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions raised on this bill
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
in committee especially funding
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions and going into the
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
tight budgeting year that we're going to
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
be going into next year i just think it
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
would prudent
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
not to recommend this to move forward
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
and to allow for a bill to be

uh
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner deems that this
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
could be an important area
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
then let him add it into the uh budget
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
and uh go through the budget process
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
that would be the easiest way to do it
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make a a comment i
 
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.589 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make a a comment i
think

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
we could establish this um uh fund
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
with few dollars i don't think it needs
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
to be ten thousand twenty thousand
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure but i think if we
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
have something set aside
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be a thousand or you know
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
500 i think that would establish the
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
fund and then we could
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know uh go uh seeking uh
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%

did a very fine job we are you know
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%

o'connor uh representative bixby has his
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
i think that we did a really good job of
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
amending a lot of legislation that came
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
and making it putting into much better
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
shape and
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
i am very disappointed that
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has put a lot of that
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislation on hold
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to bringing it back
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
next term
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i think i hope we can move it
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
through very swiftly since we've done a
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
through an omnibus bill that was the
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
cost of care that got capped at two
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh we still have a commission on that
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
that i'll be running cheer
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully around the first of october
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
we set that up with
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
joel but there were many bills that we
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
all agreed upon that
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
went into an army bus bill and i think
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
that representative bixby just brought
 
00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
that representative bixby just brought
up

00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
those need to be picked up by whoever
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
wins and
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
bring them back next year because
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're ready to go
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they were good bills so there's a
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
lot that's you know
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
that can come out of this committee that
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
can't be forgotten so again i thank you
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
all and
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully i'll be up to every once in a
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
while to testify if needed
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mom um that'd be fun
 
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mom um that'd be fun
representation

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank uh representative
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
um leader
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
um o'connor for everything that he's
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
done since i've been elected he
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
um he was a great chairman and he made
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
us all feel welcome
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
and he his knowledge base is
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
just incredible and um
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
i will miss that the most because he
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
at the city level and at the municipal
 
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.549 align:start position:0%
at the city level and at the municipal
level

00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
he knows everything and we're gonna miss
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
that sorely
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
but he his decorum and grace i think are
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
the things that i'll miss the most and i
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%

i especially appreciate
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
the sensible discussions that we've had
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
the sharing of ideas the
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that we worked hard and
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
diligently on many of these pieces of
 
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.309 align:start position:0%
diligently on many of these pieces of
legislation

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
and we came out with some really good
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
bills which
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
was a shame that um some of them didn't
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
make it through
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll be able to deal with
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
them next time
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
with for whoever is here next year
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
this is really a great group of people i
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
enjoyed working with
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
all of you and um i think
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
we should really really be proud of the
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
work that we've done together
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
and talks about each other
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
