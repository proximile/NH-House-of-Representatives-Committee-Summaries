the New Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
just to give you some background the New
 
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission has its own
 
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.220 align:start position:0%
Police Department that is a regulatory
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
Police Department unlike traditional
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
we regulate alcohol and we regulate
 
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.430 align:start position:0%
we regulate alcohol and we regulate
tobacco

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
with that in mind given the uh the
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
reasoning for this played as as how we
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
call it a cleanup
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
my background I came from State Police
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
28 years with the state police I ran the
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Investigative Services prior
 
00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:31.459 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Cruisers that I had under my command
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
had two license plates they had one to
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
do surveillance and they had another one
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
to be high profile and transparent The
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission doesn't have that
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and set up
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
as I was bringing this up over the last
 
00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:53.779 align:start position:0%
six years that I've been in place
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
everybody has asked why isn't this
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a reason for it uh but
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
under our new Administration we were
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
brought in to clean up and change a lot
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
of stuff that uh we felt could be done
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
better uh and this was one of the many
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
items that we have changed or are asking
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
to be changed uh with that in mind our
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
investigators on a nightly basis are out
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
at our 6400 licensed establishments
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
um at times they are running
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
surveillance so they do need an
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
undescript license plate or a license
 
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.500 align:start position:0%
plate that is a regular one
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
to do some of their daily operations at
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
the same time we run
 
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:39.949 align:start position:0%
the same time we run
um

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh operations or security details at
 
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
either open venue
 
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.090 align:start position:0%
either open venue

um Bike Week
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
down at the beach where we have uh
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
detailing that's magnetic for the cars
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
we just don't have license plates to be
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
high profile that license plate I do
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
have a rendition uh the proposed
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
rendition or the proposed license plate
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
will look very similar uh to one when I
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
rebranded Marine Patrol when they when
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
they merged into the state police it's
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
the same blue uh with the white
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
background we felt it was a good
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
identifier very easily identified by the
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
public and by our licensees
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and I've heard no uh negative
 
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.420 align:start position:0%
pushback on this proposed uh initiative
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%

representative C
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
about how many uh uh license plates
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
would be issued under this
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh right now 30 investigators
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh three vehicles that are
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
um multi-use vehicles that would be
 
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
plated under under this initiative
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%

also
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
um it was uh proposed that we would
 
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
probably purchase a dual set just in
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
case something happened to that first
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
one uh but we're talking in the area of
 
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:32.389 align:start position:0%
one uh but we're talking in the area of
maybe

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%

representing the Department of Motor
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
Vehicles director marasco and Jeff

hobedank and both in support of the bill
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
looking for two minutes
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
so much and members of the committee
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me and Jeff here
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
um as uh director armagedian stated uh
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
we we do support the bill there's no
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to the DMV
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
um director armagedian originally
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
reached out to see if that was something
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
the DMV could do and we realized that
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
there had to be a change to the statute
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
it makes sense from a law enforcement
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint visibility transparency
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and uh again because there's no no
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
real impact to our operation we're happy
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
to do it so we support it registration
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
supervisor Jeff oberdank can take any
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
additional questions you may have
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
me as well
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.129 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
committee

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
I have to have a question for you guys
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
to justify my being here I just my
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
question is why do things like this take
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
I guess I could start with that I think
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
this particular statute I give director
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
armagedy a ton of credit because he
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to do the right thing for his
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
officers and when you look at it and you
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
realize other agencies are authorized to
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
have a plate like that but liquor
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement wasn't we just wanted to
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
make that right so this was the Forum to
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
do it and we're just thankful you're
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative sakes
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman director uh
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps this is for
 
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:27.829 align:start position:0%
perhaps this is for
um

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
your cohort
 
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
your cohort
um

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
we've heard in the past about license
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
plate bills that have come before us
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
that there's a significant software cost
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
involved and I I assume that the as you
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
just testified your numbers are correct
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
but can you
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
sort of explain to me why we don't have
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
that software issue
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh and creating these plates
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I maybe I can just start with that as
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
far as uh the the plates will be paid
 
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
for by liquor enforcement so from that
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
standpoint there's no fiscal impact to
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
the DMV
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
um aluminum obviously is uh you know
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
always at a premium but uh but the
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
number of places we're talking about
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
here a small number but anything you
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
have I would also add from a system
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
standpoint representative that uh we
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
already have a transaction built for
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
Municipal Police plates
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
this would just be using that same
 
00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.650 align:start position:0%
this would just be using that same
transaction

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we have full audit capabilities to
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're issuing plates onto
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
the right transaction type and they're
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
being charged the right fees thank you
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
Mr oberdank I appreciate it you're
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
welcome very good question
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes thank you for that
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative sellers
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
so when the statute doesn't talk about
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
design at all except for the motto Live
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
Free or Die on the plate and I know the
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
other person that was just up and talked
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
it had somewhat of a design of the plate
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any problems with that at
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
all or is that more
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
design come to the DMVs purview as far
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
as how it's going to be
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think I can start I think the uh the
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
design of the plate actually models
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
um other plates that already exist to
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
include a state police plate uh Marine
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
Patrol plate and actually I believe uh
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
the director that's what he
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
um this plate was actually modeled after
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
a Marine Patrol plate so they're very
 
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.850 align:start position:0%
a Marine Patrol plate so they're very
similar

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
so it will still have the Live Free or
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
Die on there as well right we can
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
certainly pass this around if you'd like
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it representative no
 
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'm all set I just it does say have
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
lymph Frieda at the top
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
um it is very recognizable as state
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency as a liquor state
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement and New Hampshire
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so in the event that a
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
citizen wants to know
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
um who the vehicle belongs to
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
um it's clearly identifiable and Live
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none well with these plates now
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
you'll be subject to the next bill we
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
see to remove the private plates so
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that goes in the future
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
wish nobody else signed up to speak on
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 268 have been I'm going to
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is on Bill
 
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.070 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is on Bill

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the public hearing
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 163 FN relative to
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
authorized license plate decals uh chair
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and
 
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:42.860 align:start position:0%
representatives thank you for this time
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
my name is representative sellers I
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
um at this time this bill here was uh
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
presented to me uh so I would actually
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
be a sponsor of it and as a veteran
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
myself of a little over six years I
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
looked at this and I said well to me it
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
just looked like a little bit of
 
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.649 align:start position:0%
just looked like a little bit of
housekeeping

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and to point out a few items here
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
because there are a couple other
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
speakers today that will actually
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
dive into the more details of this as
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
well but I mean housekeeping you can see
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
on line 10 you know we've added space
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh which has been new in the last I
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
think three years or so
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
and then also on line 16 the Coast Guard
 
00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:31.070 align:start position:0%
and then also on line 16 the Coast Guard
cross

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
cross
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
and then you go through a 21 through I
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't know 30 31 I guess
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
and these are all uh distinguished
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
metals and also Metals for heroism
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
and then on the second page one through
 
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.810 align:start position:0%
and then on the second page one through
four

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:49.820 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
the speakers behind me um we got the
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
agent General here today and he's gonna
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
basically talk to the sections uh 21 to
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
30 or 21 to 29
 
00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:01.669 align:start position:0%
30 or 21 to 29
um

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
these seem to be metals that are very
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
very very seldom given but having them
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the law could mean that even if one
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
person laundered them and it could be in
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years it would be uh
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
what what I understand might be quite a
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
bit I mean these these these uh Metals
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
here are basically for kernels and
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
Generals and so forth on up so they're
 
00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:26.839 align:start position:0%
not giving out quite that often so
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh other than that there's really not
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
much more I can say to this you did get
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
a handout on 163
 
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.329 align:start position:0%
a handout on 163
um

00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
where the veterans plate decals what
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
they these are the actual decals and
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
again we have another speaker that will
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
actually speak to these decals and stuff
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
so I'll be glad to take any questions at
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Jones
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
one of the people that are speaking to
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
this so are they going to be able to
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by authentication well
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
I assume you go to DMV and you have to
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
show proof that you are
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
that you meet some of these standards
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing in the background yes
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
they will okay thank you
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:14.569 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
committee

00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you very much
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair we're recognized is
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry uh in support of the bill
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry I'm the deputy Edge and
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire's Department
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and Veterans
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
Services we support the bill but we are
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
going to recommend an amendment to
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
delete lines 21 through 29 that covers
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
the distinguished service medals and
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
I'll talk a little bit about that as we
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
as we go through uh
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
for your information the department of
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and Veterans Services
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
specifically the division of veteran
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
services is responsible for the issue
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the authentication of eligibility
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
for these uh for these decals that go on
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the plates
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
we believe that the metals in that are
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
listed in lines 21 through 29 the
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
distinguished service medals and then
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
the distinguished service medals for
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
each of the separate branches including
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
the defense Superior service medal and
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Legion of Merit are not really
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
metals that would warrant being put on
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
decals I mean these are service Metals
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're generally presented to people
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
who have worked at the highest levels of
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the Pentagon or in combatant commands
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
generally reserved for three and four
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
star generals or Admirals and very very
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
rarely uh presented so we just don't
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
think that they should be on the on the
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
decal plates right we prefer the metals
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that are awarded for Valor or heroism
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
so we're making the recommendation that
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
they that they be uh
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
be deleted from the this particular bill
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
just for your information we've issued
 
00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.250 align:start position:0%
just for your information we've issued
about

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
we've you know the issue of the metals
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
we currently uh issue we've issued only
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
three sets of Silver Star
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
only 17 sets of the Bronze Star for
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
Valor because it requires the valorous
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
citation and 17 cents for 17 sets of
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
medals for gold star families and in
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
each of these cases some veterans who
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
earned these medals are awarded these
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
medals bought multiple sets because they
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
have multiple cars so it's very rare
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
that we issue Metals metal sets anyway
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the service decals and
 
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
adding space force so far we've issued
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
225 sets of army 122 sets of Navy 152
 
00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:04.099 align:start position:0%
sets of Air Force
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
281 sets of Marine Corps Semper Fi
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
although I was in the Army uh they're
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
leading the way and 61 sets of the Coast
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
Guard uh we love we love them all
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
so from from that perspective we just
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
think that there won't be any demand for
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
these particular distinguished service
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
medals based on the the level you have
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
to obtain and rank and service to be
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
able to get them you know I think I know
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
of one retired three-star General that
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire his name is Pete
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
van gel I think he's from Boston some of
 
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:37.460 align:start position:0%
you may know him uh used to be my boss
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
and then uh so we just don't think that
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
these message you know it's just not
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
necessary for two reasons one there will
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
be no demand and two the service medals
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily presented for Heroic
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
acts so that's really my statement I'll
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh before I end my statement I'll say
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
that other the other metals that are
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
added in this legislation the medals for
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
heroism that begin on page third line 30
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
of page two and go through uh line four
 
00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
of page two and go through uh line four
of

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh page three those uh those soldiers
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
metal airmen's metal Navy Marine Corps
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
metal Coast Guard metal those are metals
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
that are presented in peacetime for
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
members of the Department of Defense who
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
say who risk their lives to save a life
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
and very very rarely presented right now
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I you know in 28 years of my service
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
I've only known two people that received
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
the soldiers medal one of them is one of
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
our state troopers sethgar who was
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
pulling people out of The Towers in New
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
York City on 9 11. so it's a you know
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
those they deserve to have the sticker
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
if they want one there's no doubt about
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
that so we we absolutely support the
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
other the bill and the other changes we
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
just recommend that these Metals be
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
deleted so subject to your questions and
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
veteran service organizations which
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
should be familiar to your youth things
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
like the American Legion the veterans of
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
foreign war Disabled American Veterans I
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
personally represent the the air and
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
space forces Association used to be the
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
Air Force Association now we've added
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the space force because they're a
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
separate service that just celebrated
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
their third year anniversary in December
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
um we are chartered actually by state
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
RSA 115 colon a-8 if you want to look up
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
what who it is we are and what we do to
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
sort of speak for the the veterans in
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
our state one of the things that I do
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
when we get the language on bills is I
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
pick out the ones that have better
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
impact and then I come and I Tell You
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
Folks what it is that we think about
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
those bills the reason I haven't taken a
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
position on this one is pretty much what
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry just talked to you about
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
is that that one section about about the
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the awards that are primarily
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
awards for higher uh uh folks in the in
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
the military and also are used for
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
retirements or or permanent change of
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
station Awards things I will give you an
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
example when we discuss this at our
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
meeting and we did have the language we
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
voted to follow this rather than take a
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
position on it because there are parts
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
we support but then there are other
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
parts that we think I don't think
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of demand for
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
this so the Legion of Meredith typically
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
award an award you'll see that on line
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
number 29 on the first page there that's
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
an award that's given to Colonels when
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
they retire so we went around the room
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
we said who in here has a Legion of
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
Merit and about a half a dozen hands
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
went up you know who in here wants it on
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
their license plate all the hands went
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
down so we think that the we think that
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
the actual demand for these
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
awards that are are are are primarily
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
for doing your job but not for heroism
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
and other things like that we think that
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
demand is going to be very very low and
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
so that's why we would we would prefer
 
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:51.980 align:start position:0%
to see them come out uh of of this bill
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh so again I was told to just kind of
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
follow this but it seemed like a good
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity because this is the first
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
time I've testified for your committee
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
this year to tell you kind of who it is
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
what we and what we do at the state
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee you're more
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
than welcome to join us at any one of
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
our meetings we typically meet the
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
second two or the first Tuesday of every
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
month at the uh the cross training
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
center in Pembroke at five o'clock and
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to do is just
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
kind of throw out there if you're going
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor a bill or sponsor a bill
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
that has veteran involvement please let
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
us know we'd be more than happy to help
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
you word Smith language or tell you
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
about whether this thing that you're
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
pres you're proposing has been tried in
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the past and if it didn't work before
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
why it didn't work before we'd be we're
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
a resource that you folks can use and so
 
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're subject to my any questions that
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
you have that's all I wanted to tell you
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much always good to see
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
somebody from Hooksett yes sir
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
I just have one thank you it's safe to
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
say if lines 21 through 29 were amended
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
out of the bill you possibly would have
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
a position though if you amend those
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
lines out the state veterans advisory
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee will support this Bill yes
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir yes sir
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen no other questions thank you
 
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.730 align:start position:0%
I've seen no other questions thank you
again

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes I'm going to
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
say Eric painter uh representing himself
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
supporting of the bill uh looking for
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
did I say it right Eric painter
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
Piner sorry
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me testify in
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
front of the transportation committee
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Eric power I'm
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
a resident of Brookline in the southern
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
part of the state and I support this
 
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.390 align:start position:0%
part of the state and I support this
bill

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
um you have a handout in front of you
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
that talks about HB 163 a pictorial
 
00:44:59.530 --> 00:44:59.540 align:start position:0%
it shows
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
the top 21 metals that we have in the
 
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:05.060 align:start position:0%
United States military
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
from the Medal of Honor through the
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
Purple Heart and everything in between
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
on the left side you'll see stars that
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
indicate the current RSA 21c4 that shows
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
the available decals today
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
and then you see in green the bill
 
00:45:25.569 --> 00:45:25.579 align:start position:0%
which is proposing to add a number of
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
decals so that every
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
every decal or every award in the top 21
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
is available for fairness to members of
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
the military that have earned these
 
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.690 align:start position:0%
the military that have earned these
Awards

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
on the second page I wanted to mention
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
there was some research done on what is
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
happening in the other 50 states and of
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
these of this list here how many are
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
done by each state and you can see
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lit there's quite a
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
variance here there's some as low as
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
just two
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
um all the way up to 20. and so there's
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is basically in the middle
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
we're about average
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
um there's 25 states that offer them
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
less than us and we're kind of in the
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
middle as if there's the the balance or
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
more and there's some tied with New
 
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
more and there's some tied with New
Hampshire

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill whatever form it
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
goes forward in should add to the number
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we offer more than six and i would
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
support that
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
um down below you'll see the service
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
seals of our six current military
 
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.410 align:start position:0%
seals of our six current military
services

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:35.420 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
the space force was founded in December
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
of 2019 and it was um
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh hasn't been added to this bill I know
 
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:47.420 align:start position:0%
there was another bill I think it was
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
hb206 that is recognizing the space
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
force and some other legislation but not
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
in this so I think it's it's wise not to
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
leave our what they call Guardians in
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
so the other piece I want to mention is
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm also a veteran myself I served
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
for 30 years in the Air Force both in
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
the Air National Guard in the Air Force
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
Reserve and
 
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
Reserve and
um

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I have a background in what the
 
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:20.660 align:start position:0%
metals mean and um I myself am a
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
recipient of two Legions of Merit just
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
to let you know about that so when I saw
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
this that that was let F lift out as
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
well as all the distinguished service
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
medals I would um
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
I was wondering why that happened
 
00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:36.530 align:start position:0%
I was wondering why that happened
because

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
there are metals below that that are
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
offered but not ones above it so it
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
seems a matter of fairness that if you
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
happen to
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
earn one of these medals
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
distinguished medals these are not
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
easily earned for folks that serve in
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
the military they're reserved as they
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
said for for Colonels Navy captains and
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard captains and
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and some one two three four-star
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
generals for some of the higher ones
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
the the Legion of Merit is sometimes
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
awarded to very senior senior enlisted
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
in e-9 maybe serving as a command
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
sergeant major or a command chief Master
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
Sergeant or equivalent Master Chief in
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
the Navy
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
and um so those those Awards those folks
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
have sacrificed Decades of service so I
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
think it makes Fair it's fair for them
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a single heroic act a
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
single Valor maybe they'd never had the
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity but they did dedicate
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
Decades of service to their country so
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that those are
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
included they're also higher ranking in
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
the Precedence than some of the others
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
that are on the list so I think it makes
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
sense to consider those to pass the bill
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
as recommended
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wants to be
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
take care of our veterans recognize our
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
veterans allow them to have that that
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
decal because it can spark a
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
conversation and say wow what what is
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
this distinguished service medal that
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
you have what is this
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
airman's medal that you have what is
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
this soldier's medal that you have
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
um some people don't want to have that
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
some people do some people are very
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
private some people are very proud of it
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
so leaving that option open for all of
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
the metals that are listed here in this
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
bill I think is a wise move and would
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
honor veterans give them the choice
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
whether they want the decal or not
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
they're not that many that would be
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
awarded so I don't think it's a major
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
expense for the for the uh for the state
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I would recommend that you pass this
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
to pass Auto committee thank you I'll
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.109 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
committee

00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you again thank you
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh that's the last speaker I have signed
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
up on House Bill 163 FN I'm going to
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing

uh next up we've got House Bill 646 FN
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
assistant

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
all right Welcome Back Being 10 33 I'm
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
going to open up the public hearing on
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes representative Tom
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
mannon to introduce the bill good
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
morning sir good morning
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom mannion I
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District One Pelham
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 646
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating the vehicle inspection
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
mandate for non-commercial vehicles
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
I'll start with a small story a few
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
years back I was driving up 495 with my
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
when my alternator gave out I coasted
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
across multiple Lanes of traffic and
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
managed to pull over safely as I awaited
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
AAA I looked over at my car inspection
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
sticker not even a month old these
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
stickers do not give a force field of
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
safety they do not guarantee a car will
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
make it a year without problems what
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
they do however is create headaches for
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
the rest of us and burden low-income
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
families disproportionately
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
these families stretch car lifetimes
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
because they have to
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
when presented with a list of nitpicky
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
problems that must be addressed to get
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
state-sponsored gold star they'll just
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
continue to operate with a rejection
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
sticker and eat whatever potential fines
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper than repairs or
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
buying a new vehicle only 14 states
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
require annual safety inspections 14.
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
safety's inspections is also a misnomer
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
the governor the government
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
accountability office published a study
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
that showed no correlation between
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes and inspection mandates
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
in fact 94 percent of vehicle crashes
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
are caused by driver error with
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
mechanical failure being two percent and
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
like my Dodge Avenger on 495 those
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
failures can still occur with an
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
so we're introducing a burden onto
 
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
drivers with no provable benefit direct
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
dollar Compares components aside there's
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
a Time cost as well these stations are
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
open during average working hours
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
requiring taking time off to get our
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
permission slips so hourly workers are
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
not only paying the cost of the
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
inspection and potential repairs but
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
losing out on wages for the time
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
required to get it done
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
the other argument I've been hearing is
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
about the inspections from an emissions
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint nature.com released a study
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
outlining that in 2020 when most of the
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
industrialized countries locked down
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
production vast quantities of
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
individuals were no longer commuting the
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
global CO2 emission levels were only
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
slowed by at most 7.5 percent
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
think about how we're still reeling from
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
supply chain shortages the evisceration
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
of small businesses rampant inflation
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
and teasing of a global recession and we
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
barely moved the needle for CO2
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
and the EPA thinks emissions testing
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
Granite State or sedans is Justified
 
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
they have their scary extortion threats
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
that they'll just keep our tax money and
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
not pay for the highways so we're
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
operating a program out of fear of
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
federal retribution causing Granite
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
Staters money to comply with yet another
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
overreaching mandate from D.C and
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's enough evidence from 2020 to
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
conclude that it doesn't even serve the
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
intended purpose over half the states
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't require emissions testing I guess
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
Florida doesn't have highways or dense
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
urban areas that the EPA claims requires
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
annual testing
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
back to the supply chain shortages for a
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
moment for a moment uh during the last
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
few years getting parts required to
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
repair Vehicles has experienced waves of
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
difficulty how are you supposed to bring
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
your vehicle up to compliance when Parts
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
aren't available
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
do the police take this into account and
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
just look the other way
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
all the fear-mongering about cars
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
exploding into Rusty shrapnel or
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
whatever the argument is on the highways
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
is on hold
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
or are we not supposed to drive to work
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
until the supply chain is corrected what
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
if I'm part of the supply chain I can't
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
legally drive my vehicle to deliver the
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
car parts to fix my car
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to join the 36 other
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
states that do not require annual safety
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
inspections I urge you to vote OTP on
 
01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
hb646 I'll take your questions
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
I just have one what did you say failed
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh my alternator an alternator yep thank
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you chair
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned this inspection
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
stickers and I and I tend to agree with
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
you it's for One Moment In Time
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
so when they inspect it it's perfect
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
everything's great you drive out the
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
door and something could happen that's
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes Rebecca oler
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as opposed to the
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill looking for three minutes
 
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.769 align:start position:0%
bill looking for three minutes
welcome

01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
yep click on the microphone

Rebecca uller Department of
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and and yes the department is opposed
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
light duty vehicles and medium duty
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles are the number one source of
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
air pollution in the state of New
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the primary pollutants that
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
are of concern are both particulate
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
matter as well as the nitrogen oxide and
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
and volatile organic compounds that are
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
emitted they react in the presence of
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
sunlight and form ground level ozone
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
which is a very strong respiratory
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
irritant and can be in summertime get
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
high enough so that we put out air
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
quality action days that recommend that
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
that children and people with uh with
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
respiratory issues and elderly not go
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
outside we still do have days like that
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in the summer we have
 
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:22.460 align:start position:0%
far fewer now than we did in the past
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the one of the key reasons for that is
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
because we've implemented an onboard
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
diagnostics inspection program and
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
annually of all light duty and medium
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
duty Vehicles need to pass that
 
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.950 align:start position:0%
duty Vehicles need to pass that
inspection

01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that inspection ensures that the
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle's emission control system is
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
working as designed by the manufacturer
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't get to the safety portion
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the inspection and I'm sure others
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
will will speak to that
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
um the the Department's position on this
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
is just related to the emissions that
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
come out we've seen a significant
 
01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
reduction in emissions from the
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
Transportation sector over the years as
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
a result we are in compliance with
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
Federal standards now however under the
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act the measures that a state
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
takes to get into compliance with the
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
federal standard must remain in place to
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that we stay in compliance with
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
that standard
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
um as you see in our testimony letter
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
um and Jessica will you hand that I'm
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
sorry Joe we've had a testimony letter
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
coming out
 
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.649 align:start position:0%
coming out
um

01:10:26.649 --> 01:10:26.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
if our our
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection program was submitted
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
as a as a Federal attainment Tool
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
and uh was approved by the Environmental
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency even if New Hampshire
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
were to stop implementing uh our vehicle
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
inspection OBD program technically the
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
the EPA could come in and and enforce
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
its uh continued operation in the state
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that they would do that
 
01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:56.900 align:start position:0%
but it would cause a big
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
it would cause a big headache for the
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
state I'll stop at that and if anybody
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
has any questions I'd be happy to answer
 
01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.910 align:start position:0%
has any questions I'd be happy to answer
them

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.669 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
seeing that representative Abu sorry
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Miss ulnar
 
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Miss ulnar
um

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
how many states have an OBD type of
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
program do you know the answer to that
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
that could that be gotten for us yes
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay I would appreciate it thank you
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
out of the we just heard previous
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
testimony saying there's 36 states that
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't require uh inspection how do they
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
get away with that as far as the uh
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services well not every
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
state has experienced non non-compliance
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
with the federal ground level ozone
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
standards so some of the states probably
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
were not required to have the onboard
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
diagnostic gnostics inspection to begin
 
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.010 align:start position:0%
diagnostic gnostics inspection to begin
with

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.810 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:01.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh and other than that I don't know I
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the exact number of
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
states that have it but I will find that
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
out and get that information to the
 
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.810 align:start position:0%
out and get that information to the
committee

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you Mr
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
chair is I want to I'm not really sure
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
about this but is the entire State of
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire under the same rules for
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
emission controls
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
they the entire state is and this was
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the result of sort of an interesting
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um bartering with the EPA when when we
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
were first required to implement a
 
01:12:41.169 --> 01:12:41.179 align:start position:0%
onboard diagnostics inspection program
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
the requirement was for the southern
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
four counties which was where our our
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
major non-attainment was we had periodic
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
elevated levels in the North country
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
um the requirement was for a dynamometer
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
style testing where you actually put
 
01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
your you know drove your vehicle in and
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
it and it they would turn it on and
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
actually drive it on this Dyna
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
dynomometer and do tailpipe put a probe
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
right in the tailpipe that was right
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
around the same time that the onboard
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
diagnostic system was was incorporated
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
into all light duty vehicles and so we
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
basically made a bargain with the EPA
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
and said
 
01:13:22.490 --> 01:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
rather than do this really intrusive
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
program in the southern half of the
 
01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:25.610 align:start position:0%
program in the southern half of the
state

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the the OBD inspection only takes a
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
few minutes it's you know it's it's um
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
much quicker it's actually also more
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
effective at catching pollute catching
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
malfunctions before they cause
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
significant pollution and so as part of
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
that negotiation New Hampshire
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
implemented a Statewide program with the
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
less intrusive inspection requirement
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
rather than tailpipe dynamometer testing
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
in just the southern four counties
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you are you familiar with the
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
states that that don't have a vehicle
 
01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
inspection and I'll use Colorado as an
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
example that have Machinery placed
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
around especially metropolitan areas
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
such as Denver that will pick up
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
exhaust from Vehicles as they go by and
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
they're able to identify the vehicle by
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
their rear license plate and send out a
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
notice to the vehicle owner that they
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
need to get in and get that emissions
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
fixed I'm not aware of that
 
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.169 align:start position:0%
fixed I'm not aware of that
um

01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
I I would it sounds like that probably
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
is only addressing visible emissions
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
because it's probably spy camera because
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
I do you know I no it's it's actual they
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
they actually the tailpipe they're able
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
to grab that don't ask me how but they
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
okay they do I'm having a hard time
 
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
figuring out how that would work but no
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with that all right
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
I have one question
 
01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:53.630 align:start position:0%
I have one question
um

01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
are any federal funds at Jeopardy if
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass and if so how
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
much Highway fund money
 
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.330 align:start position:0%
much Highway fund money
uh

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know from Federal Highway
 
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
I don't know from Federal Highway
um

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
that from the I I work primarily with
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency
 
01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:17.930 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency
and

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm not aware of funding that
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
impacted by this although they could
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
they could reduce our clean air funding
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
um if we were to not implement this okay
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
is that something you could look into as
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
well absolutely thank you representative
 
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.490 align:start position:0%
well absolutely thank you representative
Coker

01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
Coker
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
are there uh in states that do have
 
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
these uh the emissions inspections is it
 
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:44.540 align:start position:0%
always required to be an annual
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
inspection are there other programs that
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
other states might have and still stay
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know the answer to that
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.450 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
committee

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow up okay and what
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
would be the consequences I mean other
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
than financial consequences is there any
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
other consequences that we would have if
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
we dropped out of the CPA program I mean
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
like is is there teeth behind it or I'm
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know other than obviously the good
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
environmental impact what being in the
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
good graces does yes I actually so now
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
that now that you frame it that way the
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
EPA or EPA could sanction the state and
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
and reduce some of our funding
 
01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:40.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the but the
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
important a very important aspect is
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
that we also would be exposing our
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
children and our elderly and our and our
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
people with respiratory issues to
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily high levels of pollution
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that dot will get in I mean
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
a DMV will get into uh failure rates I'm
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're going to talk
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
specifically about the onboard
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
diagnostics aspect or just safety but
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
um we do see even brand new vehicles
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
even you know 2022 or 2023 vehicle will
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes fail the onboard diagnostics
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
check and
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh in many ways that's doing the the
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
owner of that vehicle a service because
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
it might not have gotten to the point
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
yet where it's triggered that check
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
engine light but it it can potentially
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
do additional damage to other components
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
if allowed to go unrepaired
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
no that's fine we do have a is it EPA
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
related directly or a air directly
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of other
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
specialists in the room
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any programs that could
 
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:56.890 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any programs that could
assist

01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:56.900 align:start position:0%
assist
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
any low-income people who fail
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
inspection for these reasons
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's not an area that I work in I'm
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
not specifically aware of any
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes some Alicia Brinson
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh representing new car in opposed to
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
sorry just wasn't aware if this was on
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
but um my name is Alicia Brinson I've
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
actually worked in the automotive
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
industry for about 10 years now I'm
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
currently the service Lane manager at
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
new car auto mall in Tilton I started my
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
journey off as a technician so I
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
formally was a licensed inspector so I
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
actually did want to touch upon some of
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
the specific things that the gentleman
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
stated on the opposing view so he stated
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
that it looks like he ended up on the
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
side of the road in his Dodge Avenger
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
due to an alternator that had failed I
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
just wanted to specify that this is an
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
electrical component there's
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
realistically no way that any mechanic
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
inspector could gauge the usable life of
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
that alternator that would essentially
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
be like us going to the doctors and
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
stating hey how long am I going to live
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not something the
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
doctor could Supply us with factually
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
um if a mechanical part's broken
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not going to work all of
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
the time if there's an electrical
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
component that's failing once again
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's no way to physically be able to
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
gauge its usable life
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times too electrical
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
components might work intermittently at
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
the end of their lifetime so once again
 
01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
I just don't necessarily see the
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint of this gentleman trying to
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
state that his inspection sticker had
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
any influence on the fact that he was on
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
the side of the road with a failed
 
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.689 align:start position:0%
the side of the road with a failed
alternator

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
alternator
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
even further so I know he discussed some
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
things like compliance of time it's
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
difficult for you know what I mean
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
anybody to find time off of work to
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
comply to inspection needs realistically
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
dealerships are open a length of hours
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
even inspection stations are open until
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
six o'clock shuttle services you could
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
drop off your car have your vehicle
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
inspected pick it up at the end of your
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
work day get a shuttle service get a
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
shuttle ride or like get somebody within
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
your family your friends your workplace
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
to bring you to a facility to have your
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
inspection done so I'm not necessarily
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
seeing the fact that it's an
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
inconvenience or a Time
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive item there's a lot of things
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
that inspection stations put in place in
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
order for people to be able to do the
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
simple thing which is inspect their
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
he also did State something about Parts
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of parts being on back order or
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
not readably available this is a
 
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
hindrance with a lot of OEM Parts
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
however we do have the bandwidth to use
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
used parts aftermarket parts Rayman
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
parts so how much of the problem is that
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
in my professional opinion it's not a
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
large enough problem to create a
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
conflict there's many different ways to
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
overcome the Obstacle of not having a
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
part especially with how many you know I
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
mean local places where it's Auto Zone
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
other Auto Parts places Bow auto parts
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
use Parts aftermarket parts they're all
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
readily available to us and how many
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
parts are interchangeable from one
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle to another where we could use
 
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.570 align:start position:0%
vehicle to another where we could use
those

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that's basically what I
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to say to argue that gentleman's
 
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.090 align:start position:0%
wanted to say to argue that gentleman's
Point

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
Point
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't necessarily see the Viewpoint
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
as a perspective a lot of it's just
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
one-offs how much of the problem is it
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
is it 10 is it five percent
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
and in my professional opinion it
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily seem like it's
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
enough of a problem in that one
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
situation or even the viewpoints that he
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
said so Parts availability time and an
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
electrical component that failed
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
so the same question I asked the other
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
gentleman is the inspection sticker is
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
for that moment in time
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes and no so there are wearable items
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
that can be measured like Brakes and
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
Tires putting in perspective to 30
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
seconds for tires or below would cause
 
01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to fail inspection for
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
brakes same thing so it is a moment in
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
time but there are wearable items that
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
we can measure so example if the brakes
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
measure at two thirty seconds at that
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
time or the tires measure at 2 30
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
seconds at that time
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
that is live however
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
we can obviously know that a year's time
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
those tires are going to be
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
significantly lower
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
even if tires come in measuring putting
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
in perspective at 5 30 seconds
 
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
realistically depending on the average
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
driver 10 12 000 miles a year those
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
tires might actually be shot before the
 
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
well follow-up so another part of that
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
does new car and do other dealers that
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
you know of especially you work for new
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
car you said right
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
do they guarantee a warranty the
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
inspection up until the next inspection
 
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
inspection up until the next inspection
year

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
you do not that was the answer
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't know if he like I'm sorry
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if he cut me off and I
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak further but I was
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
actually going to State we measure
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
components on a scale of green yellow
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
and red so of course the inspection laws
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
are pretty much black and white the
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
conversation would be your vehicle
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't fail for safety requirements
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
however this may be of concern and we
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
can make an advisement for the guest or
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
customer to take care of those needs but
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
it is black and white if it fails it
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
fails if it passes it passes but we do
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
give that further analogy to the
 
01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:13.729 align:start position:0%
give that further analogy to the
customer

01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
customer
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
I've got one question I was going to
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
save it for the Department of Safety but
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think you're probably going to be able
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
to answer real easy is an alternator or
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
a generator even part of a safety
 
01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.689 align:start position:0%
a generator even part of a safety
inspection

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
it is not thank you
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
 
01:24:29.699 --> 01:24:30.709 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
chairman

01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
um so for when a car comes in for like a
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
routine like service type like an oil
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
change or something like that I've you
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
know most places give out I remember the
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
like the kind of red green whatever
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
um you know on parts that are wearing
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
out what do you think the compliance is
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
for people you know like when you give
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
that information to customers do most
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
customers act on it especially when
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're like hey this is in the red area
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
this is like or do they kind of do you
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
see them blow it off like what is your I
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
guess opinion on that I wouldn't say
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
they blow it off on average I'd say it's
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent yeah so but they do get
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
the information you know most I mean
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
most cars come in for oil changes every
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
six months or so you know or at least
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
yearly and they get that information on
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
what's wearing off on their car correct
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you
 
01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.770 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you
um

01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
so does new car have any sort of fund to
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
help people that are low income that
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
fail inspection and if not how do you
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
work with people who obviously have
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
significant financial
 
01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:39.649 align:start position:0%
significant financial
um constraints

01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
so to elaborate upon that we do have
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
finance options it's actually through a
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
program called sunbit we can't guarantee
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
what the customer would get approved for
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
obviously it's something that they would
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
have to try and we'd have to see the
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
result we do also have Factory Goodwill
 
01:25:57.850 --> 01:25:57.860 align:start position:0%
so we have five different franchises
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
within those franchise franchises excuse
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
me obviously if the customer the guest
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
had loyalty we could ask the
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to assist or even depending
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
on the Loyalty of the guest we might
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
even implement or extend
 
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.189 align:start position:0%
even implement or extend
um

01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
herbestoa gesture upon the customer to
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
help them financially with that obstacle
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
I mean representative Schultz I see the
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
direction of your questioning I think
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
when the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
comes up they can probably answer your
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
question a lot more accurately not not
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure weren't accurate but I think she
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
can be more they can be more specific
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
sellers we have seven more cards
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and they're all experts in the room
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
would you want one more question
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to confirm like I said
 
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
before there's no way you can guarantee
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
a warranty and inspection it's only for
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
that good for that one moment in time
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
she recognizes Bill Gurney from Gurney's

welcome

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman matters of the
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Bill

uh I've been doing this for 48 years or
so

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.430 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
you'll hear
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
statistics States
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm a professional technician
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm AC Master Certified
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
I've looked at
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of cars
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state inspection
 
01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state inspection
program

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
is a program that increases safety on
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
can we guarantee
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
that that car is going to be safe in a
 
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.430 align:start position:0%
that that car is going to be safe in a
year

01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee anything out of my
 
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.169 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee anything out of my
control

01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
common sense for me if I ask a question
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee and Mr chairman if I
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
said if we eliminate state inspections
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire will the
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
roads be more safe or will they be less
 
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.209 align:start position:0%
roads be more safe or will they be less
safe

01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't about just safety of that
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and that person is driving
 
01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.709 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and that person is driving
it

01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's about the safety of your family
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
if someone's driving a car
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
and those tires which are a big thing
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
especially on the rear of that car are
 
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.430 align:start position:0%
especially on the rear of that car are
not

01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
conforming to what they should be
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have zero when I say zero you have
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
zero control of that car when it breaks
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
loose from the rear that car will go 360
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
degrees and you will have zero ability
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
to control it
 
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
I have driven a car
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
in control conditions at Michelin
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
Training Center
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
on a track
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
with tires on the back of the car
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
and when that car goes you will not and
 
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to protect yourself
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
we see
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
people come in
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
their thankful
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we have noticed something in a car
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it could be a brand new car it could
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
be three months old if you hit a curb
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
you hit a pothole and you put a blemish
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
in that tire
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
you won't know that
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
but that's how it could be a maypop May
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's the best deal on Main Street to
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
have your vehicle looked at by a
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
professional technician once a year
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
confidence that it's going to be
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
safe for your family
 
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.950 align:start position:0%
safe for your family
again

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
I have looked at
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of cars over my
 
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.530 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of cars over my
lifetime

01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
and people
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
some are aware of things and they don't
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
want to fix them absolutely
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
some people get aware of them they want
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
but if you're a grandchild
 
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
is in the car ahead of that person with
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
the bad tires
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
you will not
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
ever recover from that
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
I am certainly open to any questions
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
um regarding this but again are the
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
roads safer
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
or less safe by eliminating the statue
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir questions from
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:12.290 align:start position:0%
the committee
representative

01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
Gurney how um what percentage can you
 
01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
give me me a ballpark figure of what
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
percentage of vehicles that come into
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't give you a figure that I'm
 
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
not comfortable I cannot give you that
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
figure I know the state has the figure
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the failures
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I could get that figure if you asked
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
me to and I could get that to the
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee but I don't want to make
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
something up I'm not a person that will
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
I don't want to guess okay all right can
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
I have just
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
um did you want to follow up yes please
 
01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.950 align:start position:0%
um did you want to follow up yes please
um

01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things are are Vehicles
 
01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:54.739 align:start position:0%
most likely to fail on
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know tires are certainly a big one
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
brakes are certainly a big one uh
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
suspension parts yeah steering and uh
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
suspension parts certainly a big one
 
01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:06.709 align:start position:0%
suspension parts certainly a big one
um

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
in New England and New Hampshire rust
 
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
structural rust so
 
01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:13.820 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
the frames on some of these cars and we
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
have inspected cars that we tell
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
customers listen they're not safe for
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
your family do not fix and we don't want
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
you to fix it we don't want them to
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
spend money with us we want them to get
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
a different car they're not
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
safe for the road and they don't know
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
that because a frame as long as it's
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
together you're not going to see it as
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
soon as you get an accident and and that
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
rear bump is support or that rear frame
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
that guy folds up like an accordion and
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
you lose a child
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.930 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
committee

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Gurney for
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question kind of
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
dovetails Representative stobs question
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
how many cars have you seen
 
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
in regards to inspections that you've
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
said to yourself oh my goodness this car
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
should not be in the road
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
oh again I don't have a number so
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
whatever I say is subjective a lot I
 
01:33:22.679 --> 01:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
whatever I say is subjective a lot I
mean

01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
there are cars that should not be on the
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
road and not for us to fix they
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on the road period and
 
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
someone's going to get hurt or someone
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time Mr
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your time members
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes Bob Scully
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Motor Transport
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
Association opposed to the bills seeking
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Bob
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
Scully president New Hampshire Motor
 
01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
Transport Association I just want to
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
clarify it's um a point on here so
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
in the methodology section of the bill
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
Define what a commercial motor vehicle
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
is so just so the committee understands
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
the definition of commercial Motor
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
Vehicles start at ten thousand pounds
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
so trucks between ten thousand pounds
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
and 26 000 pounds according to this
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
proposed piece of legislation would be
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
exempt okay and that would violate
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um Federal code I'll give you the exact
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:43.100 align:start position:0%
396.17 in the federal quota regulations
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
sites those vehicles that have to be
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
inspected annually so so we would be in
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
violation at least the industry that I
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
represent a federal law if you pass this
 
01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
bill at least with that language in it
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
and then my second concern
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
which is different than other speakers
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
is on your fiscal impact you know the
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
loss of 4.2 million dollars in a highway
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.930 align:start position:0%
loss of 4.2 million dollars in a highway
fund

01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the house Public Works committee
 
01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
deals more with some of the highway
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
funding issues but with the reduction in
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
the highway fund the electric vehicles
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
the hybrid vehicles that travel on our
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
on our roads um
 
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
the highway fund monies are slowly
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
dwindling so I would offer to you that I
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
think this is a grave concern so those
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
are the two reasons why I pose this
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you Mr
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
chair I I maybe I'm missing something
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
but reading this bill
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
online two it says the director may
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
require the inspection of any vehicle
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
which requires a commercial driver's
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
license to operate
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
don't you have to have a commercial
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license for everything 10 000
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
pounds and up in my correct for that no
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a commercial
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
driver's license for that you need a
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's license for vehicles
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
over twenty six thousand pounds you need
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
to be in drug testing over twenty six
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds you can drive eight
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle under 26 000
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
pounds with a regular operator's license
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I I I guess I guess it's
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
been my bad experience to be stopped in
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
in a box truck by state police
 
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.930 align:start position:0%
in a box truck by state police
inspectors

01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
um who think that my truck is over ten
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds uh in which it's not but
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing they look at is
 
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
is the is the weight and and they're
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
asking me for a CDL so I guess my
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
question is is everybody else aware of
 
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.830 align:start position:0%
question is is everybody else aware of
that

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for folks from the
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety here they can
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm I would tell you I'm terribly
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
surprised that you've had a 10 000 pound
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle when I asked for a CDL license
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you you can hold on to that one
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
till we get safety
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes Dan Goodman
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
from AAA
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
the card says you support the bill and
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
would you like me to change it yes
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
yeah uh my my apologies uh for the
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dan Goodman I
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
represent AAA of Northern New England
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
and we we are here in opposition to the
 
01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.830 align:start position:0%
and we we are here in opposition to the
bill

01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I was just in a rush to get
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
here I was all excited
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
um we historically advocate for bills
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
that make New Hampshire roads safer
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the sole reason why we here
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
we feel that if you repeal the vehicle
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
inspection uh mandate this will make the
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
roads for all users less safe uh back in
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
1966 AAA helped draft the national
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
highway safety act which was the
 
01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:06.860 align:start position:0%
included in that was the first national
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
standards for motor vehicle inspections
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
and we recognized back in 1966 and we
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
recognized in 2023 the importance of
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections they keep our roads
 
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
safe they are very vital to keep our
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
road safe in fact
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
um each year AAA Automotive
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
professionals and sometimes myself we
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
travel around New Hampshire and we do
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
free pre-winter checkups that are
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
different branches throughout the state
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
where we check brakes steering
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
components lights tires and other issues
 
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm usually a one checking the tire
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
gauges that's my experience that's as
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
much as my expertise is and at these
 
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:48.659 align:start position:0%
events I can tell you we see countless
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
ball tires bad brakes
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
bad exhaust systems and we hear
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
countless times people just asking you
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
sure we can't get through the winter
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
with these tires or these ball tires and
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
I mean we're there just advising them
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
and trying to help them prepare for the
 
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
and trying to help them prepare for the
winter

01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
winter
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so we see it firsthand hundreds of
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
times every winter
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
um and as was mentioned previously we
 
01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
think this is a fantastic deal to have a
 
01:39:16.129 --> 01:39:16.139 align:start position:0%
trusted professional mechanic look at
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
your vehicle for a very good deal they
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
conduct a very comprehensive inspection
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
on your vehicle for a modest price so
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just end with that that we oppose
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
this and we I'm happy to answer any
 
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.330 align:start position:0%
this and we I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Coker
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chairman uh so do you
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
would you say that there's a lot of
 
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:39.860 align:start position:0%
availability for
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
anybody you know anybody with a vehicle
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
to get their car inspected
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
um you know without some kind of a
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
mandate I mean it seems like there's you
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
know the routine oil changes but there's
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
just so many touch points that most
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
people are going to get their car
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
inspected at
 
01:39:59.330 --> 01:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
um do you think that people would would
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
do that less if there wasn't an
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
inspection yearly
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's a
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
little beyond my expertise there are
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
people from the from the dealers and uh
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh that could answer that better but I
 
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
would say in highway safety whether it's
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
impaired driving laws teen driver laws
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
um there's to change people's behaviors
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
it takes three legs that we call it like
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
the the stool you have education
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
um engineering and enforcement so
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
without that enforcement you don't
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
change behavior and so we feel if like
 
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
there wasn't that that mandate that that
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
behavior wouldn't change and they would
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
drive with unsafe Vehicles all right
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you Mr
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%

01:40:52.570 --> 01:40:52.580 align:start position:0%
question I asked you you may remember
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
the last time you testified you said the
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
AAA is opposed to this are we talking
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
about the AAA membership or are we
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
talking about the AAA board of directors
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's great to
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
see you as well and I appreciate the
 
01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
see you as well and I appreciate the
question

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
um it never it never gets old I'm happy
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
um every every bill
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so AAA before we started helping
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
everyone the 527 000 members of New
 
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roadside we started as a a
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
public policy advocacy organization that
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's where our roots are before we're
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
helping people in emergency roadside it
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
was a it was a group of individuals who
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
the roads were not suitable for cars
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
they were suitable for horses and so
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
they got together and they advocated
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
their state legislators and the national
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
legislators to let's work on making the
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
roads safer for vehicles
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so we've always been advocating for
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
policies to make our roads and highways
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
safer for all users so that's just been
 
01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
in our roots to always and I know it's
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
for some people it's it's we're they're
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
curious on why we're there but we feel
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
that's in aaa's DNA to advocate for
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
policies uh relate we feel like the
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
sure follow-up thank you but you didn't
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
answer my question uh directly I I want
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
to know did you take a survey of the
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
members of AAA in the state of New
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with regards to this bill or
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
is this something that in their your
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
safety thoughts the board of directors
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I would say
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
that we did not survey members on this
 
01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.790 align:start position:0%
that we did not survey members on this
issue

01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:47.219 align:start position:0%
Goodman for uh actually all I want was
 
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:51.860 align:start position:0%
you mentioned three stooled leg
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
got that slightly backwards but I only
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
caught two of them so could you just
 
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
repeat the all three
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative engineering enforcement
 
01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.709 align:start position:0%
representative engineering enforcement
okay

01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
an edge of sellers
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
so the would you say it's true that
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
these vehicles that you're seeing you
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
know that you do these somewhat
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
pre-inspections with with bad tires or
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
something else going wrong with them
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
these are vehicles that have already
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
been inspected previously
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
sometime during the year
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
that is something that we don't we don't
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.729 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
much

01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%

01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill looking forward three minutes to
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman Walsh and committee
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
members I am Tracy borvage I'm the
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
president of a New Hampshire motorcycle
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
rides organization also known as an hmro
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
and we are in opposition of this bill
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
I want to give you a quick synopsis of
 
01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.770 align:start position:0%
I want to give you a quick synopsis of
why

01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
the last time an industry survey was
 
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
done by the motorcycle inspection
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
failure people to be able to inspect
 
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
motorcycles it was roughly 30 percent of
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
the motorcycles that failed inspections
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
how a rider rides determines how a back
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
tire of a motorcycle wears
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's a statement you want to think
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
about a little bit how much weight a
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
rider carries on their motorcycle
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
is a factor
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
how many miles they put on it is a
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
factor and every Rider rides different
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
and every Rider rides a lot differently
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
in a summertime or a season and seasons
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
are different for every Rider
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most Riders do not know
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
how to to check their their tire tread
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
depth most motorcycles don't even know
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
how to check a lot of things on their
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
motorcycle especially anymore we have a
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
lot of new riders coming in
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
writing especially in the with what's
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
happened and occurred with the pandemic
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of new riders coming in
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to work on their
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
motorcycles they know how to check
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
anything on their motorcycles and that's
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't take much truly to the
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
imagination to think about the tragic
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
consequences on a motorcycle if our tire
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
or our brake system fail
 
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:41.699 align:start position:0%
those are two things that are key
 
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
important elements when we get our
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.570 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
representing the motorcycles we want to
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
know that the other vehicles obviously
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the roadways are inspected because
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
when we're on the roadways with them we
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want someone's brakes to
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
fail and take us out so that's important
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
to us as well
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
and I want to share with you something
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
being part of nhmro that we're proud of
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
we started a motorcycle safety task
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
force along with the Department of
 
01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.649 align:start position:0%
force along with the Department of
Safety

01:46:20.649 --> 01:46:20.659 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
we started this we brought in the New
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of Highway uh safety we
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
brought in the State Police we brought
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
in AAA of Northern New England New
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
I heart media The Liquor Commission the
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
writers education program
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
and we started the ride smart safety
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
program which has now been about adopted
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
by the state and it's actually going to
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
end up being adopted by Nitza
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
and we talk about writing smart
 
01:46:52.810 --> 01:46:52.820 align:start position:0%
safely or totally aware excuse me
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully entrained and our key
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
component would safely talks about
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
checking our tires our brake systems but
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can't do that alone the Riders are
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
just not capable of doing that they're
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
not they're not going to most writers
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
will get on their motorcycle at the
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of that season and not think
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
about checking their tires they just
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
don't and I'm going to tell you as
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
president of New Hampshire motorcycle
 
01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
rights and my husband's sitting right
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
here behind me a lot of times I don't I
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
just I get on that motorcycle I want to
 
01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'm anxious to get on it and I just
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't take a look at that tire
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
so we believe in the inspections we
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
believe that they do work and they are
 
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.570 align:start position:0%
believe that they do work and they are
important

01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
so we are in opposition the other one
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
last component of this is that 4.2
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we lose to protect
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
our roads
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
our roads up here quite frankly
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes suck for us as motorcyclists
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
we need our roads to be safe for us to
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
ride so it's a key important to keep
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
that money in the highway safety fund so
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
we have safe roads for us
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford thank you Mr
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
chair could I get a copy of that of the

um
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start out by saying or
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
asking who is responsible for your
 
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
asking who is responsible for your
safety

01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
is the government responsible for your
 
01:48:55.619 --> 01:48:56.930 align:start position:0%
is the government responsible for your
safety

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
is it someone else is it the police is
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
it your parents is it your spouse who is
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
responsible for your safety
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh driving is uh essentially the most
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous activity that I know of that
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh people engage in on a regular basis
 
01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.470 align:start position:0%
uh people engage in on a regular basis
and

01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to bring some figures from
 
01:49:27.129 --> 01:49:27.139 align:start position:0%
the national highway
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration uh into
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
this conversation to help
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
guide our understanding of exactly what
 
01:49:40.330 --> 01:49:40.340 align:start position:0%
sort of good or bad this bill could do
 
01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
sort of good or bad this bill could do
[Music]

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.689 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
according to the national highway
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration
 
01:49:49.139 --> 01:49:49.729 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration
um

01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
42 915 people died
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and fatal car crashes in 2021 that
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
um now if we assumed all of those people
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
were residents of New Hampshire that
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
would be about three percent of our
 
01:50:07.139 --> 01:50:08.510 align:start position:0%
would be about three percent of our
population

01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
but that's the entirety of the United
 
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
States so that's about uh point zero one
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the population of the entire
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
United States okay what were the causes
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
according to the national highway
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration they said
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
the causes were drunk driving lack of
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
seat belt use speeding distracted
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
driving and drowsy driving
 
01:50:35.090 --> 01:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay removing
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
the state inspections addresses uh
 
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
exactly none of these okay the state
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
inspections they're not inspecting uh
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
that drivers are awake while they're
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
driving they're not inspecting drivers
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
are not drunk while they're driving
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're not inspecting drivers uh seat
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
belts if the seat belts work or if they
 
01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:56.780 align:start position:0%
put their seat belts on
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's motto here is Live Free
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
or Die
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh as exemplified by our lack of a uh
 
01:51:11.209 --> 01:51:11.219 align:start position:0%
seat belt law
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislators trust New
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to be responsible
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
for their own safety
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
so that is uh the main potatoes of my
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm willing to take any
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm just a member of the
 
01:51:26.639 --> 01:51:28.669 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm just a member of the
public

01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
the most important members
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:43.250 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
foreign

01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes Dan Bennett New
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Auto Dealers Association
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.280 --> 01:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I will be
 
01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:04.970 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I will be
ready

01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I do have a handout uh there's some
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
pretty pictures on there but there's
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
also some really good data that I'd like
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
you all to see I'll make reference to in
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony again Dan Bennett New
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Auto Dealers Association and
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
Hada is a trade group representing the
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle industry we are 500
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
businesses uh car trucks snowmobile ATV
 
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
construction farm equipment Collision
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
repairs amongst others so
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
once again as always nhada opposes this
 
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
legislation we have in the past for the
 
01:52:37.689 --> 01:52:37.699 align:start position:0%
multiple times it's been
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
presented including when we opposed it
 
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:42.380 align:start position:0%
last year when this committee wisely
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
italed the bill 18 nothing and it uh
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
passed the house on the consent calendar
 
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
so a few points that I'll mention
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
um vehicle inspections catch recalls
 
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
that save consumers money okay the
 
01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:57.179 align:start position:0%
safety inspection program that we have
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire last year alerted
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
citizens to 200 over 224 000 open safety
 
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
recalls on their vehicles those are open
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
safety recalls whose cost to repair are
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
covered by the manufacturer so the
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection program New Hampshire
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
actually saves saves consumers money
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Nitza studies show the mechanical
 
01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:21.179 align:start position:0%
defects or worn equipment on vehicles
 
01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:23.300 align:start position:0%
was a causative or aggravating factor in
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
12.6 percent
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
crashes so that's a pretty high
 
01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.470 align:start position:0%
crashes so that's a pretty high
percentage

01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire rate actually went up
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
last year it's now at 14.4 percent you
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
can see from the chart on the back we
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
have a year-over-year comparison
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
including the items that information
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
graciously surprised supplied by the DMV
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
a Pennsylvania study in 09 concluded
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
that safety inspections play a
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
significant role in saving lives uh it
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
stated that the Pennsylvania inspection
 
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
program has reduced the number of fatal
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
crashes by 115 to 169 saving 127 to 177
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
lives on an annual basis so it's our
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
opinion that if the safety inspection
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
program saves one life it's worth it so
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the acceptable number
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
would be based on stuff that I've heard
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
so preventative maintenance saves money
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
right so it's like an annual checkup
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
with your doctor
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
um you know breaks Brakes and Tires can
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know 300 repair if you have a
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic failure the front end it
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
could cost three thousand dollars so
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
that simple checkup actually saves money
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the long run
 
01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
um all of our neighboring states have
 
01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
safety inspections
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know you cannot compare us to
 
01:54:41.649 --> 01:54:41.659 align:start position:0%
Florida or Arizona or or other states
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
further Evidence by the the map that I
 
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
have uh and the information comes from
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
dot here it's actually a winter severity
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
rating so some folks say uh you know
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
well uh Colorado and Minnesota have
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
snowy Winters they do but when you look
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
at in total the severity of the winters
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
we have uh 50 degree days in January and
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
it's going to be negative 25 this
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
weekend right so we have these massive
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
ranges so you can't really compare us to
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
all those others you have to look at the
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
New England region where a little micro
 
01:55:15.169 --> 01:55:15.179 align:start position:0%
climate and you can see you know it's
 
01:55:15.179 --> 01:55:16.370 align:start position:0%
climate and you can see you know it's
actually

01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know Blazing Red meaning
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly severe you know a lot of
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
those other states Don't Spray liquid
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
salt water on their roads in the winter
 
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
road brine the way that we do so it does
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
a unique amount of damage to Vehicles
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.530 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
um

01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned before again uh 500 000
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
loss to to local municipalities and then
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
4.2 million dollars to the state highway
 
01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.350 align:start position:0%
4.2 million dollars to the state highway
fund

01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
um it's an incredible hold to fill
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
um so again this is problematic
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
um we did talk about the the emissions
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
testing system was was mentioned
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so we can talk about that you know we
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
do have a federal requirement to do that
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
annual testing the safety inspection and
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
the OBD2 testing process are tied
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
together the method with which we do
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
OBD2 testing and Reporting is tied to
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
the annual safety inspection program so
 
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
with that safety inspection goes away so
 
01:56:12.129 --> 01:56:12.139 align:start position:0%
does our emissions testing program
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
putting us in violation and emission
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
reductions is a pretty simple concept
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
right once you get on a diet you stay on
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
a diet
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
and that's why we do it so that we don't
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
backslide with our clean air we may be
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
meeting it now but we need to make sure
 
01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:27.260 align:start position:0%
that we stay that way
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
the bill also wipes out an issue that
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
you heard a few weeks ago this bill also
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
wipes out in all inspections for antique
 
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:35.149 align:start position:0%
wipes out in all inspections for antique
vehicles

01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and then the question was asked
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
before about low-income individuals
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
there's the OBD2 testing system just so
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know does have an economic hardship
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
waiver process through the DMV if
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
repairs cannot be afforded so
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
um sorry if I stole your thunder
 
01:56:52.679 --> 01:56:53.510 align:start position:0%
um sorry if I stole your thunder
um

01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
you know I heard mention of the New
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have a seat belt law
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
um you know you're not wearing your
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
seatbelt won't kill me right but your
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
bad breaks in a car that's going 80 000
 
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
or 80 miles an hour that weighs 3 000
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
pounds potentially will so uh something
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
to consider you know it you've you've
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
got a number of roadway safety Advocates
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
here that that are opposed to the bill
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
um including Triple A nhmro the New
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Traffic Safety commission also
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this pistol legislation
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to it
 
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.770 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to it
um

01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
I guess really uh and trying to address
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
any of the questions that you all had
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
that's really my testimony just
 
01:57:35.930 --> 01:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
um once again you know uh in the name of
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
of safe roads a Cornerstone issue for
 
01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
nhada whether it's this or motorcycle
 
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
rider education or or the texting while
 
01:57:43.739 --> 01:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
rider education or or the texting while
driving

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:47.219 align:start position:0%
um you know we we support safe roads in
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and and we oppose this legislation
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and it
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
would not be complete without a question
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
from representative Saint Claire
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you Mr chair you
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned something that I the last time
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
I was on this committee I remember the
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
chair brought this very topic up have
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
your and we know that this affects
 
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Safety have your 500 businesses
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
are taking a position on this uh maybe
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
Banning this liquid brime that's being
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
put on our highways in the name of
 
01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
put on our highways in the name of
safety

01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair it's not the one
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
I thought that was coming but I'll do my
 
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.750 align:start position:0%
I thought that was coming but I'll do my
best

01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
we have not taken our association has
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
not taken a position for or against Road
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
brine we have looked at the issue and
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
we've looked at its impact on vehicles
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
there was a bill filed a few years ago
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
but I believe by the chairman I believe
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
maybe turn into a study committee we
 
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
were involved and and part of and part
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
of that discussion
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
um so we're interested in following the
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue however we have not picked in a
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
position for or against that practice
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
and policy
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you before the record it
 
01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:03.659 align:start position:0%
is magnesium chloride it's it's a
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
wonderful stuff any other questions from
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
the committee representative sellers
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
you said uh uh you mentioned about
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
recalls uh
 
01:59:15.609 --> 01:59:15.619 align:start position:0%
do you know if every inspection station
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
checks for recalls
 
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question as long as
 
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
the vehicle goes through the uh Gordon
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
Darby and host sifsum which we do OBD2
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
testing it's a requirement of that
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
program that every single vehicle that
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
goes through that system receives a
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
safety inspection so last year a total
 
01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.330 align:start position:0%
safety inspection so last year a total
of

01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
of
uh

01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh one million 237
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
000 and change Vehicles went through the
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
system and over 224 000 of them found
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just trying to be aware on on
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
brake systems I I believe there's at
 
01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:00.649 align:start position:0%
brake systems I I believe there's at
least

02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:00.659 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
a redundancy usually front brakes from
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
rear bearings are two different systems
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
so if one failed you still have the
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
other but on some vehicles and
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
especially I'm talking cars they could
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
even have four wheel independent braking
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh at that point so even if you had one
 
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:17.870 align:start position:0%
uh at that point so even if you had one
fill

02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
fill
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
is is it do you know if there the others
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
would still be working is that correct
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think I'd
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
probably rather defer that uh to someone
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
a little more technical than me you
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
bikes and skis are another issue but
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other questions thank you
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes in support of the
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.820 --> 02:01:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
hi everybody thank you for having me
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm here supporting myself uh or
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
representing myself for uh the uh to
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
support the bill hb646
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
um one of the problems with the state
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
inspection system is the regulations
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
themselves are
 
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh often vague
 
02:01:26.770 --> 02:01:26.780 align:start position:0%
um open to interpretation
 
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
and many of them have absolutely nothing
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
to do with safety
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the other problem you have is there
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
are dishonest mechanics in the state who
 
02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:39.950 align:start position:0%
are dishonest mechanics in the state who
uh

02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
have tried to defraud people
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
um in saying they need a break job when
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
they clearly don't
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and one of the problems with the
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
state system is there's no appeal
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
process if you disagree
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
um there's really no way to uh
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
to get a second opinion
 
02:02:01.739 --> 02:02:04.129 align:start position:0%
to get a second opinion
um

02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh I actually worked for one of New
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's largest Automotive companies
 
02:02:11.089 --> 02:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh for several years although I was not
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
a professional mechanic I purchased a
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
new vehicle from them while I was
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
employed there
 
02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.930 align:start position:0%
employed there
um

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
and because of my birthday uh just a
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
couple months after I purchased it I had
 
02:02:24.729 --> 02:02:24.739 align:start position:0%
to bring it in for a re-inspection and
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
usually I am a do-it-yourselfer who's
 
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
done pretty much everything from
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
transmission repairs and engine rebuilds
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
and welding and all sort of things and
 
02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
I've usually driven older vehicles and
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's always been a hassle almost every
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
year for the first time I'm like all
 
02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
right I got a almost brand new car it's
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
under warranty what could possibly go
 
02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
under warranty what could possibly go
wrong

02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.129 align:start position:0%
wrong
um

02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
I get a phone call from the service
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
advisor hey you need a um you need new
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
front brakes to pass inspection
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm like that's weird because when I
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
bought the car you guys told me it had
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
new brakes all the way around so either
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
you're lying to me then or you're lying
 
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
to me now which one is it I want to go
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
see those breaks for myself and I ran
 
02:03:11.689 --> 02:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
into the the shop to go look at my truck
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and um find the mechanic scrambling to
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
put the inspection sticker on my truck
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
and I got a written
 
02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:21.709 align:start position:0%
and I got a written
um

02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh estimate for
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
923 dollars
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
um for new breaks that turns out I
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
didn't need because a year later
 
02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
uh when it was time to get my inspection
 
02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
sticker yet again I said well they
 
02:03:40.609 --> 02:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
barely passed last year
 
02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
um they probably aren't going to pass
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
this year I should just preemptively do
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
them even though they haven't been
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
problematic yet
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
and I was surprised to find that
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
although the um
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
they were indeed wearing unevenly which
 
02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
is what the mechanic told me was wrong
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
um they still had well well uh over the
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh they were well well within the limit
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
of what you needed for breaks so I
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
almost you know and and I'm just
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
wondering well if this is what they
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
do to somebody they know and they know I
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
work on my own cars and stuff
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and they know me there uh what are
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
they doing to your average grandmother
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
who doesn't really know better and is
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to just take their word for it you
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
know I could have been out an
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
unnecessary nine hundred dollars when I
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
could have probably gotten even more
 
02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:35.719 align:start position:0%
time out of those breaks
 
02:04:35.719 --> 02:04:37.370 align:start position:0%
time out of those breaks
and

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's a I've emailed all of you
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's a list of states that have
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
already gotten rid of their inspection
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
processes New Hampshire is only one of a
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
few states that still has one
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think we need it anymore
 
02:04:55.090 --> 02:04:55.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that the risk to
 
02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
and I think that the risk to
[Music]

02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
um fraud and uh
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the other problem is sometimes
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
people are like I just need to get one
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
more year out of my car or six months
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
out of my car I'm just trying to save
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
every penny I can to have a down payment
 
02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
for my next vehicle and they can either
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
take you know a thousand dollars and put
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
it towards an unnecessary repair on the
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're planning on getting rid
 
02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:16.970 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're planning on getting rid
of

02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
or they could put it towards their new
 
02:05:19.139 --> 02:05:20.030 align:start position:0%
or they could put it towards their new
car

02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I think this really this uh this
 
02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
really harms uh you know the poor people
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and people who don't know their cars
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant James O'Leary represent the
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
state police opposed to the bill seeking
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:02.750 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
committee

02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of testimony and
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
opposition at Bill and I'm not going to
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
repeat those points just know that we're
 
02:06:09.410 --> 02:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
in support of what those were I do want
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
to bring to light just a different
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
perspective from what Troop G does and
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
and as we've talked about before we are
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
tasked for providing enforcement and
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
Licensing oversight to both dealerships
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
and inspection stations and as such we
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
are also the repository for consumer
 
02:06:25.129 --> 02:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
complaints regarding the purchase of
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
unsafe motor vehicles and oftentimes
 
02:06:29.089 --> 02:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
consumers will purchase a used motor
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle and later find that the vehicle
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
is unsafe for the roadway due to a
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons the vehicle
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
deficiencies are only discovered due to
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
the completion of a state mandated
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
inspection this is where investigators
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
from Troop G become involved and
 
02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
depending on circumstances conduct an
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
investigation regarding the proper sale
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle without the mandated
 
02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
state inspection that occurs at the time
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
of new ownership of the vehicle the
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
average consumer may not be aware of any
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical issues affecting its safe
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
operation furthermore it may not be
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
until months later when the vehicle is
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
brought in for service that a mechanical
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
issue is discovered the time that lapses
 
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
be between the time of purchase to the
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
revelation of such a safety issue not
 
02:07:08.570 --> 02:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
only puts the consumer and the motoring
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
public at risk it also decreases the
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
probability that a buyer is held
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
accountable for or the seller rather is
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
held accountable for potential criminal
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
or civil penalties if warranted
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
although this law would not prevent
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
individuals from seeking an inspection
 
02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
on their own the safety of our roadways
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
would be Reliant upon those individuals
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
having such an inspection conducted
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'll close with the last speaker spoke
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
about not having an appeals process and
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a something that we hear about a
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot obviously because there are you know
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
just like in any business individuals
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
that you know claim work needs to be
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
done and what have you Troop G also is a
 
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
repository for those types of calls as
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
well so if somebody does have a vehicle
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
inspected and they don't agree with what
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
the outcome is we field calls regarding
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
those inspections such inspections and
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
we'll conduct an investigation upon
 
02:07:56.689 --> 02:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
finding out whether or not that vehicle
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
should or should not have passed
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
inspection and proceed accordingly
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.689 --> 02:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative Jones
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for coming thank
 
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for coming thank
you

02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask the uh the attorney
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
general has the Department of Consumer
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
Affairs are they in touch with you when
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
these type of things happen thank you
 
02:08:22.609 --> 02:08:22.619 align:start position:0%
for your question yes sir we do work in
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
conjunction with uh the Attorney
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
General's office when it comes to such
 
02:08:25.619 --> 02:08:27.709 align:start position:0%
General's office when it comes to such
complaints

02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
I do have one question
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
because I've heard the story from the
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
previous testimony before how would the
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
average person know who to contact if
 
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
they wanted to question whether or not a
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
a failure was was appropriate thank you
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for your question so typically
 
02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
what happens is the average consumer
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
will go to the DMV website and they'll
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
find the dealer inspection number
 
02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
they'll call the phone number for the
 
02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
dealer inspection desk and that's how
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
that information gets relayed down to us
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions yeah
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative I saw Sinclair first yep
 
02:09:04.209 --> 02:09:04.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just for the record
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh when a State Trooper makes a traffic
 
02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.649 align:start position:0%
uh when a State Trooper makes a traffic
stop

02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%
stop
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I they usually will see what they'll
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
look at the sticker normal procedure but
 
02:09:17.089 --> 02:09:17.099 align:start position:0%
by seeing there's a current inspection
 
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
sticker on there do they then at that
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
point neglect or purposely not look at
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
other tires and things like that at the
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
particular moment of that stop thank you
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair for your
 
02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
question uh no that wouldn't be accurate
 
02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:32.099 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes we'll find that there
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
are items that may have been changed
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
since then so for example if an
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
inspection is done and somebody changes
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
their tires or tints their windows or
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
changes their headlights or many things
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know factor into that we would
 
02:09:44.689 --> 02:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
see that there were potential other
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
items that again that we could see
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
visibly that did not meet state
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
inspection criteria thank you welcome
 
02:09:53.089 --> 02:09:53.099 align:start position:0%
representative representative Sykes
 
02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
lieutenant O'Leary for taking my
 
02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.129 align:start position:0%
lieutenant O'Leary for taking my
question

02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm making a presumption here so I
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
believe that there are posters inside
 
02:10:08.689 --> 02:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
inspection stations that might talk
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
about the price they may talk about
 
02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
procedures or whatever
 
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
is there any information on these
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
required if
 
02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
are there required post component of the
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
poster to say if you have a complaint
 
02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:26.099 align:start position:0%
about the procedures here to call this
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
number thank you representative response
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
for your questions there is there is not
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um they are given they're supposed to be
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
given an outline or a quote for the
 
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
items that need to be repaired however
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
there is not information to my knowledge
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
that speaks to
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
um contacting either DMV or State Police
 
02:10:46.689 --> 02:10:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.699 --> 02:10:48.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you lieutenant Larry for

taking my question yes sir in terms of
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
handling the the appeals how many
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
appeals did you hear or got involved
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
with let's say in the past past year
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
question unfortunately I don't have the
 
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
answer for that so essentially what
 
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
happens for our troop those those
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions will come in or
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
and uh those get distributed accordingly
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
to the Troopers and the AIS to go up and
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
follow up on I just don't have the

numbers with me today but I could get
 
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
them if you'd like them sure
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
further questions

thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
committee my name is John marasco I'm
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
the director of The Division of Motor
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
Vehicles along with registration
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
supervisor Jeff overdeck we do oppose
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
the bill the mission of the New
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV is safe drivers safe
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles and safe roadways our annual
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
inspection requirement helps us fulfill
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
all of those objectives the handout that
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
you received from Supervisor over dank
 
02:12:08.689 --> 02:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
captures three years worth of data from
 
02:12:11.689 --> 02:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
Gordon Darby which captures all the
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
inspection information throughout the
 
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
state as you'll see within that document
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are failures and categories such
 
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
as breaks steering and tires obviously
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
those are concerning categories that we
 
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
want to make sure Vehicles aren't on the
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
road if they have deficiencies in those
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
areas this bill when reading it
 
02:12:33.169 --> 02:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
would eliminate well over a million
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections per year and if you
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
also within the handout you see that
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
roughly a quarter million vehicles
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
um in any given year could have
 
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that would be problematic
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
and may translate into the vehicle not
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
fit for the roadway roughly 14 percent
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more than that of
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
vehicles don't pass the annual state
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
inspection and so for that we oppose the
 
02:12:59.450 --> 02:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
bill we think the model that we have
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
works and it helps fulfill that model of
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
safe drivers safe vehicles and safe
 
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
roadways there are some technical
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
defects with the bill that supervisor
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
oberdeen could speak to
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
committee and I won't uh I won't belabor
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
going over other pieces of testimony
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
that we had as a number of folks have
 
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
made those points today but what I do
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
want to do is a quick lesson on
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
commercial driver licensing and what
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
that means to this bill and what it
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
means to us when we think of CDL and
 
02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill specifically
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
labels out is that those
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles that require a CDL would be the
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
only ones left in the program
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um everyone thinks of the twenty six
 
02:13:43.609 --> 02:13:43.619 align:start position:0%
thousand and one pound plus vehicle up
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
we think of the Walmart tractor trailer
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Continental Paving truck hauling
 
02:13:49.129 --> 02:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
pavement down the road what we don't
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
think of is what uh Bob Scully mentioned
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
earlier and that's the the fastest
 
02:13:55.729 --> 02:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
growing portion of the commercial
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
vehicle segment and we call them CDL
 
02:14:01.010 --> 02:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
beaters because manufacturers are
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing vehicles of large size
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
that specifically don't require a CDL so
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
for instance vehicles that are twenty
 
02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
six thousand one pounds plus require a
 
02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.810 align:start position:0%
six thousand one pounds plus require a
cdlb

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
cdlb
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
and now they're manufacturing those
 
02:14:17.629 --> 02:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
exact same vehicles at 25 900 pounds so
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
now those drivers aren't required to go
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
through the CDL testing and do those
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
other things that other CDL drivers are
 
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
required to do but that segment that
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is a 10 0001
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
to 26 000 pound category think of your
 
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
plumber Sprinter van think of your uh
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
electrician's van or your F-450 or 550
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
in landscaping in that category not
 
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
required to have a commercial license
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
but they are required to have a medical
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
card and they are in the game as far as
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
FMCSA is concerned
 
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
so by eliminating the inspections for
 
02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles number one it takes us
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
out of the pool for Federal grant money
 
02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
which we just use for our new IRP
 
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
program for that apportion plate program
 
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
that we put into play that allows
 
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
carriers to do their their registrations
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
online that was paid for by the feds
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
because we are compliant didn't come out
 
02:15:12.290 --> 02:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
of our pocket came out of theirs
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
most importantly if we're not putting
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers on those vehicles in
 
02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:19.619 align:start position:0%
the ten thousand one to twenty six
 
02:15:21.649 --> 02:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
thousand pound category
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
they can't leave the state
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
think about that all of those businesses
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
that can't leave the state because those
 
02:15:29.930 --> 02:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
commercial Motor Vehicles are not
 
02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
commercial Motor Vehicles are not
inspected

02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's the outlying piece here with this
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the 26001 plus that we're
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with what we are but it's a
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
ten thousand one to twenty six thousand
 
02:15:46.129 --> 02:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
pound category because they are required
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
to have inspection stickers and all of
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
those other states that they go in
 
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:53.099 align:start position:0%
so to provide that opportunity for that
 
02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
category it can remain in compliance and
 
02:15:58.490 --> 02:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
be eligible for interstate commerce
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
we need to continue that inspection
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
program for that segment of vehicles as
 
02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:02.870 align:start position:0%
program for that segment of vehicles as
well

02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
having said that I'll answer any
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
questions the board may have
 
02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:08.099 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Jones
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
um in our fiscal notes uh it says you
 
02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
would be a loss of 4.2 million dollars
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
How would
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
you as a department
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
make up for that would you have to
 
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
increase rates somewhere else or would
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
you be laying people off or how would
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
that affect you
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
that part of the budget is up to three
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
percent of our Federal Highway funds and
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
where and how that's distributed is up
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and who and how
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative value
 
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
um are there situations where a vehicle
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
might weigh more than twenty six
 
02:16:53.089 --> 02:16:53.099 align:start position:0%
thousand one pounds that where you
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need a CDL to operate it that
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
would put it outside this inspection
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
requirement uh thank you for the
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
question it's a great question we think
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
of those uh all those campers that are
 
02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
not involved in Commerce you have and
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's not a large segment but you do have
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
a number of vehicles which are above 26
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
000 pounds that act just like a
 
02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle some of those larger
 
02:17:17.570 --> 02:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
Diesel Pusher motorhomes are well in
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
excess of 26 000 pounds that don't
 
02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.019 align:start position:0%
require a CDL
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
are you saying that this law won't if
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
someone had a vehicle just under 26 000
 
02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
pounds that they can't get an inspection
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
or could they still get an inspection so
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
they can go out of state
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
is it a requirement for them to get
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
inspected to go out of state they would
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
have to get an inspection but if we're
 
02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
not doing the inspection where do they
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
did you want to follow it yes please
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm saying is it's not forbidden
 
02:17:55.009 --> 02:17:55.019 align:start position:0%
for them to get an inspection so they
 
02:17:57.169 --> 02:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
could still get one couldn't they it
 
02:17:58.969 --> 02:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
depends on if other states do courtesy
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
inspections or not I'm talking about
 
02:18:02.810 --> 02:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
honesty could we do a courtesy
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
inspection it's not outlined in the
 
02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:09.349 align:start position:0%
inspection it's not outlined in the
legislation

02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought what representative
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
Sykes brought up about uh
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
paperwork posters or something like that
 
02:18:21.650 --> 02:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
to to for the public to know that they
 
02:18:25.009 --> 02:18:25.019 align:start position:0%
have a right to appeal or complain is
 
02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
that something due to fraud uh is that
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
something that you uh gentlemen would be
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
look would look into that maybe in the
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
future we could address that
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great suggestion I can
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
certainly work with Lieutenant O'Leary
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
on that and I'm sure that we could come
 
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
up with a plan
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and thank
 
02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
you for that representative Sinclair I
 
02:18:49.009 --> 02:18:49.019 align:start position:0%
do have just a couple of quick ones uh
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
actually maybe just one
 
02:18:52.730 --> 02:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
um uh we can all see the fiscal impact
 
02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
of 4.225 million dollars uh we've asked
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
to see if there's other funding in
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy uh with the Clean Air Act in
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government one last question
 
02:19:07.969 --> 02:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
on that though uh I'm not sure when our
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
contract with Gordon Darby expires but
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
what would be the fiscal impact of
 
02:19:14.209 --> 02:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
breach contract
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
it would uh we'd have to ask Gordon
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
Darby we'd have to take a look at the
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
contract and ask Gordon Darby that's a
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
that's a great question Mr chairman if
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
you could provide us with that it would
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
be great thank you sure uh any other

Transportation I'm going to reopen the
 
04:12:35.929 --> 04:12:35.939 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 260 FN
 
04:12:38.150 --> 04:12:38.160 align:start position:0%

04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
sellers for a motion
 
04:12:45.290 --> 04:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I motion to itl this bill
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir do I have a second
 
04:12:50.809 --> 04:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Hill how would you
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
basically speaking that this bill is it
 
04:12:59.090 --> 04:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill was good however
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any data given to us or any
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
statistics that would actually help us
 
04:13:07.370 --> 04:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
solve the problem and also that this
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
bill also I believe is just really a
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
one-off of being distracted there you
 
04:13:13.130 --> 04:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
could be distracted by many many
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
different things so that's why I feel
 
04:13:20.210 --> 04:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much anybody else from
 
04:13:24.530 --> 04:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.979 --> 04:13:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:30.239 --> 04:13:32.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:35.809 --> 04:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I happen to think that um
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
we do probably wish we had a lot more
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
data about this but
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things one of our Prime
 
04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
directives as members of the
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
transportation committee is to support
 
04:13:51.769 --> 04:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
Public Safety for everybody and
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
the the public safety agencies were I
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
believe unanimous in their support of
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and so for that reason I would
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.410 --> 04:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
04:14:15.530 --> 04:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against an itl motion
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
well I
 
04:14:27.170 --> 04:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh anybody else from
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
the committee it's representative Jones
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes there are a lot of
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
other safety issues that we could draw
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
but I think uh it's okay to go one at a
 
04:14:41.929 --> 04:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
time and this is a very simple thing for
 
04:14:44.689 --> 04:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh law enforcement to catch
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:14:46.080 --> 04:14:46.910 align:start position:0%
um and
um

04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:49.610 --> 04:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
in our state the number of deaths by
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle accident is way up the
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
member of pedestrian deaths is way up I
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
think we got to start taking safety
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
measures in the right direction thank
 
04:14:57.359 --> 04:14:58.610 align:start position:0%
measures in the right direction thank

04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
the bill the there's a whole paragraph
 
04:19:29.330 --> 04:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
before you but the Bold italics is the
 
04:19:31.130 --> 04:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
only change so this is the statute
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
requiring registration and plates and
 
04:19:35.689 --> 04:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
the only change is and further provided
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
that a private passenger vehicle shall
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
only be required to display one number
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
plate on the rear of the vehicle it
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't say prohibited from displaying
 
04:19:45.889 --> 04:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
two plates just that you're getting two
 
04:19:47.570 --> 04:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
plates you only got to hang one on the
 
04:19:47.580 --> 04:19:48.889 align:start position:0%
plates you only got to hang one on the
back

04:19:48.889 --> 04:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
um for this reason I think the fiscal
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
note's incorrect because it does not
 
04:19:54.530 --> 04:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
direct the department of safety to do
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything different than they do today
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
they still make two plates per vehicle
 
04:20:00.110 --> 04:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're still going to sell two plates
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
per vehicle and when you get your plates
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
you can hang one or both
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so so that ends I don't see how
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
this is something that we already do in
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just not the whole state
 
04:20:18.889 --> 04:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
at once when a town has a significant
 
04:20:21.410 --> 04:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
anniversary for its founding 150 years
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
200 250 years they are allowed for an
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
entire year to remove their front number
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
plate and replace it with a
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
commemorative plate there's usually a
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
contest for the design they're nice it's
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
a nice thing to do
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
I hear the arguments against the bill
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
but what I don't hear is data from large
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
towns where this caused any problems and
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it for quite a while
 
04:20:44.220 --> 04:20:45.309 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it for quite a while
now

04:20:45.309 --> 04:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:20:49.610 --> 04:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
further our border state Vermont went
 
04:20:51.530 --> 04:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
without front license plates for a while
 
04:20:54.170 --> 04:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
and despite for a couple years of me
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
asking I have yet to hear that any of
 
04:20:59.450 --> 04:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
the fears we had about complications to
 
04:21:02.570 --> 04:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
law enforcement manifesting over there
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
um in the absence of that
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
after specific requests I can only
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
assume at this point that that data does
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
not exist
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
and on a personal note
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
about 22 years ago when I worked for a
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
Dodge Plymouth Chrysler dealer I'd only
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
been there a couple of weeks and we got
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
on a brand new Viper
 
04:21:26.689 --> 04:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
and they told me to put the plastic
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
plate hanger bracket on the front of the
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
car and the way you do that is they give
 
04:21:33.290 --> 04:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
you a couple of lag bolts those are big
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
pointy bolts and an impact gun and you
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
literally just drive them through the
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
front fascia of the car that hurt me on
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
a deep spiritual level Mr chair
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
and also significantly devalues the car
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to try to sell it in one of
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
the 20 or so states that doesn't require
 
04:21:53.450 --> 04:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
a front plate because now you've got
 
04:21:55.130 --> 04:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
holes there and you have to keep the
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
ugly gray plastic bracket they're
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
generally not painted to match the car
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's a special request I guess or you
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
do it yourself
 
04:22:03.000 --> 04:22:04.189 align:start position:0%
do it yourself
so

04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that the fiscal
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
note's incorrect the zero fiscal impact
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
to The Spill that we've already been
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
doing this in New Hampshire as we cycle
 
04:22:15.769 --> 04:22:15.779 align:start position:0%
through our Town's anniversaries and no
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
testimony was given all the problems it
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
caused in those towns I see no reason to
 
04:22:22.849 --> 04:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
not support this bill Mr chair
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anybody else
 
04:22:28.729 --> 04:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.720 --> 04:22:35.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:22:35.450 --> 04:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:35.460 --> 04:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
again I'll go back to my comment about
 
04:22:41.570 --> 04:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
public safety and I I try to
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
pay attention to what the professional
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
Public Safety people are telling us and
 
04:22:49.610 --> 04:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who was representing the
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs of police they were
 
04:22:55.969 --> 04:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill Lieutenant
 
04:22:59.450 --> 04:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
O'Leary from the Hampshire dos was an
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
option opposition to the bill
 
04:23:02.340 --> 04:23:03.670 align:start position:0%
option opposition to the bill
um

04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
the majority of the states that only
 
04:23:06.359 --> 04:23:07.790 align:start position:0%
the majority of the states that only
require

04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
a rear license plate are states that
 
04:23:11.640 --> 04:23:13.490 align:start position:0%
a rear license plate are states that
have

04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
friendlier weather than we have up here
 
04:23:17.929 --> 04:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:23:20.110 --> 04:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that
 
04:23:23.210 --> 04:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact that I the testimony
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
that I heard was from the New Hampshire
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
D.O.T particularly the administrator of
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Turnpike Authority
 
04:23:33.050 --> 04:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
who said that this would have an adverse
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
effect on the collection of tolls
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
they collect about 13 million dollars in
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
tolls 53 percent of those were captured
 
04:23:42.910 --> 04:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
by the front plate
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
and there are in addition to that 36
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
Lanes in the toll plazas that do not
 
04:23:51.410 --> 04:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
have rear cameras so they may they may
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
not they may lose that um that Revenue
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
as well and the cost and I agree that
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
this seems a bit inflated to me but he
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
testified that the cost was four hundred
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to put rear-facing
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
cameras in the toll in the 36 locations
 
04:24:11.450 --> 04:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
that of lanes that do not have
 
04:24:11.460 --> 04:24:13.370 align:start position:0%
that of lanes that do not have
rear-facing

04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
rear-facing
 
04:24:13.380 --> 04:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
rear-facing
um

04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh cameras
 
04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
and so I think on balance
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be really careful and
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent about whenever we take
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
actions which will reduce the revenues
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
to support the the turnpikes right now
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
the turnpikes are reasonably
 
04:24:39.729 --> 04:24:39.739 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient but
 
04:24:41.809 --> 04:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that they continue
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
to be so so I would be opposed to this
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill
 
04:24:48.530 --> 04:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
 
04:24:51.170 --> 04:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sinclair thank
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I um my issues are
 
04:24:57.410 --> 04:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
the fact that manufacturers are now
 
04:24:59.150 --> 04:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
putting brand new vehicles out with no
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
front plate so maybe we're looking at
 
04:25:03.250 --> 04:25:03.260 align:start position:0%
the wave of the future here
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
with the other states that have already
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
doing this and as far as that
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
putting in cameras at the uh told toll
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
Gates that pick up the rear license
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
plate I I would have thought we already
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
have that if they're saying that 53
 
04:25:20.150 --> 04:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
percent of the money is coming been
 
04:25:21.769 --> 04:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
captured by the front plate are they
 
04:25:24.650 --> 04:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
saying that 47 is totally lost because
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's no rear uh on on the many cars
 
04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
that come into this state from states
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
that don't have that and as I mentioned
 
04:25:34.849 --> 04:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
before all the motorcycles that only
 
04:25:37.729 --> 04:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
have one rear plate so has the state
 
04:25:40.370 --> 04:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
just are they just saying no we're not
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to worry about that if they need
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
those cameras they should already have
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
them there and I would agree with
 
04:25:47.210 --> 04:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes that the price
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
seems a little a little inflated to me
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
on that so I I will be supporting this
 
04:25:55.010 --> 04:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
for those reasons thank you
 
04:25:58.490 --> 04:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.500 --> 04:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
see

04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative Jones
 
04:26:04.010 --> 04:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I think as far as
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement it cuts this would
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
cut their ability to ID a car they need
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
to die they need to uh ID by 50 because
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
now they can only see it from the back
 
04:26:18.370 --> 04:26:18.380 align:start position:0%
if they're coming forward
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward oncoming they can't idea
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
a car they may be looking for or a car
 
04:26:28.429 --> 04:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's uh been involved in in something
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
um also um I had an experience
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
at my house uh where we had porch
 
04:26:38.809 --> 04:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
Pirates and I have a ring system on my
 
04:26:38.819 --> 04:26:39.950 align:start position:0%
Pirates and I have a ring system on my
doorbell

04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
doorbell
 
04:26:39.960 --> 04:26:41.090 align:start position:0%
doorbell
but

04:26:41.090 --> 04:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they pulled in forward
 
04:26:46.849 --> 04:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
took the boxes off my porch and backed
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
right out and didn't have a front
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
license plate so the police were not
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
able to ID the vehicle so I think it's
 
04:26:55.849 --> 04:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
just a matter of more security by having
 
04:26:58.010 --> 04:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
two more plates having two plates thank
 
04:26:59.090 --> 04:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
fair enough anybody else from the
 
04:27:00.840 --> 04:27:02.750 align:start position:0%
fair enough anybody else from the
committee

04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:27:04.849 --> 04:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes one more stab at it
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take my second bite at the
 
04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
Apple thank you Mr chairman
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think I didn't make enough
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the point that
 
04:27:16.429 --> 04:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
having a front plate which again is more
 
04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to identify the vehicle that
 
04:27:21.769 --> 04:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
may be involved in a crime and by the
 
04:27:24.410 --> 04:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
way vehicles are frequently
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
involved in crime we don't want to take
 
04:27:31.250 --> 04:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
that tool away we just don't want to
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
take that tool away and
 
04:27:33.720 --> 04:27:35.090 align:start position:0%
take that tool away and
um

04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:35.100 --> 04:27:36.590 align:start position:0%
um
we

04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
can give we're given examples of how
 
04:27:44.090 --> 04:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
crimes were solved because there was a
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
front plate even though that front plate
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
even though no police officer happened
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
to actually see the crime take place it
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
happened they were able to identify the
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle based on the evidence left
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
behind by the front plate specifically a
 
04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
crash into a more into a home and the
 
04:28:04.490 --> 04:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
impression of the numbers of the license
 
04:28:08.210 --> 04:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
plate the front license plate were left
 
04:28:11.689 --> 04:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
on the side of the building and that led
 
04:28:14.570 --> 04:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
to solving the crime so
 
04:28:17.570 --> 04:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
I I just can't imagine
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't leave important tools
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
both Financial tools and public safety
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
tools in the hands of the agencies that
 
04:28:31.849 --> 04:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
need them the amount of
 
04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have while we may not have some data
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we want we also don't have
 
04:28:38.040 --> 04:28:39.469 align:start position:0%
that we want we also don't have
um

04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
how many people how many people are
 
04:28:44.090 --> 04:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
actually complaining about this
 
04:28:46.729 --> 04:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
I mean I know there's a very vocal
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh group of people who complain about
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
having having to have the first the
 
04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
front and the back plate but we've heard
 
04:28:55.610 --> 04:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
no data that said well yeah there's two
 
04:28:57.290 --> 04:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
percent of the drivers
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
do we make Law changes based on such
 
04:29:06.170 --> 04:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's all
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
speculation just like it's speculation
 
04:29:12.170 --> 04:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
that these do help we've been asking for
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
the data for years and still we don't
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
have it anybody else from the committee
 
04:29:17.279 --> 04:29:20.210 align:start position:0%
have it anybody else from the committee
representative

04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:22.250 --> 04:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the only thing I
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
consider that Beyond and what other
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
people have said is
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that a lot of people in New
 
04:29:29.570 --> 04:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tow trailers and that can
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
obscure the rear plate no matter whether
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
you have a rear-facing cameras or not
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
and you lose the revenue not only from
 
04:29:36.889 --> 04:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
the vehicle but from the trailer from
 
04:29:40.010 --> 04:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
the extra axle for axles so to me that's
 
04:29:41.330 --> 04:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
that's one of the arguments that wasn't
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.210 --> 04:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
fair enough anybody else
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
yeah Representatives Blaine
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
well just to point out that a lot of
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
people in the state also drive with
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
plows on the truck
 
04:29:57.410 --> 04:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
totally obscuring the front plate and
 
04:29:59.330 --> 04:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
making it meaningless for a good portion
 
04:30:02.210 --> 04:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
of the year I'm one of them so uh if I
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
was to tow a trailer and have a plow I
 
04:30:08.269 --> 04:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else representative
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
sellers I didn't know this was going to
 
04:30:15.050 --> 04:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
be such a thank you Mr chair
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
as I've heard you say earlier uh
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative Smith say that we're
 
04:30:21.050 --> 04:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
still handing out two plates if they
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
want to put on a second plate they can
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else I gave representative Sykes
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
a second bait you can have one too as
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair I would just
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
like to comment that the vast majority
 
04:30:38.689 --> 04:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
of trailers on the road have a license
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
plate on them uh up the vast majority
 
04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
not all of them uh which if somebody's
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
got a picture of it they can probably
 
04:30:54.729 --> 04:30:54.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead I would just point out as as I
 
04:31:02.269 --> 04:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
believe the testimony we heard was that
 
04:31:02.279 --> 04:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
believe the testimony we heard was that
um

04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
under the current rsas
 
04:31:08.689 --> 04:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
persons trailer plates are not used to
 
04:31:10.809 --> 04:31:10.819 align:start position:0%
assign financial
 
04:31:13.490 --> 04:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility only plates on the the
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%

um well quite frankly with this this
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
particular Bill starts getting into the
 
04:40:32.050 --> 04:40:32.060 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle part of the law
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
and when that starts getting into that
 
04:40:36.850 --> 04:40:36.860 align:start position:0%
we're now getting into the the federal
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
law which
 
04:40:43.730 --> 04:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
can cause some issues in regards to this
 
04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and uh quite frankly uh
 
04:40:50.208 --> 04:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
388 was a simpler Bill we couldn't pass
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
this one so I'm not sure if this one
 
04:40:54.890 --> 04:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
would Pass the Mustard either
 
04:40:56.810 --> 04:40:56.820 align:start position:0%

representative Sinclair
 
04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
I my problem with this and I didn't
 
04:41:04.970 --> 04:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
realize is until he had the testimony
 
04:41:08.930 --> 04:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
was that Vehicles 10 000 pounds to
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
twenty six thousand pounds uh would be
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
exempt from that uh having that front
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
plate and I uh well I guess that was on
 
04:41:19.368 --> 04:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
the inspection but I I agree that uh
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
commercial plate Vehicles should have a
 
04:41:24.890 --> 04:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
front plate for obvious reasons
 
04:41:29.448 --> 04:41:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh I have to agree with Vice chair
 
04:41:33.410 --> 04:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
Gorski let's be honest we can save a
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of time 388 was the simpler of the
 
04:41:38.090 --> 04:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
two and it failed uh this one's not
 
04:41:39.410 --> 04:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
going anywhere
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill 393.
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to reset we'll be taking
 
04:43:15.780 --> 04:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to reset we'll be taking
up

04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:44:49.010 --> 04:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the executive
 
04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 597 FN relative to
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
racing ethnicity data on driver's
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
licenses and race and ethnicity data
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
collection Jay recognizes representative
 
04:45:04.490 --> 04:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
sellers for a motion
 
04:45:07.010 --> 04:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
and give us the chair I motion to itl
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:45:15.010 --> 04:45:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Smith
 
04:45:20.810 --> 04:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh would you care to speak to motion
 
04:45:22.490 --> 04:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes I would thank you
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
so so this bill I was looking at it here
 
04:45:26.040 --> 04:45:27.288 align:start position:0%
so so this bill I was looking at it here
um

04:45:27.288 --> 04:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
excuse me I just lost it in my apologies
 
04:45:30.890 --> 04:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
I might even just close the whole tab
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
but anyways I believe it's uh it's under
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
RSA 260 14a that it's changing and
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
adding to and it's it's collecting
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
statistical data but the data that it's
 
04:45:45.650 --> 04:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
collecting is not all inclusive because
 
04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
you the driver has uh whoever's applying
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the license has the option of
 
04:45:53.930 --> 04:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
of providing that option material of
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and also race so therefore
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
your data automatically is going to be
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
skewed it won't have all the data that
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
should have it will only have a partial
 
04:46:07.570 --> 04:46:07.580 align:start position:0%
data set and therefore trying to
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
really get good statistics out of it
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
you're just not going to get it
 
04:46:14.448 --> 04:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
 
04:46:14.458 --> 04:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
committee

04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair I hear what
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
you're saying are representative but the
 
04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
testimony we had from Public Safety
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
officials amongst others was that this
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
was they agreed about that but this was
 
04:46:32.690 --> 04:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
a start and at this point any uh
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
information is better than no
 
04:46:34.080 --> 04:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
information is better than no
information

04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:46:39.170 --> 04:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's what I took from it
 
04:46:44.930 --> 04:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.940 --> 04:46:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
during testimony for this bill I think
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
it was there was broad support for
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
passage of it and I just would tell a
 
04:46:55.368 --> 04:46:55.378 align:start position:0%
personal story that the first time I
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
heard about this not this specific bill
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
but the the concept of collecting
 
04:47:04.368 --> 04:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic data
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
through whatever means my immediate
 
04:47:09.410 --> 04:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
reaction was no we don't want to do that
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
but then when we heard testimony and it
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
was further explained to me why this is
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
an important
 
04:47:18.410 --> 04:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
04:47:18.420 --> 04:47:19.010 align:start position:0%
thing to do
um

04:47:19.010 --> 04:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:20.810 --> 04:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
I changed my mind
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
it was a good thing to do and we heard
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
from a variety of different
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
organizations we heard from the all of
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
whom were in support of this bill we
 
04:47:33.610 --> 04:47:33.620 align:start position:0%
heard from the ACLU the police Chiefs
 
04:47:36.530 --> 04:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
specifically police chief from Hollis
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
and also retired police chief from Dover
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
we heard from the NAACP we heard from
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Justice
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
we heard from the New Hampshire State
 
04:47:46.200 --> 04:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
we heard from the New Hampshire State
Police

04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
Police
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
they all make the point they all made
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
the essential point that this will be a
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
police response and that the current
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
Tools in our Tool Shed are inadequate
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'll use as an example
 
04:48:09.650 --> 04:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
my community the city of Lebanon is one
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the few departments in the state that
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
is Coleus certified
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
but in speaking to my police chief about
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and what the efforts that they
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
make to collect racial and ethnic data
 
04:48:23.570 --> 04:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
he acknowledged that it was an
 
04:48:26.448 --> 04:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
incomplete tool in the Khalia toolbox
 
04:48:28.368 --> 04:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
and that it would be
 
04:48:30.830 --> 04:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
and so if it's an incomplete tool and we
 
04:48:33.890 --> 04:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
have a way to add further data
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
and again we should be making database
 
04:48:36.240 --> 04:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
and again we should be making database
decisions

04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any data now how can it
 
04:48:44.690 --> 04:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
be a bad thing to get additional data
 
04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I'm fully in support
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
of this having changed my mind about how
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
it might work because
 
04:48:55.368 --> 04:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
the the things that will happen would be
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
it could do it could go both ways
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
this data once collected could show that
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
a police department
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
is doing a great job their ethnic
 
04:49:09.770 --> 04:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
population may be two percent
 
04:49:11.570 --> 04:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
04:49:13.610 --> 04:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
two percent stops
 
04:49:15.650 --> 04:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
for that ethnic group
 
04:49:18.530 --> 04:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
great sounds like they're doing a re a
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
really good job of of
 
04:49:24.430 --> 04:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
bare unbiased police work
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
community-based police work which is
 
04:49:28.490 --> 04:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:49:31.970 --> 04:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
however it could also be that the ethnic
 
04:49:34.250 --> 04:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
population in my city for instance is
 
04:49:37.368 --> 04:49:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.730 --> 04:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
what if we were stopping 25 percent
 
04:49:44.090 --> 04:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
of this what if 25 of the stops were
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
people from an ethnic with a different
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
ethnicity than the remainder
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
that says
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
my police chief I know what he would do
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
he'd say I've got to work on this we've
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
got to do better
 
04:49:59.208 --> 04:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
how do you get that tool if you don't
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
start collecting the data I urge my
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the transportation
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
committee to allow the collection of
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
data that will improve policing in
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
general improve community policing
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
specifically and would help those
 
04:50:17.330 --> 04:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
departments that are on the road to
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
improving and doing a better job for the
 
04:50:23.170 --> 04:50:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.070 --> 04:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
04:50:26.810 --> 04:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm having a hard
 
04:50:32.810 --> 04:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
time determining or or understanding how
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
you would be able to determine that 11
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
of your stops
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
were in one category when you don't have
 
04:50:47.470 --> 04:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
the complete set of data to show what 11
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
consists of
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't you can't
 
04:50:57.170 --> 04:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
you can't always blanket say that some
 
04:51:00.530 --> 04:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
data is better than no data in this case
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's not if you have inaccurate or
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
incomplete data then you're painting an
 
04:51:08.878 --> 04:51:10.368 align:start position:0%
incomplete data then you're painting an
incorrect

04:51:10.368 --> 04:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
04:51:12.730 --> 04:51:12.740 align:start position:0%
picture when you try to
 
04:51:16.850 --> 04:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
assess that data that's that's why I
 
04:51:18.250 --> 04:51:18.260 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:51:23.330 --> 04:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.610 --> 04:51:24.620 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative of you
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
one of our biggest complaints on the
 
04:51:30.890 --> 04:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
committee is the lack of data we've
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually killed a bill today because we
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have any data that supported it
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to start the process of
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
collecting data it's not perfect because
 
04:51:43.690 --> 04:51:43.700 align:start position:0%
opt-in data is not going to be perfect
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
but right now the the only data we have
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
is data that's reported by the police
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
and we've already had a testimony that
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
said that sometimes they're misreporting
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
and we don't know why
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
so if that's a trend if if there's
 
04:52:02.270 --> 04:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
habitual misreporting of race or
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
perceived race in a stop we can't
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
compare that to any other information
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
because we don't have it so this bill
 
04:52:10.730 --> 04:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
just simply starts the process of
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
collecting the data and how it's used in
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
the future will be up to each individual
 
04:52:16.250 --> 04:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
individual Department as they report to
 
04:52:18.650 --> 04:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
the state and of course it's going to be
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
the people who know how to use the data
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
are going to understand that it's not
 
04:52:27.770 --> 04:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee I'll
 
04:52:31.970 --> 04:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
go back and forth representative Gorski
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair well my concern with
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
the bill is you know we had the police
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
Chiefs here and especially the police
 
04:52:40.850 --> 04:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
chief of Hollis and you know one of the
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
questions that I asked was how often
 
04:52:44.810 --> 04:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
would you look at this data and he said
 
04:52:44.820 --> 04:52:45.770 align:start position:0%
would you look at this data and he said
yearly

04:52:45.770 --> 04:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
now if this data is so important why are
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
we only looking at it for one year if
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this data I would
 
04:52:54.650 --> 04:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
think you want to look at it on a
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
consistent basis so it doesn't seem like
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
there is a consistent process here in
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
terms of analyzing the data and that's
 
04:53:02.570 --> 04:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
the kind of the issue I have with the
 
04:53:02.580 --> 04:53:05.050 align:start position:0%
the kind of the issue I have with the
bill

04:53:05.050 --> 04:53:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
representative Rumbo
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
um we are a testimony on this bill or
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
during the hearing that
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
um it puts officers in a difficult
 
04:53:16.250 --> 04:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
position that they shouldn't need to be
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
inquiring of individuals that they
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
stopped about their race or ethnicity
 
04:53:22.850 --> 04:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and but that they may need to
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
identify that information in their
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
reports and that there's not always
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
accurate information recorded
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily knowing why but to the
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
extent that we may not all be able to
 
04:53:34.030 --> 04:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
make that assessment
 
04:53:36.550 --> 04:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
in an interaction with an individual
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
accurately assess their race or
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
ethnicity I think this is a tool that
 
04:53:43.010 --> 04:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
also provides our officers more
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
information for when they're filling out
 
04:53:45.890 --> 04:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
the report so that they are not having
 
04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
to make a judgment call on their own
 
04:53:49.610 --> 04:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
whether that's on the idea whether it's
 
04:53:52.610 --> 04:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
listed as a code asks rather in artfully
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
during the hearing but it would be a
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
code or if it would be listed by you
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
know color ethnicity
 
04:54:01.128 --> 04:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a tool not only for
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
data but also for law enforcement to for
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative Smith
 
04:54:14.208 --> 04:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:17.208 --> 04:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
um so my view of this is based on my
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
four years as a database quality analyst
 
04:54:21.890 --> 04:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
for a tech company the only thing this
 
04:54:23.930 --> 04:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
actually gives you the only data it
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
provides is the total number of people
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
of a given race or ethnicity who are
 
04:54:31.250 --> 04:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
willing to self-report it's not even a
 
04:54:32.330 --> 04:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
percentage because we don't have
 
04:54:34.690 --> 04:54:34.700 align:start position:0%
accurate numbers on what the total
 
04:54:37.368 --> 04:54:37.378 align:start position:0%
potential pool is
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
my fear is that if anybody if we did
 
04:54:42.288 --> 04:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
this and anybody looked at it they might
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
make a decision based on it and that
 
04:54:45.310 --> 04:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
would be dangerous let's say
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetically that African Americans
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
are twice as likely to self-report as
 
04:54:52.490 --> 04:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hispanics when you're talking to low
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
numbers that we have in this state that
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
could easily show it's completely
 
04:54:58.910 --> 04:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect result when you look at the
 
04:54:58.920 --> 04:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
incorrect result when you look at the
totals

04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
totals
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
so what action would they take based on
 
04:55:04.970 --> 04:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
that if it's just
 
04:55:04.980 --> 04:55:06.530 align:start position:0%
that if it's just
all

04:55:06.530 --> 04:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
non-white races or ethnicities in
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
general you don't need this level of
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
granularity because the state is
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
literally not going to prove anything
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
and potentially produce a flawed result
 
04:55:19.368 --> 04:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
now the part that really winds my crack
 
04:55:23.448 --> 04:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
though is ethnicity it isn't defined I
 
04:55:25.310 --> 04:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what it means here's an
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
example my mother
 
04:55:29.810 --> 04:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
her parents were born in Cuba and
 
04:55:29.820 --> 04:55:31.070 align:start position:0%
her parents were born in Cuba and
Germany

04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
Germany
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
what box does she check what's her
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is it which culture she feels
 
04:55:37.730 --> 04:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
and which doesn't particularly feel like
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
either one and she's just herself
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know what ethnicity proves I
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly support the bill with
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
such a subjective term in it if you're
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
looking for data-driven results I don't
 
04:55:51.530 --> 04:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
think there is one for this I am
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
Cuban German Norwegian and Austrian what
 
04:55:58.368 --> 04:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
am I besides a fascist to enjoys skiing
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
and my whole family hasn't won a war in
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
100 years I mean I don't know of what
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
value that is to anybody
 
04:56:08.448 --> 04:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
I know someone who their parents are
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
Chinese and Indian which boxes do they
 
04:56:14.570 --> 04:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
check and how uncomfortable is the
 
04:56:16.368 --> 04:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
conversation that you have to have to
 
04:56:18.670 --> 04:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
explain it I don't want any part of it
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
this doesn't produce any data that can
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
be actually used for anything it makes
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
people feel awkward and I can't support
 
04:56:25.440 --> 04:56:29.350 align:start position:0%
people feel awkward and I can't support
it

04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:33.050 --> 04:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
any representative Sykes
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things that I forgot to
 
04:56:39.010 --> 04:56:39.020 align:start position:0%
mention one a lot of data is available
 
04:56:42.170 --> 04:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
partly it's called the U.S census and
 
04:56:44.510 --> 04:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
they break down ethnicity
 
04:56:47.330 --> 04:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
into a bunch of different things and so
 
04:56:49.850 --> 04:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
we have beginning points I didn't pull
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
11 of the population of my city
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
from thin air because I could I got it
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.770 --> 04:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
we do not want to make subjective
 
04:57:10.730 --> 04:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
choices about our ethnicity and in fact
 
04:57:13.368 --> 04:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
because it is an opt-in program and it
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
gives the person the opportunity to
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
what they are it might help solve
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's problem about
 
04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.718 --> 04:57:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually surprised that we're
 
04:57:33.890 --> 04:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
debating this to this point I thought
 
04:57:35.810 --> 04:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
this was a much simpler Bill I'm glad
 
04:57:37.490 --> 04:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
you did bring up the U.S census because
 
04:57:39.650 --> 04:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
when it asks for ethnicity it's also
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
optional it's optional because it's
 
04:57:43.550 --> 04:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
against federal law to require that
 
04:57:46.250 --> 04:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
information that's why it's also an
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
option in if House Bill 597 and and I
 
04:57:51.770 --> 04:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
agree with the people supporting this
 
04:57:54.110 --> 04:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
motion I've been here for 10 years and I
 
04:57:55.850 --> 04:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you how many times I have
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
heard in committee rooms show me the
 
04:58:00.650 --> 04:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
data show me the data show me the data
 
04:58:03.970 --> 04:58:03.980 align:start position:0%
well in this case we're going to have
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
incomplete data with it being optional
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that you cannot call
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
it reliable I don't know what purpose it
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
serves and I will also be supporting the
 
04:58:14.340 --> 04:58:15.650 align:start position:0%
serves and I will also be supporting the
itl

04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt Schultz but
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay Schultz sorry you know we
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
are all German in that sense
 
04:58:30.410 --> 04:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
um we being Schmitz and Schultz's anyway
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I haven't
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
never needed to mention this in any
 
04:58:36.288 --> 04:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
committee before so I hope it's of some
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
value but
 
04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
um as someone who
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh has multiple graduate level
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
statistics statistics classes in
 
04:58:45.360 --> 04:58:46.850 align:start position:0%
statistics statistics classes in
criminology

04:58:46.850 --> 04:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
criminology
 
04:58:48.530 --> 04:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
I can say
 
04:58:51.770 --> 04:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
it is often true that the data is
 
04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
incomplete and yet it is sufficient
 
04:58:54.540 --> 04:58:55.610 align:start position:0%
incomplete and yet it is sufficient
enough

04:58:55.610 --> 04:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
to make decisions that saves money
 
04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
improves laws
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
um helps police officers helps people
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
who train police officers and that's
 
04:59:09.650 --> 04:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at
 
04:59:12.410 --> 04:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I think I hope these are all really
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons why people feel the way they
 
04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
do about this bill I think regardless of
 
04:59:21.530 --> 04:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
what the data shows it will be helpful
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sure our police officers are
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic and we should be able to help
 
04:59:29.150 --> 04:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
equip police officers and those who
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
train police officers
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge of how things
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
actually are panning out
 
04:59:37.010 --> 04:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's all this is
 
04:59:39.410 --> 04:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
allows people to make decisions based on
 
04:59:41.448 --> 04:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
it it's really not more complicated than
 
04:59:41.458 --> 04:59:43.970 align:start position:0%
it it's really not more complicated than
that

04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I will reiterate I think no
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
data is better than incorrect or
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
incomplete data I'm going to ask the
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%

pass fails 10 10.
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh with no amendments I think it's
 
05:03:22.610 --> 05:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
simple enough looks like this will be
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
moving to the floor without
 
05:03:23.580 --> 05:03:25.250 align:start position:0%
moving to the floor without
recommendation

05:03:25.250 --> 05:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:03:28.128 --> 05:03:28.138 align:start position:0%
so um do we have any volunteers for
 
05:03:28.138 --> 05:03:29.690 align:start position:0%
so um do we have any volunteers for
positions

05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
we'll sort that out afterwards I'm going
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
to close the executive session on House
 
05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:20.990 --> 05:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna open up the executive
 
05:06:24.650 --> 05:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 646 eliminating
 
05:06:26.770 --> 05:06:26.780 align:start position:0%
the vehicle inspection mandate for
 
05:06:29.810 --> 05:06:29.820 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion
 
05:06:54.890 --> 05:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman besides the idea um
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
basically that it's unsafe for vehicles
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
to be on the road that aren't inspected
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh annually the
 
05:07:02.638 --> 05:07:03.890 align:start position:0%
uh annually the
um I'm

05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
kind of astounded by the revenue loss
 
05:07:09.770 --> 05:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the state about 4 million 225
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
000 and
 
05:07:14.930 --> 05:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the revenue lost to local
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
um municipalities of about five hundred
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
and seven thousand dollars so uh put
 
05:07:24.890 --> 05:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
those all together I feel an Ito isn't
 
05:07:24.900 --> 05:07:28.430 align:start position:0%
those all together I feel an Ito isn't
order

05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:07:34.490 --> 05:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:36.770 --> 05:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
first of all Mr chair I wish we weren't
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
voting on this today since we just heard
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
it today it's the one we just heard
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
today correct
 
05:07:44.330 --> 05:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
I I would have liked to have a week to
 
05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
check on some of these figures
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
especially uh the the financial thing
 
05:07:51.550 --> 05:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
about cities losing money on this
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
because in all my life going to City
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
Council meetings and and listening to
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
budget reports I have never once heard
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
the City of Laconia refer to money taken
 
05:08:04.490 --> 05:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
in by inspections it's always been
 
05:08:04.500 --> 05:08:05.890 align:start position:0%
in by inspections it's always been
registrations

05:08:05.890 --> 05:08:05.900 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
05:08:09.288 --> 05:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
not inspections and I'm just not sure
 
05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
where that's coming from and now I'm not
 
05:08:12.410 --> 05:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
going to have the chance to figure that
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
one out so
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I and I know the comment was just
 
05:08:20.570 --> 05:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
made about the safety of uh our highways
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
but again we have so many vehicles that
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
come into this state year round from
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
states that don't require it and I've
 
05:08:29.330 --> 05:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
here we go with the information or data
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
I've never seen any information that
 
05:08:34.010 --> 05:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
we've had all these accidents in this
 
05:08:36.170 --> 05:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
state caused by vehicles that come from
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
states with no inspection uh required
 
05:08:40.610 --> 05:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm not talking about air emissions
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about inspections thank you
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
represent sellers thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:51.650 --> 05:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know when it comes to inspections we
 
05:08:54.050 --> 05:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
know in essence they're absolutely good
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
but they're only good for that one
 
05:08:57.530 --> 05:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
moment in time as soon as you
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
drive off the out the door of the garage
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's something could
 
05:09:01.500 --> 05:09:02.330 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's something could
happen

05:09:02.330 --> 05:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
but the other problem is I have is that
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're not allowing people to have and
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
take their own responsibility and this
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
is a responsibility of the person that
 
05:09:14.930 --> 05:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
owns the vehicle and I think that as
 
05:09:17.448 --> 05:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens we should have
 
05:09:19.010 --> 05:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
the freedom to have our personal
 
05:09:21.890 --> 05:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility and be able to say our
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
car is safe or not or to drive it or not
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
with or without an inspection sticker
 
05:09:31.490 --> 05:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.208 --> 05:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.218 --> 05:09:36.650 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:09:36.650 --> 05:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
well with nobody else I'll mention a
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
um in terms of looking into anything on
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note this bill was introduced
 
05:09:45.470 --> 05:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
in transportation six weeks ago I'm
 
05:09:46.970 --> 05:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
waiting for the hearing just to answer
 
05:09:48.890 --> 05:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
questions like data in print isn't
 
05:09:48.900 --> 05:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
questions like data in print isn't
necessary

05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I've seen in my 10
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
years I cannot tell you how many bills
 
05:09:58.090 --> 05:09:58.100 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the inspection program
 
05:09:59.930 --> 05:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some things have not
 
05:10:02.570 --> 05:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
changed the fiscal note hasn't changed
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's always been an issue violating
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
the Gordon Derby contract and that
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
financial burden will be an issue
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
um what else did I have jotted down
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
potential Highway funds that are at risk
 
05:10:18.010 --> 05:10:18.020 align:start position:0%
uh if we get rid of this uh at this time
 
05:10:21.410 --> 05:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh but this bill in particular
 
05:10:23.330 --> 05:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
because it has an overlay but the
 
05:10:25.368 --> 05:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's licenses and that's
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the major change that starts all this it
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
can be done a lot of different ways this
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
one to me makes it a uh exceptionally
 
05:10:35.570 --> 05:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
more difficult to uh to look at only
 
05:10:37.330 --> 05:10:37.340 align:start position:0%
because now when we start going into
 
05:10:40.250 --> 05:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier laws that are governed by
 
05:10:41.930 --> 05:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
the federal government we're going down
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
a slippery slope for all those Reasons
 
05:10:48.530 --> 05:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
um without with the I'm sorry doesn't it
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
say here it's me I I'm sorry I thought
 
05:10:55.970 --> 05:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
you agree I just you know what I mean no
 
05:10:57.288 --> 05:10:57.298 align:start position:0%
fairness I did look at you go ahead
 
05:10:58.850 --> 05:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
represent Sinclair
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't it say for non-commercial
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
Vehicles right there in the bill an act
 
05:11:05.448 --> 05:11:05.458 align:start position:0%
eliminating the vehicle inspection
 
05:11:11.770 --> 05:11:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:14.090 --> 05:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of commercial
 
05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles from 10 000 to 26 000 pounds
 
05:11:19.490 --> 05:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
that you don't need a commercial license
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
for that are treated commercially those
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
do fall underneath federal law you need
 
05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
you don't need a commercial license for
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
it but because of the gross vehicle
 
05:11:29.930 --> 05:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
weight of those they are governed you
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
need a medical card if they're being
 
05:11:32.570 --> 05:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
used commercially
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's all part of the um
 
05:11:36.770 --> 05:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just drawing a blame but they do
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
have Federal overlays as we just heard
 
05:11:41.810 --> 05:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
in the testimony today
 
05:11:43.730 --> 05:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
that that's what makes it challenging
 
05:11:45.650 --> 05:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
for me on this one I've seen different
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
attempts that didn't bring in the
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I I agree with you on this
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and my question would be it and
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
if this if it's probably too late now
 
05:12:00.288 --> 05:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
again because we're voting on this now
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
but had this committed with an amendment
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
to change that part of it to eliminate
 
05:12:08.690 --> 05:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
that 10 000 and above from being exempt
 
05:12:10.190 --> 05:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
from an inspection is that are you
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
saying that that's something you would
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
have supported I'm not I don't know if I
 
05:12:15.288 --> 05:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
would have supported or not but that's
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
the reason I don't think this bill will
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
work I didn't know that I did somebody
 
05:12:20.448 --> 05:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
mention there was an amendment floating
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
on but I did not see it
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
um if we think we want to see the
 
05:12:26.090 --> 05:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
amendment at this point with the motion
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's on the floor unfortunately we're
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
going to have to defeat this motion uh
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
to go any further is there an amendment
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
so I I did have an amendment drafted up
 
05:12:39.650 --> 05:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
um for uh you know my thought was making
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
it biannual and um I did kind of in the
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
financial note it talked about the
 
05:12:46.010 --> 05:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles over ten thousand
 
05:12:48.770 --> 05:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
pounds so basically my Amendment would
 
05:12:50.690 --> 05:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
kind of fix that so that those Vehicles
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
would still be covered under the
 
05:12:51.840 --> 05:12:53.330 align:start position:0%
would still be covered under the
inspections

05:12:53.330 --> 05:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
um so the the what I'm kind of hearing
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
is that you know where the admissions
 
05:13:00.650 --> 05:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
part is kind of the sticking point for
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the one year so I'd like more I mean I I
 
05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a way we could
 
05:13:06.170 --> 05:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
retain this or maybe more time to look
 
05:13:07.610 --> 05:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a huge you know I don't want
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
to get rid of inspections altogether but
 
05:13:11.218 --> 05:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
to get rid of inspections altogether but
I

05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:13:13.850 --> 05:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know I would like to look into this
 
05:13:15.770 --> 05:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that works
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
fair enough but unfortunately the way it
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
works were we we do have a motion on the
 
05:13:25.490 --> 05:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
floor that has been second and so if the
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee believes that we either want
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
to make another motion to retain or
 
05:13:31.610 --> 05:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
other then we'll have to defeat the one
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's here
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
um that's just that's where we're at and
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
so anybody else wish to speak on the itl
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see anybody else to speak
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the Ito with that being said I'll ask
 
05:13:50.930 --> 05:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the roll uh as soon as
 
05:13:54.650 --> 05:13:54.660 align:start position:0%

seems to be some Merit in this and looks
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
like there's still some things that can
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
be worked out on this bill
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%

judiciary might be able to help us a
 
05:19:09.530 --> 05:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
little bit here so I think it might be a
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
good idea to retain it to see if we can
 
05:19:13.850 --> 05:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
