to be here um I'm going to take just a
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
moment to share my screen so you can see
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh what we'll be talking through and
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
again this is the same document was
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
provided to the LBA I believe was also
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you so bear with me
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay are you able to see that yes yes
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
PDF of our presentation okay
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
perfect so as I said we're happy to be
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
here today we'll be going through the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
larger uh Dr taxes um and Madam chair if
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
it works for you I might suggest that we
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
stop at the end of each tax and take any
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
questions relevant to that tax before we
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
proceed to the next um just because
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see that our conversation will be
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
very different depending on the taxes
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about this morning
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you that sounds good okay
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
great um so our estimates were
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
calculated um based on FAL year 21 plan
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
um based on currently available data is
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
data either through October or November
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
depending on the tax type and we made
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
our um plan amount or our the plan
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
amounts based on the expectation and
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
results that revenues um have been
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by the covid pandemic over the
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
past few months um we gave consideration
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
different payment types that we've
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
received with in a tax type the tax
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
periods for which we are receiving
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
revenue and how the payments May again
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
be affected by
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
covid Lindsay I'm I'm sorry to interrupt
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
could could you could you bump up the
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion there you go that's beautiful
 
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
suggestion there you go that's beautiful
thank

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
you uh part of it's there thank you was
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
off screen can everybody mute because I
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
keep hearing this scratchiness and I
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes the last thing I'll not before I
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
begin um is that these estimates are
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
subject to change uh as you may remember
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
back in may we presented um fiscal year
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
21 Revenue estimates and you'll see
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
today that our estimates have changed
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
significantly um since that time so uh
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
no promises about what the future will
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
hold we're doing our best to provide
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
accurate estimates but obviously as we
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
discussed last time there's no road map
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
for uh how this pandemic will impact
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
revenues and so we're constantly taking
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
in additional information reviewing the
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
r that we have received to date and
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
updating our projections appropriately I
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
will note um that I was attending a
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
regional tax administrators conference
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
um last week or the week before and
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
spoke with Commissioners for the other
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
New England and Northeast northeast
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
states and many mentioned the same
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
sediment when they originally did their
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
revenue projections they were projecting
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
significant shortfalls um and revenues
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
to date have been um surprising in that
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
they're performing better than was which
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
what we originally expected so we're not
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
alone in this boat um trying to figure
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
out where revenues are headed um but I
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
hope that you will take the time to
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
understand what we've what we talked
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
through today and obviously provide us
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
with any feedback if there's other
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
things that you'd like us to
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider okay moving forward the first
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to talk about just to
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
kind of set the stage is the fiscal 2020
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable which is a total of
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
30. 8 million I wanted to make sure
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
everyone understood kind of what
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
produced this or why we have an
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable and then what
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
produced it so as part of the state's
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
year-end financial reporting which um
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
the state produces the comprehensive
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
annual financial report or the caffer
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
which is our um audited financial
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
statements revenues that are received um
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
are converted from a cash basis to an
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
cruel basis and what that means is we
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
look at the revenues that we received
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
during the first 60 days of the new
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so in our case July and
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
August we look at July and August
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
revenues and we determine how much of
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
those revenues that we' received really
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
are attributable to underlying activity
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
in the prior fiscal
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
year so an easy example for this would
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
be uh business taxes uh business tax
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
payers provide quarterly estim estimated
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
payments if we received an estimated
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
payment in July that's really for
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
underlying activity that occurred in
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
June April May and June of the prior
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
year which is the prior fiscal year so
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
we would take that estimate and we would
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
pull it back to the prior
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
year we do this every year the amounts
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
are typically pretty consistent so they
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
have a pretty minimal impact when you
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
look from a cash to an acral basis
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
however in 2020 obviously things need to
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
be different um so what happened in 2020
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
um it was most significant in business
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
taxes and in the interest in dividends
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
tax as you may remember the federal
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
government extended the due dates from
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
April 15th to July
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
15th here in New Hampshire we extended
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
our due dates from April 15 to June 15th
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons for doing that
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
was to keep all of the revenue within
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
the same fiscal year however we did have
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
a number of taxpayers that still
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
followed the July 15th date so we
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
received a fair amount of Revenue for
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
business taxes and interest in dividends
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
tax in
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
July uh which is a large contributor to
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
the 30.8 million of anomalous receivable
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
um obviously that is an anomaly that
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
does not happen every year um and it was
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
not what we anticipated because as I
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
said our our date was um moved forward
 
00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:23.389 align:start position:0%
said our our date was um moved forward
to

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
june5 we have some small other anomalous
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
receivables and these are really just
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
due to timing issues uh we needed to
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
provide estimates to the Department of
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services in July before
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
July 15th and so we didn't have all of
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
the revenues in so our estimates were
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
slightly off from where the actuals came
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
in but again really the majority is due
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
to many taxpayers following the July
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
15th date this produced the anomalous
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
receivable so this these amounts will
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
show in the fiscal year 2020
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
cafer for revenues they are also showing
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 Cash basis revenues
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
because when we look at a cash basis we
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
reflect the amounts that we receive at
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
any given time so we have done our
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
estimates including the anomalous
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
receivables in fiscal year 21 because
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
that'll be consistent with what you see
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the revenue Focus because again Cash
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
basis compared to plan however when we
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
move to the next step and we can have
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
this conversation again at that time
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
when we move move to the next step of
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
using fiscal year 21 as a base for 22
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
and 23 we will want to take these
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
anomalous re receivables out of the
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 amounts before applying
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
our growth rates for 22 and
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
23 I know this is probably or could be a
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
New Concept for a lot of folks so I'll
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
pause here for a minute and answer any
 
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
pause here for a minute and answer any
questions

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
I I had just a question
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner if this was a revenue that
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
would otherwise been assumed to have
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
been received um earlier in the year but
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
just received later in the year um if it
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
was consistent with being received in
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
this year why wouldn't we use it uh
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
potentially as part of the base moving
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
forward so this is revenue that we would
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
have had anticipated receiving in F
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
school year 20 we received it late in 21
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
but we don't expect it to be late again
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
so we expect this Revenue to come in
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
timely in April of this year okay got
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
ited anomalous receivable we'd
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
thanks I Al also have a question which
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
um may actually belong to the com
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
controller rather than you
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
on this these 30.8 million will show up
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
in the cafer for 20 when do they
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
disappear from the official documents
 
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.789 align:start position:0%
disappear from the official documents
for

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
21 so they will show in the cash basis
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
documents for 21 all the way through and
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
then we will reverse it and put the new
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
acral in for the fiscal year 21
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
cafer so it will only show up when we
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
get to the the preliminary acral
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
statement in next June next July correct
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
thank you linday PAB bramy hi hi um it's
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
is it true that these are revenues that
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
were really generated in
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
2019 profits that's been taxed for both
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
the business tax and the interest and
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
dividends correct these would be well
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it could be a variety of things
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
um but especially for amounts that we
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
received in July as I said those are
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
likely um extension payments or estimate
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
payments that would have been due in
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
April and the date extended to
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
July right I what I'm getting at is that
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of these revenues were generated
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
preco correct correct yes the underlying
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
tax period for a lot of them would be
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
preco um however it could be estimated
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
pay at the beginning of Co um but
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
certainly the return or extension
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
payments would be for um tax year 2019
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
you okay hearing no other questions we
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
will move into the specific taxes and
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to Melissa to
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
rentals sure good morning everyone um so
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
this layout should look pretty similar
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
to what you've seen before we tried to
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
keep it pretty consistent from our last
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue um estimate presentation we gave
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
you um we have up top we did produce
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
ranges this time which you're you're
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with us because we typically do
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
that however I think our last ones we
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
did not do estimate ranges but because
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're unsure as to where fiscal year 21
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
could end um based on how the next six
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
months go we felt like we'd give you
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
that low and high range like you've seen
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
in Prior Year's past um the top portion
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
we have our Dr revised fiscal year 21
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
estimate ranges low and high and some ex
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
explanation as to where we got um or how
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
we got to those those numbers and then
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the next section we have factors to
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
consider which just give um some bullet
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
points and high level um notes on what
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
you might want to factor in when
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
choosing your Revenue estimates and then
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see when we get to the next page
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
page um or sometimes it's on the same
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
page we actually show you the breakout
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the adjustments each month compared
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
to plan um for the high and the low as
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
well as a chart that um is just sort of
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
a snippet from the first chart that
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
Lindsay went went over that shows you
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
plan and then our high and low estimate
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
compared to plan so I just wanted to
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
make you
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the layout as we get
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
started because you'll see this through
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
each text that we go through
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to sort of bounce around
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
on the slides um to just what sort of
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
makes sense on how we go so starting off
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
with meals and rentals tax um just as a
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
note the historical breakdown of the
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
components between the meals and rentals
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
tax is typically 80% for meals 177% for
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and then 3% for motor
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles um this tax obviously has been
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
pretty impacted by covid-19 uh fiscal
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
year to date we're 35.8 million or
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
23.3% below
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
plan and then fiscal year to date um
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're 26.5 million or 18.4 million below
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
prior year that's as of October that
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
does not include the November numbers um
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
what we have so far for no November
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to be almost we're probably
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 14 to 15% below
 
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.830 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 14 to 15% below
plan

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
um as you know covid-19 has had an
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
effect um a pretty good effect on
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
selling meals and Rental renting rooms
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
and renting Motor Vehicles coupled with
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates um and consumer
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
confidence we had um sort of the state
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
shutdown had occurred and has since
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
opened back up but as you know covid-19
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
numbers are rising which is obviously
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
going to impact the wi winter months and
 
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.669 align:start position:0%
going to impact the wi winter months and
consumer

00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
spending um with this tax we also wanted
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
to note that um we've seen some shifts
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
in this tax um especially when we saw
 
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.789 align:start position:0%
in this tax um especially when we saw
the

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
shutdown there was a large shift from
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
sit down restaurants of course those
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
were were partially closed um internal
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
or partially closed to people going into
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
the restaurants so we saw the shift of
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
fast food to fast food restaurants and
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
then we saw similar shifts for hotels as
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
those were opened back up to people um
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
um staying at camps and Cottages or
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
during online platforms versus staying
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
at the big hotels so just some stats for
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
this tax um for September activity which
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
was reported in October fast food was up
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
99.6% um ahead of Prior year so they had
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
returned to normal and actually exceeded
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
where they were at um prior to covid uh
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant full Services were down 6.4%
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
compared comp to Prior year um so
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
obviously they have made some pretty
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
good gains but they haven't returned
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
back to normal and then the total food
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
in Industry which includes the
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant and the fast foods are down
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
4.6% and then looking at the large C the
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
other large category the hotels um
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
rental agents so your online platforms
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
um those are up
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
86.7% compared to Prior year so that's
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
that shift that I was was just talking
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
about whereas hotels just your standard
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
hotels are down
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
29.6 um so I think because of the
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic people are sort of Shifting how
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
they are um during sort of their
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
stations or their vacations um and
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
probably feeling more comfortable in a
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
smaller setting than in a large setting
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
so I just want to give you some
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
background on that and sort of let you
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
know where we're at so then I can
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
discuss the highs and
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
lows so just ask Could you um send us an
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
email with those percentages that you
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
just mentioned sure great thank you um
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
Alissa it looks like Senator Dee has a
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
question okay go ahead Senator de uh
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um my my question
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
is have any of your projections included
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
the potential cut uh in the meals and
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
rooms ta rentals tax I know that
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh people are thinking that uh the
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
elasticity of of restaurant meals is 2.3
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that you know by cutting the tax
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to decrease it or uh
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
increase um the the uh um income uh for
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
that but um given that the reason well a
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the past on the cigarettes we seem
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have found that cutting the tax is
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
not the same as cutting the price and
 
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.430 align:start position:0%
not the same as cutting the price and
and

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
secondly um if the problem is not the
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
price but a fear of covid um is is
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
cutting it going to what what would your
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
estimate be on whether or not um
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
lowering the tax rate is going to
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
revenues yeah so so just as um an
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
important note when we do our our
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
estimates we do it on current law um we
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
don't factor in proposed um proposed
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments to any any bills or taxes so
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a great question um
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
just to get that out there right up
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
front this is all based on current law
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
and not based on any proposed bills that
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
have come through um I don't have an
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
answer for you yet on an analysis of how
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the M&amp;R tax rate would would perform
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
if cut I do know I have heard um heard
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
it in the news being proposed that don't
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
think Dr has seen anything yet or has
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
done a proposal on what M&amp;R tax would
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
me thank you representative abrami has a
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
question as
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
well hey he Melissa how are you good to
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
have you so um this is I I know the
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
answer to the question but someone asked
 
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
me this the other day I just wanted to
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
uh when we're saying when we're talking
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
plan here and then for all the other
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
slides that have plan on it we are
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the budgeted plan
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
unadjusted by any of our our other
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
estimates that we did in in the spring
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is the budgeted number that was
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
originally adopted correct yes okay I
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that uh that
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
point I thought that was the answer but
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
someone asked me and I said well I don't
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
think it was adjusted but uh so we're
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
talking about against the plan that we
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
we came up with uh almost two years ago
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
thank you right thank you that's that's
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
a great question we have done estimates
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's been some numbers put out there
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
but as of right now the plan is still
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
the official plan right thank you
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
sure okay so moving on to Dr revised
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 estimate ranges um
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
Melissa I'm sorry it looks like
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
represent Aly wants to get into sorry I
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
can't see when there's a hand rais so
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
right and I'm having trouble remembering
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
which one is with on mute and unmute um
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
yes and i' I'd heard that too and and
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
followed it up and just to make sure and
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
on we are operating on the original ones
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind everybody that
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
when we did the original ones at least
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
when it left the house and I think
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
partially still after it left the
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on the we had
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
programmed in a reduction in activity
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
for this year on the idea that there
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
sometime so that the plan is a little
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
bit lower than it would have been if
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
we'd been thinking that that the economy
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
Busters okay any further questions
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
before I go on or
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
statements okay
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
so back to um the low so our low uh
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
adjustment is 94.6 million or 24% below
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
plan um these reductions were made based
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
on past M&amp;R performance um uh really
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months they were
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
also anticipated with seeing deeper
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
losses in colder months and a slower
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
recovery as it tends to warm um in the
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
spring and a vaccine is made more
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
available um um to the public so in
 
00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
order to get this low point in revenues
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
we adjusted revenues to mirror December
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
through April April which essentially
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
was what we saw um for August Revenue
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
which is July activity which is a loss
 
00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:15.549 align:start position:0%
which is July activity which is a loss
of

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
25% with a recovery similar to what we
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
saw through October and November of 19%
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
and 177% oh excuse me a loss of 25
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
negative 25% % um for October and
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
November and then we sort of decreased
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
that loss like we said as consumer
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
confidence gains to a loss of1 19% and
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
177% for May and June um and again
 
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to see this on the next
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
slide you'll be able to see how these
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
months sort of trend out so you can see
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
the comparison each month compared to
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
low and
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
high and then for our high point of
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
where we thought estimates could
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
potentially fall um again we based this
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue over the last month so each
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
month for M&amp;R we have slowly seen some
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
gains um from a low of
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
55% in May which was a loss compared to
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
Prior year for April activity to um the
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
best month that we had had was a loss of
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
11% which was in October um so you could
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
see had seen some gains so with our high
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
we trended that out and made it similar
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
to what we expect to see this month um
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
so we adjusted Revenue to continue that
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
15% loss for winter and spring months
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
which is what we'll see for November and
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
then we're accelerating that gain to a
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
10% um loss starting in April so we're
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
anticipating again in the higher months
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we we're not going to drop much
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
lower than what we're seeing right now
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
for activity and then we'll see it pick
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
up in April as people start to come out
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccine and people start to
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
become more comfortable with um
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
venturing out and staying at hotels and
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
restaurants again so Lindsay if you want
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
slide thanks and here you can see that
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Trend that we were talking about um in
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
the first chart is fiscal year the first
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
half of it is fiscal year 21 actual this
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
does include the anomalous Revenue so
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
you can see where the trends
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
um were going from ative 34% to 25% 17
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
to 19 and then for fiscal year 21 to
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
plan um these are our estimates so the
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
top numbers the 15% for November and
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
ending at agga 17% for June that's the
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
low that's what we just spoke about
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
where we anticipate this month being a
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
15% % and then dropping down in the
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
winter months to a bigger loss of - 25%
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
and then sort of coming back out of it
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
in May and June equaling a total loss
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
for the year of negative
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
24% and then for the meals and rentals
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
High that's the line below that um again
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
you can see we keep November at the 15%
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
but then we sustain that loss through
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
March not dropping any lower than where
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're at today and then bringing it back
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
up earlier than our low in April at a
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
-1% for and continuing that for the rest
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the year to being only a loss of 19%
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of the fluctuation that
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
we could see again we're sort of in a
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
weird time it's hard to totally predict
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
where um bees are going to go how this
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
um virus is going to continue to spread
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
and what consumer activity is going to
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
look like and then the next chart below
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
again is um like I stated before is just
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh a portion of the original chart that
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
Lindsay spoke to that has where fiscal
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
year 20 was 20 was and then fiscal year
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
21 what it looks like compared to plan
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
and then our high and low and what that
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
number is compared to
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
plan happy to answer any questions on
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
this tax before we move on yeah Melissa
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
I'm don't see how we can get anywhere
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
near that high uh the November number is
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
October oober activity we were in Indian
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
summer during most of October it was
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
really weird uh it was very nice but on
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of people actually came out that
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
month as the weather continued at least
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
in my area and uh it ate outside in the
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh knowing that that was
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
their last chance to do it for six
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
months at least and um
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
then they've all disappeared now that
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's winter again uh into their houses
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
and are not going to restaurants I think
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
that December is going to look like you
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
think it's going to look uh that is the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
November activity and I don't see how
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
through those winter months when people
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
would have to eat inside the
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants um that there's not going to
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
be more loss
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that's that's a good
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
point representative Elman I think we
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
took some consideration into that but I
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
think one point that um I sort of
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
glossed over that I should note is
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
something that we did see that was kind
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
of interesting when they the
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home orders took place is that I
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
think we did see restaurants make this
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
shift pretty quickly and pretty
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
impressively into being takeout
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants that we didn't see before so
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of restaurants in my area
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
that were strictly sit in they didn't do
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
a large takeout business at all has now
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
made these accommodations to do a better
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
takeout they've come up with these new
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
and Innovative you know ideas to have
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
these boxes or meal preps or um just
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
these different ideas that were not
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
present for them um back before covid
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
started so that might help sustain some
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the loss rather than them completely
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
shutting down like they like they did in
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
the earlier months um just just
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
something to to note yes I was looking
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Employment Security
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
numbers and um this one I think was from
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
a national survey that included New
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for small businesses in
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
Leisure and
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hospitality uh we are still in November
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
at 51% Revenue
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
loss though on the
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
employment as of the 7th of November was
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
91% of 2019 for restaurants and bars and
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
97% in
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
lodging uh so 80 no 87% in
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
lodging so that um lodging of course is
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
tax but um
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
um it does seem difficult to me to get
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
up to to the high so represent abami has
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just have a question Melissa
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
or or car yeah well anyway so is any has
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
this been passed by the Restaurant
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
Association or get get some reaction
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
from the industry on some of your
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
assumptions um this is our first
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
presentation of this okay out to the
 
00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:58.190 align:start position:0%
presentation of this okay out to the
public

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
I say it's something I think Ways and
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
Means would probably want to
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
do uh even earlier than better probably
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
but thank
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
you although Melissa do you want to
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
comment on the conversations you have
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
with the restaurant and Lodging
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
Association with respect to the
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
reopening task
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
force oh sure um good good point Lindsay
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
um we did do a presentation um for the
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
reopening task force that Lindsay just
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
spoke to um the restaurant and Lodging
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
Association were in attendance um we did
 
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
Association were in attendance um we did
talk

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
about where we what we have seen and how
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
quick we dropped down in our April
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
revenues um like I said to that negative
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
55% and then how much we have recovered
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
and how quickly we sort of recovered or
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
fast we recovered I know we're not back
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
to normal but it was a lot quicker than
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated um and part of that Trend
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the sort of what we had
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
presented part of part of that Trend um
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
was that we weren't seeing as many
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
closed restaurants as we thought we were
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to see for um that March through
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
August time frame um I think most people
 
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to see this
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
massive drop in in restaurants and it
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
sort of seems like what we had seen and
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
I I think part part of this was du due
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
to maybe the Main Street Relief Fund um
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
the self employment livelihood fund and
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
some of that government uh stimulus
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
money is that we saw a drop in their
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
revenues but it seems like more
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants had come back than
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
anticipated um and when we did do the
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
presentation um the restaurant
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
industries were on the phone and they
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have any comment for us at that
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
point based on what we were seeing or
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
what we were anticipating seeing so they
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
they did have some idea of what what we
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
were looking at um again we didn't have
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
the high and low numbers that we have at
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
this point but I do think that um
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
Lindsay has a good point it's important
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
to note that we didn't see as many
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
closures that we had um that we thought
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
we were going to anticipate obviously
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
we'll keep an eye on that as the months
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
continue to to grow but it it felt like
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was a little bit insulated
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
compared to what um other states had
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
seen in terms of um closures in the loss
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
of activity in the return of activity
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
for the meals and rentals
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions on M&amp;R or are
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:51.589 align:start position:0%
 
forward

00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay on to the tobacco tax
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
this might give me oh there we go okay
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
good we're able to get it all on the
 
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.349 align:start position:0%
good we're able to get it all on the
same

00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
screen um so um for the tobacco tax I'll
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
go through uh everything in a similar
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
way to Melissa so our breakdown of
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue is primarily due to the sale of
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
cigarette pack stamps so 92% of Revenue
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
is from cigarette stamps which you'll
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
see on the bottom of packages of
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and 8% is from other tobacco
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
products and that can be um your
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes now that can be um your
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
loose tobacco products um things of that
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
nature so fiscal year to date we are 15
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
million or
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
20.4% ahead of
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
plan um and we are 16.1 million or
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
22.2% ahead of Prior year the tobacco
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
tax has been a bit of a shining light
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to revenues um we're
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
seeing a little bit of an opposite
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
effect where covid is not resulting in a
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
decrease of Revenue but instead is
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
resulting in increased
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue um we saw this at the beginning
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic where it appeared as
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
though the wholesalers who are
 
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for purchasing the tobacco
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
tax stamps were kind of stocking up on
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
stamps I think due to some uncertainty
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
about what the pandemic was going to
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
bring were they going to be able to
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
continue to access the Dr in order to
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
purchase their stamps so there was a bit
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
of a stock up um it appears as though
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
they utilized some of that inventory but
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
then we've seen them stock up again um
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of theories out there
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
um one of which is although smoking is
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
not uh a good correlation to your
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
ability to recover from covid um there
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
are other people saying that given the
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
stress and anxiety around the pandemic
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
um that it is not the most conducive
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
time for folks to decide to quit smoking
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
either um so we have seen positive stamp
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
sales there's another point that I would
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
like to mention which is um the state of
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in June baned mentholated
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
and other flavored tobacco products and
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
we believe we've seen a pretty
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
significant increase in Revenue due to
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
that and again I was speaking to the
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the state of Rhode
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
Island and Rhode Island is seeing
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
similar increases in mentholated and
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
flavored tobacco tax St sales in their
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
state as well um so the the increase
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we've seen is consistent with the
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
timing of the ban in
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and as many of you know
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
especially those that have been on the
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee for quite some time um New
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh has a lot of crossborder
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax sales if you were to take
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
our um tobacco tax sales and do a new
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
per capita rate of smoking based on the
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire it would be
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
a very staggering amount um we which is
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
not true um given the lowest have given
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the lowest tobacco
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
tax tax rate um in New England we see a
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
significant number of crossb sales so we
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
sell into Massachusetts and other New
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
England states quite a bit so in order
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
to produce our ranges um our low is 32.1
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
million or 16% ahead of plan and this is
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
based on the numbers continuing to
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
increase um but but starting to slow
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
their uh usage of uh tobacco products
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
this is potentially due to more people
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
becoming unemployed having less
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
disposable income also not willing to
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
venture out or the inability to come
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire to purchase their um
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
tobacco products and then returning to
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
their home state for instance in
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now required to quarantine
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
if you come into New Hampshire um so
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
that may have an impact on the tobacco
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
tax and that's what we're trying to
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
reflect with our low
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
amount with our high amount which is
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
43.6 million or 22 perc ahead of plan
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
this would be if we continue on the same
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
path that we're on um people continue to
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
smoke potentially smoke more continue to
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
stock up and the crossb sales continue
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
at the rates that we are currently
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
seeing so at the uh bottom part of the
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
page again this is very consistent with
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
the the layout from the other taxes um
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see we anticipate um between a 16
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
to 25% increase compared to plan um for
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
the winter months that does slow to 11%
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
or 20% for the high as we come into the
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
spring as again we kind of come out of
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um and hopefully people uh
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
do start smoking less um and that
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
produces the 16% ahead of plan versus
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
the 22% ahead of plan the chart at the
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
bottom will show you our plan is
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
20.2 and we are estimating between
 
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.870 align:start position:0%
20.2 and we are estimating between
233.356

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
233.356
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
2 44.8 somewhere between 32.1 and 43.6
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
million ahead of plan we have spent some
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
time looking at this because as folks
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
know if you've been on this committee
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
for a while tobacco tax consistently has
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
a 3% decrease year-over-year so this is
 
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
definitely out of the norm for us to be
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase in the tobacco tax um
 
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time this is what
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
estimating I'm happy to take any
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question it's Pat
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
again so uh you have a sense of how much
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
is the menal cigarettes I think when we
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
because usually we go back and look at a
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
couple years and and mental is the m
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts gift
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
again uh is a real anomaly that I mean
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to go on forever I guess uh
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
is to it' be very helpful to get a sense
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
of how much of the 30 million above
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
projection or 35 million above
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
projection is was due to the menthol
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes being bought not being sold
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts anymore sure that's a
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
great point we don't collect that
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
information at the time that we sell the
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
stamps but we can out to our wholesalers
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
um as we come into the next few months
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
before um doing final Revenue estimates
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
and get a sense from them what they're
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
seeing in terms of increases in their
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
mentholated products happy to thank
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you if I could follow up on
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
that on if they could give us some idea
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
of how much of these increased sales is
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
um within 10 miles of the of the
 
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.829 align:start position:0%
um within 10 miles of the of the
Border

00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
Border
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
um that that would be a help also I
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
think because I don't think they're
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to want to come very far into New
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I do think that despite the
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
unless they're going to have state
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
troopers at every road along the border
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
the PE people are still going to be
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
coming in from Massachusetts to get them
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
coming in from Massachusetts to get them
inol

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
inol
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
sure we can try to get some anecdotal
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
evidence with respect to that in that
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
case we'd be looking to the retailers to
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
find out what they're seeing um in terms
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
of those retailers along the border um
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
try to get some information with respect
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
to that as
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
tax no
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
Melissa all right so another positive
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
one we we like these revenues that are
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
performing well especially during this
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
time um all right interest in dividends
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax just for a little bit of background
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
um this tax has some components that
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's made up of for tax year 2018 40% of
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
this tax was made up of taxable
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
annuities or actual cash and property
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
distributions um 38% % was made up of
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
dividend income 15% was made up of
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
interest income and 8% is federal tax
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
exempt um interest income just so you
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
know when we're looking at different
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
areas and what we're talking about
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
that's how the tax is broken down for um
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
the most completed tax
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
year so as I said this tax is performing
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
well uh fiscal year to date we're 20.1
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
million or
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
84.5% ahead of plan this is when of
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
those taxes though however I'd like to
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
point out um that Lindsay had stated
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
that has some anomalous um receivable
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue in it so about 9.2% of that 20.1
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
million um is money that should be sort
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
of tossed back into fiscal year 20 but
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
even doing so tossing those funds back
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
you can tell that we're still um up a
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
fair amount compared to
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
plan um about 10 million and then so
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year-to date
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
um ahead of Prior year is 19.8 million
 
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.870 align:start position:0%
um ahead of Prior year is 19.8 million
or

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
82.2% again with that 9.2 million in
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
there but even taking that out this tax
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be doing well I do want to
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
point out with this tax um for most of
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
you guys on on ways and means you know
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
that this tax is sort of all over the
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
place um if you looked at a 20-year
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
Trend some of our taxes are very um
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
linear and they sort of go very smoothly
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
up or down and this tax sort of has some
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
big big Peaks and valleys and and can
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
have some pretty good swings
 
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
have some pretty good swings
year-over-year

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
year-over-year
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
um this is a tax that again has 38% of
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
it is made up of some dividend income so
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
when the stock market is doing well
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see some positivity in
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
this tax which the stock market is doing
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
well or has been doing well through
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic um so obviously
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
this tax has is impacted by that um
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
right now people tend to have more money
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
in their bank so that is the interest
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
income portion of that we do know that
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
interest rates are low but still the
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
more money in the bank produces more
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
interest which produces um more revenue
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
for us and then as I said uh so far this
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
tax appears to be unaffected by covid-19
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
to date um every month it has exceeded
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
plan it hasn't fallen below plan um yet
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
so we definitely um took that into
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
consider ation when we were doing our
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
highs and lows and facted that
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
in so looking up to our fiscal year 21
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
estimate ranges we have a low of 16.4
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
million or 14% ahead of plan and a high
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
of 23.8 million or 20% ahead of plan um
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
as you can see we don't anticipate this
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
tax falling below plan for the next six
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
months or any massive
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
reduction so the way we got to the 16.4
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
million or 14% ahead of plan um is we
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
adjusted December through June to be a
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
negative 4% below plan this equates the
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
the estimated loss of GDP for the year
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
of a ne-3 tog -4%
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
um below prior year and how we sort of
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
Justified this or looked at it is that
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
we could see this potential loss for
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
these months in the final true up of the
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter estimate payment or these
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
returns coming through so we have three
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the four estimate payments in already
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
and we know those have been performing
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
well what we don't know is what the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
January payment um is going to look like
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
so that's the fourth quarter estimate
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
payment it could potentially do well
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
which is what we anticipated in our High
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
um estimate but there also is we did
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
want to be cautious um and note that
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
some some people could now be really
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
like looking into things and again
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
shwing up that last quarter estimate
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
payment so that's where the 3 to 4% loss
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
came in for the estimate piece of it and
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
then the other piece of it is obviously
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
the returns and extension payments that
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
will be coming in in April um again we
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate in our low that there might
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
be a loss on these returns as taxpayers
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
um are TR up their their income versus
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
what they actually reported to us if
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
they paid um had paid too much or had
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
requested refunds so again it's we
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated a 4% loss um for the
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
December through June payments in the
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
low range which still results in a in a
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
us being ahead of
 
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
plan and then for the high which was the
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
20% of plan we adjusted um November
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
through June to be 4% ahead of plan um
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
this equals to about 4% the 4% growth we
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
saw in September which was the last
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
estimate payment we've received in the
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
largest month we had in this current
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so again that's definitely a
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
posit uh a possibility where we're going
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
to end up um but we wanted to make sure
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we didn't get too excited about
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
this just continuing to grow when we do
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that there could be a possibility
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
um of it being adjusted for those last
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
the next six months as the trups start
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
to happen um Lindsay if you could go to
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
the next slide Melissa it looks like
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
Senator de has a question before you go
 
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.510 align:start position:0%
Senator de has a question before you go
on

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure oh I can wait till after after she
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
goes through this okay and this just um
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
for the visual people this just makes a
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more easy to see what we were
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
were chatting about um for our low um we
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
have a 0er to 4% for November having
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
November be flat and then decreasing um
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
December through June like I spoke about
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
at that 4% which was matching around the
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
GDP and then for our high again a 4%
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
growth every month compared to plan
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
equaling a 20% growth um compared to
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
plan at the end of the year versus the
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
14% growth compared to plan that equates
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
to ending up our plan would be 11 16.9
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
133.33

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
133.33
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
million happy to answer your question
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
now senator be okay uh thank you Melissa
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so my question is uh given that uh
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
people can now uh choose to uh
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
divert uh their taxes into educational
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
scholarships uh how what is the estimate
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
for how much of that diversion will be
 
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
for how much of that diversion will be
taking

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
place um sure that's a good question so
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
that was implemented where they could
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
use interest in dividends tax against
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit um last year or
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
two two years ago and they could use it
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the last year's return um we did not
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
I although there was a lot of talk and
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
some speculation that we were going to
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
see a large increase um of people
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
donating to take advantage of the tax
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
credit especially in the indd area we
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
have not seen um that large Spike as
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated I don't have numbers in
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
front of me but I do remember um
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
reporting to the the expenditure
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee on that and it was it was
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
minimal in terms of um affecting the
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
revenues thus far I do also administer
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
that tax at the Department of Revenue
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we have not for this year again have
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
not seen a large Spike for individual um
 
00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
not seen a large Spike for individual um
taxpayer

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
donations thank you you're welcome so so
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
I put my hand up I don't know if you can
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards has a question
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa yes it's representative Edwards
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa I appreciate um the question
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
particularly when you probably hadn't
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
prepared for the question about the uh
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
educational donations but would you mind
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
just um sending us via email your best
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
quantitative estimate uh when you get a
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
chance no
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
hurry sure
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely are there any other questions
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
on I I would like to ask has is there
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
any research on the relationship between
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
the dividends paid out in December which
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
are a very large part of the dividends
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
and on the stock market I find I'm
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
always surprised every
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
down do you mean do we see them
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
um in the January estimate
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
payment actually it wouldn't be in our
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
numbers it would be in research on the
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
stock Mark economic research on the
 
00:59:21.799 --> 00:59:22.670 align:start position:0%
stock Mark economic research on the
stock

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
stock
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
market right so are you looking to
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
understand cor potential correlation
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
between the stock market and then what's
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
paid in dividends in December yes
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
specifically yeah we haven't looked into
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
that because we don't know the timing
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily of when the Dividends are
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
paid we just have the total amount of
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
dividends um but if we come across that
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
in anything that we're doing as part of
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
our research we'll be sure to uh share
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
that with you well they do um produce
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
reports on the amount of dividends paid
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
by the major corpor operations I
 
00:59:57.599 --> 00:59:59.430 align:start position:0%
by the major corpor operations I
believe

00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and I do know as a person that the
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
dividends all land in
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
December once they the businesses know
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
how their years have something like five
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
or 10% at the most that come any other
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
time sure yeah if we come across
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
anything with respect to that we'll be
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
you okay moving on to the Comm
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
communication Services
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
tax so this I think could be a pretty
 
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
tax so this I think could be a pretty
quick

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
conversation um CST is performing very
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
close to plan um we're just about
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
400,000 or 2.9% below plan for fiscal
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
year to date and um slightly ahead of
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
Prior year 200,000 or
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
1.5% um one thing to note which I might
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
help to explain why we're below plan but
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
ahead of Prior year um this is the
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
second year of VoIP and prepaid calling
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
cards being taxable we did anticipate
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.5 million of additional
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue in the Surplus statement for
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 um so it looks like maybe
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
we're just performing slightly below uh
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
what we anticipated with respect to the
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement amounts at least to
 
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.510 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement amounts at least to
date

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
um uh our our estimate here we didn't
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
feel the need um to produce a range
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
since we're so close to plan and so
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
close to PR prior year um so our
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
estimate is about just under a milion
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
900,000 or 2% below plan by the end of
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the year um we're just continuing this
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
approximate 2% um loss from plan we're
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
just projecting that out through the end
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
year what we think we have going on here
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
like I said is a potential either
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
underutilization or vo of VoIP um maybe
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
as people are not sitting at their
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
businesses which businesses are very um
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
large users of VoIP um or we may have
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
just slightly overestimated the
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue that would come in
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
from VoIP and prepaid calling cards and
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
that being offset obviously by increased
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
online video usage as we're doing today
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
online video platforms and the the
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
taxability relative to those we talked
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
about that and sent the committee some
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
information about that um with our prior
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
presentation so all in all um CST looks
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
to be just about a million under plan by
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
the end of the year and again we didn't
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
feel the need to produce a higher low
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
change lindsy Could you um remind us
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
again of what how you tax video
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
conferencing is it it when I when I pay
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
my $100 whatever it is a year or when
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
someone pays $14 a month is that what
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
the taxes applied
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
to Melissa may know more specifically I
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into any of the
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
individual um providers and any of their
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
individual returns but to the expect to
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
the extent that it's two-way
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
communication that is taxable but I at
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
least initially don't have an exact
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
answer to your question and if Melissa
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't we can certainly get back to
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
you yeah I mean the only the minimal
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
part that I can add is like Lindsay said
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
we did look into this I think you had a
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
question for us um I don't know six
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
months back or so representative alme or
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
maybe five months back when this started
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
to verify that it was taxable um and we
 
01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
did run every everything through audit
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
to verify that it is taxable and it does
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
flow through um on these corporations
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
returns how each of them assess it
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's assessed on the bill or
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're just building in I'm I'm unsure
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
as to that answer so we can try to get
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
some more information for you on that
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mrs patan um Lindsay or
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
Melissa either um this this is the
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
landline tax correct for the most part
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
correct right and which we know it's
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
dying uh so I'm sure the part of the
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
negativity on this is that trying to
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
figure out you know less and less people
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
have landlines now we we talk about this
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
every year and U really don't see any
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
recovery on that that end so um but it's
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
you know I'm surprised it's only
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
negative2 I think we did a pretty good
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
job with our estimate two years ago you
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
know we did so I think you guys were
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
very very good at this so all right but
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
it's we're dealing with a tax here
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's really uh dying slowly before us
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh I mean there still there still always
 
01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:38.150 align:start position:0%
uh I mean there still there still always
be

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
landlines but you know especially
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
businesses but I mean I even got rid of
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
my landline a while ago um but because I
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
just got junk mail on it so um Jun junk
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
U yeah voicemails so anyway um but again
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a tax that on its own
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
forget about the
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
virus uh is is is dying a slow slow
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
death is that a correct statement
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
certainly part part of the tax the
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
landlines as we have all talked about
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
are certainly decreasing the addition of
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
VoIP and prepaid calling cards um from
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
two years ago um is helping to to
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
bolster that tax um and we did
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate and there are amounts in the
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement for additional revenue
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
for that and as time goes on we'll see
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
how those specific um uh
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
revenue streams perform um but our our
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
hope I think or our thought is that over
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
time this will become more stable as
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to the decline that we were
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
you it's uh have Val me again um maybe I
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
asked this five six months ago too but
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
on I am I have my land line is a cable
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
line and a lot of us now have switched
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
to table as for our phones because it's
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
part of a package on I drilled down
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
which took a lot of time into my Comcast
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh a few years ago and discovered
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
that they were out of something like 200
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
and something dollars a month that they
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
charge me on I was paying $7 for the the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
um phone part of
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
it they arbitrarily allocate a very
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
small amount to the phone because that
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
one gets
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
taxed and I don't think there's anything
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
we can do about that but but so those of
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
us that still have landlines when we're
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
on cable it's a nothing right and and
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're right they do tend to package
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
them as part of a package deal cable
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
internet and phone um and they kind of
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
throw the phone in there and I wouldn't
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not surprised by what you found when
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
you drilled down that the lowest percent
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're ready to move on to
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
tax all right real estate transfer tax
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
um this one has been performing well um
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
again we like to throw this in the in
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
the positive the positive
 
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.990 align:start position:0%
the positive the positive
bucket

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
bucket
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year to date we are little
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
over half a million or a little under 1%
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
ahead of
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
plan and um fiscal year to date compared
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
to Prior year were 3 million or 4.8%
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of ahead of plan what's important
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
to note with that even though those
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
numbers look low is that um we did have
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
a $5 million transfer um I think in
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
September um to the affordable housing
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
fund which was new um this is something
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
new that was put into statute so
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
typically that has not happened in Prior
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
years past so if you added that transfer
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
that $5 million that we've already taken
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
out of the revenue back in you know we'd
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
be 5.6 million ahead of plan or 8
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
million ahead of Prior year so I just
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
think that's important to note so you
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
can see that it is doing better than
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
just that half a a little over half a
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
million above
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
plan um this tax there's been sort of a
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
lot of press around it people are
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
watching it because it has been doing
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
really well um obviously what factors
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
into the real estate transfer tax is the
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
availability of Housing and property
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
values um as those property values
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
continue to increase obviously the real
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax being paid will
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
increase um same with the amount of
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
sales that are going through will impact
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
um how much tax is being paid we do know
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
that there's top
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
of there that we have a housing shortage
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
um and trying to factor in when we'll
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
feel that effect um has been challenging
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
but we try to do our best with our high
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
and low ranges um also with this tax we
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
know that mortgage interest rates are
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
being historically low and they seem to
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
to be continuing that way um there's
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
this new virtual home sales that I don't
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire had really seen
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic um I had set on a
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
couple conference calls with Realtors
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
concerning this and it was so
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear them speak about um
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
as the pandemic happened they were
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
quickly throwing together these virtual
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
home sales and they were talking about
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
how they were selling these homes to
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
people coming from Massachusetts and
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
they were buying homes without even
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
seeing them they were doing everything
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
through virtual walkthroughs um and
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
again just something different that you
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think of of buying a house
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
based on what you saw through video
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
versus actually stepping into the house
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
um that plays a little bit of a factor
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
into our Revenue estimates because when
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic first started this was
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
brand new and um wasn't I think readily
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
available or widely used whereas as you
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
fast forward now these five months or so
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
um this is definitely something that I
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
think will help reals through the winter
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
months and sort of keep those home sales
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
going as restrictions potentially um
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
come up for out ofate
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
travel um this OB obviously factors to
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
consider for this obviously is how is
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
the recovery of the economy going how is
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate going and then
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence obviously people
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
think they're not going to keep their
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
jobs through these winter months or we
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
think unemployment is going to increase
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
or decrease that will obviously affect
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
this tax um again R continues to perform
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
well with large
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
gains however um we keep hearing about
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
this inventory St short um excuse me
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
shortage uh that we're waiting to see
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
when this will run out as well as
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
potentially some stuned construction in
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
the winter months um might make some
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
buyers weary of of holding off until
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
come spring and there's a vaccine we did
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
put some numbers in here at the bottom
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
of this factors to consider we often
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
look at New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
Association of realators website to sort
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
of say what they're saying they have a
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
great every month and every quarter of
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
what things are looking like um so I
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
believe this was based on the
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
October um it was reported in October
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
based on September sales so they were
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying despite being tightening of
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
lending standards and high and
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
employment buyers are out in full force
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
this fall showing Amazing resilience in
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
the middle of the pandemic um and then
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
there are just some stats about new
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
listing for single family homes were up
 
01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:55.390 align:start position:0%
listing for single family homes were up
88.1%

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
88.1%
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
um pending sales increased almost 40%
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
for single homes median sale prices were
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
up 15% for single homes and then the
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
piece that we were just keep talking
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
that I was just talking about about the
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
monthly Supply decreased to
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
63.2% for single
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
homes um with this tax this for those of
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
you that don't know this tax is reported
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
to us on the 10th of the month so we do
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
already have November um November
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
November for just what the counties
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
report to us
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
um this is gross revenue for dollars
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
wise they were up
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
22.9% for November and you'll see this
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
in our um monthly reports that get
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
emailed at at the end of the month um
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm sort of giving you an inside
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
preview and then Melissa sure represent
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
questiones yeah thank you I could have
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
waited till you were finished but that's
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
fine I've heard from several sources
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
that high-end properties have been doing
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
especially well and I wondered if you
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
had seen that or you just think it's
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
across the
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
board um we don't actually see what the
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
sales are on however I have read that as
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
well but I have also read that the
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
quickest turnaround is actually on um
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
that 200 to
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
300,000 piece those those houses they
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
cannot stay on the market sort of those
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
first time home buyers um or people
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
downgrading in their homes those are the
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's the market that's going the
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
quickest right now thank you
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
sure and then um the last piece that I
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak about for um
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
November R October activity was that
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
transactions were up 22.1%
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so we keep waiting to see that sort
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
of decline to show that inventory
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
inventory shortage um but that hasn't
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
shown up yet in in what we're what we've
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
seen so to move back on to our fiscal
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
estimates um we adjusted this based
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
on covid-19 and the loss of revenues due
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
to people what we called hibernating
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
during the peak months of covid-19 and
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
the winter months as well as that slow
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
constru construction that I was just
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
speaking about and then um that this
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
spring and December would be a gradual
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
increase and not the same drastic
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
increase we saw during the summer months
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
of this this current year so for our low
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Lindsay for for moving on for
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
the chart it's a little bit easy to
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
speak easier to speak to um so we have
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
November plugged in there because
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
November we already know that we are
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
ending up um actually we'll probably end
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
up a little bit higher than that as some
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
more revenues come in but we're going to
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
end up somewhere 42 to
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
46% ahead of plan for November or $6.6
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
million up so November is a is a pretty
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
solid number and then we started to do
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
our estimates based on December through
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
June um so our low in December like I
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
said we sort of tampered it down to um a
 
01:15:23.639 --> 01:15:26.030 align:start position:0%
said we sort of tampered it down to um a
13%

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
13%
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and then we dropped it
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
right off for January through June to a
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
2% ahead of plan and this has to do like
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
I said with the um slowing down of
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
construction and an increase of covid-19
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
and people sort of high rotating like we
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
spoke to um as well as that inventory um
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
shortage happening and US sort of
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
returning back to normal what we were
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
seeing prior to the pandemic and these
 
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
seeing prior to the pandemic and these
large

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
increases um and then our
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
high we adjusted this for a continued
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
increase in prices again if the price
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
goes up the r that's paid goes up so
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that price that keeps going up every
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
single month um with these bidding wars
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
that are occurring we we showed that
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
that would continue to happen it would
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
be a slow decrease with November being
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
the peak um and we'd slowly drop it but
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
not as much to the low so as you can see
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
we have the 42% for November which which
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
we know and then a slow decline to 31%
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
20 20% down to a 10% for March through
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
June um ending with 12% ahead of plan so
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
the plan for this for fiscal year 21 is
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
158.4 million our low is 168 um which is
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
99.6% ahead of plan with a high of
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
1772 which is
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
18.8% ahead of plan this one's a little
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
bit tricky but happy to answer any
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions um or thoughts on where you
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
think this will end up let's that's Pat
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
again um just want to make sure I
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand the affordable housing fund
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
is in the plan number or isn't in the
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
plan number it is in the plan number is
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
is in the plan number yes it hasn't been
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
taken out yet correct it was I'm sorry
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
it was accounted to be taken out because
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's part of a um it's it's part of a
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
surplus statement item to be taken out
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the 5 million is red removed out of
 
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.629 align:start position:0%
so the 5 million is red removed out of
the

01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
plan okay so it is and then it's is
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
taken out of and then Chet you there
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
yep looking at your report from today
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
and has revenues up 6.1 million for this
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and the plan was 14.4 million does
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
that that that does or does not
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
include the affordable housing fund redu
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund has been
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
backed out is my understanding in the
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
plan that transfer was made out of the
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
general fund to the um affordable
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
housing fund so it's not in your daily
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
revenue report okay because that was
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
restricted revenue and accounted for
 
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
within the um Surplus statement okay so
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
is that taken out when we're looking at
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
actuals is that taken out once somewhere
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
along the line or is it taken out so
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
that was T that's taken out when the
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
plan's developed so when Department of
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Services puts the plan
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
together for the year they consider what
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
was in house bill one and two and then
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
they make any adjustments as per the
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement right and so in the
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
plan okay so when the revenues come in
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is the revenues we're
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
seeing as
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
actuals are the revenues with that
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
amount taken out yes yes it's been
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
carved out already it's it's been
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
beginning Year let me ask you about the
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's an end of the year
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment though correct no there's no
 
01:18:59.950 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
endof year adjustment for that that's a
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
restricted Revenue now so it's not
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
included in your unrestricted general
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue representative AB bramy if
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
I could jump in I think I understand
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
what you're asking it was a one-time
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
transfer that happened in September so
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
um it came out in September and that was
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
it so going forward when you're looking
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
every month it's unlike um the oh I'm
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
forgetting the name of the transfer we
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
do on a monthly basis lchip it's unlike
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
lchip which comes out every month the
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund came out one
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
time in in September and then that's it
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking month to month
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
when you're looking only at the month of
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
November you don't have to worry about
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
it because it only happens in that one
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
month all right but was it removed from
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
what we saw coming in in September all
 
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.550 align:start position:0%
what we saw coming in in September all
of

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
it yes yep it came out in in September
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
so September was actually five million
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
higher correct and that's what Melissa
 
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out on the previous slide which
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a second when you look at you know
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we're only6 million
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan or three million ahead of
 
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.470 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan or three million ahead of
Prior

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
Prior
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
year n about a percent ahead of plan
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
just under 5% ahead of Prior year but
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
when you look at our ranges we're saying
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
six to 12% ahead of plan that might seem
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
a little wonky that's why because when
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
you if you were to put the 5 million
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
back in for the affordable housing
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
transfer we did perform much better in
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
overall thank
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
you there's no other questions at this
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
time no other hands are up so okay
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
perfect we will move on
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the utility property tax again this
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
is pretty simple um Melissa drew the
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
Short Straw uh when we Divi up this
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
presentation um I have the much more
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
simpler ta taxes to talk about um so
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
utility property tax fiscal year to date
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
were're 900,000 or 8.9% ahead of plan
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
1.4 million or 14.6% of head of Prior
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
year we note at the top that this upt at
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
least to date does not appear to be
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted by the
 
01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted by the
co9

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
co9
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic um we do note though that we do
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a negative 10% adjustment that we
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
are applying to January and to the
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
remainder of the fiscal year um April
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
and June where we anticipate estimated
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
payments coming in and that is due to a
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in the estimated values so we
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
will the Department of Revenue sets the
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
utility property tax values and we will
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
be issuing those um at the beginning of
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
next month taxpayers will true up the
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
amounts that they have paid to date in
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
January and they will use these new
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
values for their estimates in April and
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
June so because are seeing the decrease
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the values we have adjusted um plan
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I will show you that
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the next
 
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
slide so you will see the minus 10% from
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
plan January and again in April and June
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
which results with a 3% reduction from
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
plan for the year again this is really
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
just due to the timing of um the new
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
valuations being issued in the
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
associated trups so we anticipate the
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
end of the year to land at 43 million um
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
which is down
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
1.2% from plan of
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
44.2 oh I have a question
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
sure so so why is that that 10% that's
 
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.470 align:start position:0%
sure so so why is that that 10% that's
fairly

01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
large there's a variety of reasons um
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
one some taxpayers do have some credits
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
on file which they will utilize um two
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of economic conditions and
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
other scenarios that um go into the
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
values and so those can fluctuate from
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
year to year um we also have seen in
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
past years maybe a little bit of an
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
abnormal increase in values and they're
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
kind of right sizing at this point so we
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
see the decrease um as with any year we
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
could see new property taxable property
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
come online um so going forward we could
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
see an increase but the utility property
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
tax does like I said tend to fluctuate
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
kind of year-to year based on economic
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
conditions based on um valuations and
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
nature could I ask about those credits
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
um on are they very large relative to
 
01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:58.510 align:start position:0%
um on are they very large relative to
the

01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.350 align:start position:0%
the
tax

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't have the exact numbers in
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
my head I don't believe they are very
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
large with respect to the tax at this
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
point um as a note utility property tax
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
overpayments um under statute are not
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
refundable unless the property ceases to
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
exist um so they are carry any
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
overpayments are carried forward as a
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
credit so if valuations are challenged
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
and we go through the hearing process
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
and a new value is either settled on or
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
determined um through that course um any
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
credit but it's not like the BET BPT Pro
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
no no no these would just be due to like
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
I said fluctuations in the valuations uh
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
due to the hearings process or any
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
overpayments that we
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
received didn't we have a a bill at
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative AB bramy Knows a Lot
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
About That was supposed to stabilize
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
these values that's minicipal Municipal
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
taxing not not state tax the municipal
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
version of this correct that's a good
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
point both the state values the utility
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
properties and the municipalities do as
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
well um some municipalities use our
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
values others do not but yes the the
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
bill that you're referring to that
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative rahma who worked very
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
hard and long on is related to those
 
01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.470 align:start position:0%
hard and long on is related to those
municip

01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
municip
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
values Senator de has a
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah I believe that we had a
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill um that took the boxes out of the
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
the valuation of the
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
utilities and um I believe
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
that uh may be part of what made the
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
value go down that they were now
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
considered supplies rather than
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
equipment I remember that went through
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
Means did it go through the
 
01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.430 align:start position:0%
Means did it go through the
legislature

01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
things yeah I I don't recall that either
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
um Susan yeah I don't think we saw it I
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't think I noticed it I went crawling
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
stuff I can look into that a little bit
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
more that's not ringing a bell off the
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
top of my head either but um we can get
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
some more
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
information I have a question now um um
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
Lindsay uh do you know if the utilities
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
of slowing down some of their Capital
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects though because of
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
the virus uh that's the only random
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of that would slow um
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
because of the virus or there they they
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
now normally replace certain number of
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
poles or they may replace other things
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
that increase the value uh of the assets
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
that that are being
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
taxed um I I have no reason to even ask
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
the question that that's the only random
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of that would um that
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
that Co would have any any impact on um
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
maybe especially in the in the peak
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
months of the virus when we were all
 
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
shut down perhaps they were a little
 
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
more careful but I I don't know how much
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
it really impacted these numbers but but
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
they are we know the utilities do
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects and that when they
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
do that the the the assets you know
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
values go up the property values go up
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
sure that is a good
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
point their development um and you know
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
we look very far into the future about
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
the projected um you know revenue
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
streams of these utilities as part of
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
how we value the property and so um like
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
I said there's a lot of things that can
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
go into this and result in small
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
pretty

01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
big thank
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
ches

01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
Melissa oh Melissa you're on mute shoot
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
I clicked it
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
um do you starting on the next page just
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
so I can start with the you want to
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
start on the next page yeah the factors
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
to consider if you don't mind thank you
 
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
to consider if you don't mind thank you
so

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
much okay business taxes
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
um our heavy
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
hitter so fiscal year to date we are
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
38.4 million or
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
20.7% ahead of plan again as I spoke to
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
with interest in dividends and Lindsay
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
spoke to there is a um a fair amount of
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable Revenue in here and
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's 18.3 million so even removing
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
that um we're still 20 million ahead of
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
plan um fiscal year to date and I just
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
want to note again this is through
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
October and do not uh take into
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
consideration November November Revenue
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
which I will speak to um in a moment
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date for prior Year we're
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
ahead 44.1 million or
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
24.5% and again that has that anomalous
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
receivable um so even removing that out
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
business taxes are still performing um
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
well what we looked at when creating our
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
highs and lows for this is obviously the
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
effects effect of the covid um pandemic
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
on business activity as well as
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
potential for cash flow issues that
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
could fect the ability to pay um the
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
unknown is what this what and when this
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
um federal government stimulus package
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
the second round will will occur because
 
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
we do know that the first round was was
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
helpful for these businesses with the
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
PPP in there as well as um the New
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire help that was given with the
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
Main Street Relief Fund and the self
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
employment livelihood fund
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
um we do uh anticipate that
 
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.229 align:start position:0%
um we do uh anticipate that
revenues

01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
um might not well we might have to
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
address this now because of November but
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
there there is a a small possibility
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that they um could not meet
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
plan or that they could exceed plan um
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different than what
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
we had I think shared with you with our
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
last revenues because I think we
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
anticipated quite a nose dive with these
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
taxes but that has not uh come to come
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
to fruition at this point
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
and with this um this thought that we
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
could exceed plan this is basically due
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
to September October and November month
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
to dat revenues performing well against
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
plan as well as other states um we've
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've spoken with other states in the
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
conference that Lindsay spoke about and
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
I had a revenue conference that I went
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
to and the these other states are also
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase in their plans um
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
increase in their revenues compared to
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
plan for these business taxes as well so
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're not alone and in seeing this trend
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
um when digging into this data it looks
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
like our largest taxpayers um have not
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
been in impacted by this pandemic as we
 
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.149 align:start position:0%
been in impacted by this pandemic as we
originally

01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated um we're
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
seeing um better performance compared to
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
last year in home improvement stores
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
medical Industries um technological
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
Industries and box stores uh their
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
return and um estimate and extension
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
payments are doing are doing pretty well
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
and are really pushing us to be um ahead
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
of plan so
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
far we can stay on this slide I want you
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
to note that November that's not our
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
estimate of just guessing that we're
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
going to be 182% plan ahead of plan um
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's actually what what has happened
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
um looking at the report that you're
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to get tomorrow um we're going to
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
be 20.2 million ahead of November's plan
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
um we do know again this was our large
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
companies just driving this increase in
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
payments um that amount obviously is
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
factored into our
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
estimates um we don't think that trend
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
is going to continue with these one-offs
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
but um we did want to account for it
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
because we did know that it was
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
occurring so again um in the fiscal year
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
21 estimate command to plan you see that
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
182% and that's what we have um ahead of
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
plan as of November November
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
18th so when looking at um analyzing
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
these estimates we did it similar to how
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
we had spoke to in our original um
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
presentation to the last time we were
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
here which is where we looked at each
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
individual payment type that we receive
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so return payments extension payments
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
estimate payments tax notice payments
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
refunds and we adjusted those compared
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
to um prior history uh as well as the
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
effects of where we thought covid-19
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
would have on those because we're
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
obviously talking about a couple of tax
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
years here and it's based on activity
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's delayed on some levels so we
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
really went down to more of a
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
um more finite detail when looking at
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
these types of payment vouchers than we
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
would have in the past so there's lot of
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
numbers here um I'm going to go through
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask any questions at the
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
end in case it gets confusing um there
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
isn't much difference to our or there is
 
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
really no difference between our low and
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
our high when it comes to our extension
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
and return payments and estimate
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
payments the big adjustments are in the
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
refunds which I'll speak to but I just
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
want you to note note
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
that so first off like I said um we
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted November to anticipate amount
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
of 35 million um for the month plan was
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
12.4 Million um and this is based on the
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
revenue received as of November 18th and
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
then we trended that out for the
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
remaining month to come up with the 35.5
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
million so that that number is an
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
estimate but I think we'll get pretty
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
that after November we started looking
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
at each month individually and then
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
based on those different payment
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
vouchers that I had just spoke of so for
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
returns and extension payments um we
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated a 3% increase for return and
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
extension payments compared to plan
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
which we applied through December and
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
January so December through January
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
returns and extension payments we think
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
those were going to increase by 3%
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year this 3% was based
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
on um the gain that we saw from March 20
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
through October 20 um compared to Prior
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
year so those were returns that came in
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
had already see a g seen a G have seen a
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
gain and we anticipated that gain
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
continuing for December through
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
January this percentage was then reduced
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
to negative 18% for excuse me that
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
should say February for February through
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
June so that is a
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
heavier heavier loss um but that makes
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
sense when you think about what we've
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
seen so far was delayed activity that
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't fully affected by covid-19 for
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
return and extension payments and then
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see for January
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
through June are going to be these
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
returns where most of their activity was
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic you're going to see our big
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
months in March and April where the
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
returns are due and then um some of the
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year filers will continue through
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
through that point so this negative 18%
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
where we we came up with that is we we
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
worked very hard going back and forth um
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
on trying to find out if we can have any
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
correlation or find out any Trend to see
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
um if this covid-19 situation could be
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
tied to anything we've seen in the past
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
so we started looking at the prior
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
recession and I want to note that we
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
know that this is very different than
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
the prior recession um but we did see
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
some similar trends when it came to how
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
estimate payments and return and
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
extension payments had performed so what
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
we did was take what we saw in the prior
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um recession and then we made some
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments to correlate correlate it to
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
this economic environment um which
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
resulted in this negative
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
18% so that's where we think we'll see
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
this bigger hit in January through
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
June after we adjusted the returns and
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
extensions we took a look at the
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
estimate payments because again those
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
are a different animal than returns and
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
extension payments those are based are
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
sort of more re can be sort of more
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
realtime data
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
um estimates compared to plan were
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
reduced by 10% for November through
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
January so that's sort of the last
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
quarter of the 2020 estimate payments
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we're receiving right now so that
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
is um full pandemic activity in there
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
and again that 10% is tied to how um
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
estimates performed March 2020 through
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
October 2020 so we just said they're
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to continue to Trend out that have
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
they they have trended through this
 
01:37:56.679 --> 01:37:58.990 align:start position:0%
they they have trended through this
entire

01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
time um we then adjusted that reduction
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
of 10% to make it 3% below plan for
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
February through June so we did that for
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
February through June because now you're
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
coming into the next set of estimates
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 and as um this
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic starts to an adjust as well as
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
you know a potential government stimulus
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
package we may not see that large loss
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
of 10% it may be reduced down to 3% for
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
those estimate payments as well as that
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
percent correlates to we talked about it
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
with interest and dividends that's the
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
estimated um GDP loss for the year of
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
the 3 to 4
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
per. with tax notices we didn't make any
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments to those I think when we
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
last spoke we had made adjustments to
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
those because we anticipated um seeing
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
large losses in tax donce payments based
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
on taxpayers ability to pay if you look
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
at our monthly um payment type report
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
that comes out um you you'll note that
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
tax notice payments have basically
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
resumed to normal um and our collection
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
in audit activity has resumed so we can
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
assume that those will probably contain
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
to perform as normal and didn't need
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
adjustments so what I've stated so far
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
for our low it's the same factors that
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
we use for our high so here's the
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
difference when we we here's the
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
difference between our low and high it
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
it comes down to
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
refunds so refunds for the year were
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
increased by
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
45% we essentially increased them by
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
118% each month through December through
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
June and made some modifications to them
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
so what we did is essentially adjusted
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
them to match last year's refunds and
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know we had a lot of conversation
 
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
last year about anomalous refunds and
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
anomalous payments um
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
and we know that those anomalous refunds
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
from last year were were largely from
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
large corporations and because the large
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
corporations are driving the increase
 
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
this year um it wasn't out of the realm
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
or out of our you know us anticipating
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
where we're going to land to think that
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
that could happen again this year um we
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
know we saw last year taxpayers making
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
these large payments and then turned
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
around and asked for some refunds on
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
them um so we wanted to put in a factor
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe when these returns are filed
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
in April um March and April that in uh
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me January through June because
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
we have fiscal year filers in there that
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be asking for some of
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
those funds back um so that's our low
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
range getting us to 17.7 million below
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
plan or 2% below
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
plan and then our high range like I said
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
is basically the same thing that I went
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
over where with our estimated
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
adjustments for estimate payments
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
returns and extensions but we did not
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
adjust refunds out so we left refunds at
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
where we anticipate them coming in this
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
year which is around 44 million which is
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
anticipated in plan um and that's where
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
you sort of saw our swing and that's
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
just with the assumption that what these
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying is they're not
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
going to ask for this massive refund
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
back at the end of the year that what
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're paying is pretty true to what
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to pay and
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
we're just going to see refunds sort of
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
settle in as they normally settle in so
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
all those adjustments that I spoke about
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
above is where the correlation um comes
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
down into the chart that Lindsay just
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
pulled up on the screen where you see
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
December through June so in December um
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see between our high and low
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
there's only a 1% difference not too big
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
but then when you look at January um
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
through June you start to see that that
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
larger Gap and those are those refunds
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
being adjusted every month um based on
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
how refunds are issued out percentage
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
wise and with all of those adjustments
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
it ends up with being our low is -2%
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
below plan and our high is 1% AB above
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
plan so that gets us
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um to can you scroll down just a little
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
bit further
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
Lindsay oh thank you I sorry I couldn't
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
see it on my screen um so the Dr plan or
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
786.565.4767

01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
92.2 million being 6.1 million um above
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
plan happy to answer any questions
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
Melissa representative Edwards has a
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
question he's been waiting patiently
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards hi I was looking at the
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
difference between your the Dr low and
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
high estimates for the balance of the
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
years and it looks like uh it feels like
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
you have a relatively high confidence
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
level that that of what you're saying so
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
so the next so the real question is um
 
01:43:22.589 --> 01:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
what are the what do you think the odds
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
are of us hitting that 6% business
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
profit tax is like less than
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
10% less than
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
1% are we GNA get anywhere near that 6%
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
trigger oops so just to clarify the
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
trigger is based on fiscal year
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
20 revenues that will be determined in
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
the final C that will be released next
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
month so and again the six% that you're
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
referring to is for all revenues not
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
just business tax revenues even though
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
we're triggering potentially triggering
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
the rates the 6% is 6% above or 6% below
 
01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
all re the plan for all revenues at this
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
point as we spoke to ear the earlier to
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
this committee we do not anticipate that
 
01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
there will be a change to the rates but
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
that won't be determined officially
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
until the caffer is
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
released so do you thank you the
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
correction could you put a put your own
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
estimate on that there's less than a 10%
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
chance less than a 1%
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
chance um I don't have great insight
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
into all of the accounting adjustments
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
that go into the Capper but based on our
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
revenues that we report to the cafer I
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
would not anticipate that there would be
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
a rate change thank you very much that's
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
me sorry I forgot I was not muted just
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
then um yes that that is already in
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
stone wherever it is um what I wanted to
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
ask about was what time period in the
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
Great Recession were you using we
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
ratcheted down three times and came
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
slightly up and then ratcheted down
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
again during the Great Recession
 
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.510 align:start position:0%
again during the Great Recession
and

01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
so so I think it would make a difference
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
to to how you get to
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
this this loss in the next
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
year calendar year I can see Lindsay's
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
looking and I'm trying to pull it up I
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was nine to fiscal year nine
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
10 okay that's
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
correct that that sounds like a good
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
choice to me h
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
pain okay representative shamberg has a
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
question and then um abrami and Senator
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
moris thank you and thank you all for
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
such a thorough review
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh in looking forward to developing the
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
next next bium budget if current law on
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
tax rates is changed downward should
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
policy makers expect the uh economy to
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
generate the revenue of the present
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
estimated plan in a new budget or a new
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
bium budget just a some kind of take on
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
you so are you asking what the potential
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
impact to rate changes would be on our
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections for the next
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
budget yes I believe I am okay um
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
as I said I I am gonna go out on a limb
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and say I'm not anticipating that the um
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
the rates will change and as Melissa
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we do our Revenue
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
estimates based on current law um so we
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
would do estimates based on the law as
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
it is today and then that's what the
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement really does is um take
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
into account those proposed changes um
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
and reflect them as part of revenues
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in the past with respect
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
to fluctuations in the tax rates is that
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
it is not always the case that lowering
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
the rate will um be enough to stimulate
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
so much revenue to necessarily make up
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
for the rate change but again that can
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
be hard to kind of dissect because
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things going on in the
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
economy at any given time and there's a
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
lot of things that impact Revenue so it
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
can be really hard to come at least from
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
our perspective to come to a conclusion
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
a specific conclusion um about the
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
actual impact of a rate change given
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on um that
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
impacts revenues at any given time thank
 
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.310 align:start position:0%
impacts revenues at any given time thank
you

01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner right representative bramy
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
has a question Lindsay hi again um
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
people ask me how business tax are doing
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
this year and I say pretty good uh but
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
then I I I always refrain from getting
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
too excited and I say well we got to
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
really see what the next quarter Lees
 
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:20.310 align:start position:0%
really see what the next quarter Lees
look

01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
like so I hold my breath and say well
 
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
the next quarterly is that is that is
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
that really going to be the point at
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
which we really know which way that this
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
is going to go the next quarterly
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
page I feel like I am always saying well
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
we'll know more next month we'll know
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
more next month and I've kind of now I
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
guess just been resigned to the fact or
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
gotten used to the fact that we'll know
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
more but we're never going to totally
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
know the answer until after it
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
happen but yes you know we we are
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
looking obviously to see what happens in
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
December those will be fourth quarter
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
estimates for most calendar year
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that is the time when it is
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
most likely I think that they will kind
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
of true up their estimates um because it
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
is their last estimate payment before
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the year so it is the time
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
when they're most likely to have
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
evaluated what they've paid to date what
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
their business looks like to date and
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
maybe make a more calculated payment
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
come December um in many cases taxpayers
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
take their prior year liability divided
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
by four and make four even quarterly
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
payments and then we wouldn't see the
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
impact of that any overpayments there
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
until we get into return filing season
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
in March and April okay um I too am
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
often obviously asked about Revenue
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
estimates and I am at this point
 
01:49:40.599 --> 01:49:41.910 align:start position:0%
estimates and I am at this point
cautiously

01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
cautiously
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
optimistic um I will remind folks if you
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
haven't taken a look lately refer to our
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
um business tax triangles in our annual
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
report that's available on our
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
website what it will show you is that
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our Revenue comes
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
from a few taxpayers under 500 under 300
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're looking at it
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that this economic downturn
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
recession whatever you want to call it
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic as we know
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
is different from prior recessions that
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen but I think one of the ways
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
that it's most different is that it has
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
not impacted all businesses evenly you
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
know prior recessions with just a
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
general economic downturn all businesses
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
feel some pain as Melissa mentioned
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
earlier for every business that we have
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's feeling a large business that we
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
have that's feeling some pain we have
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
another one that has you know seen their
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
revenues explode due to covid so this is
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
not impacting all businesses the same
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
way and I think that might be one of the
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're not seeing the more
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
traditional down turn in taxes when
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're in a recession um like we've seen
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the past Lindy can I have a follow up
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
know our unemployment rates come down
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
pretty nicely actually yeah lower than
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
than most people
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated um what tells me that people
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
are working obviously there's certain
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
industries we know hotels restaurants
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
you know are still hurting uh gyms
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
things like that but um but the but the
 
01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.669 align:start position:0%
things like that but um but the but the
big

01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are generally manufacturers
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
make things that go into other other
 
01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:26.679 align:start position:0%
people's products and I haven't heard
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
any big reports
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
about uh negative reports about what's
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
going on in that sector and I think
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what you you were saying
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
as well correct that there's really no
 
01:51:40.109 --> 01:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
indication that those businesses are are
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
have slowed down um and because it
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
really it's a supply chain issue with
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
them because they a lot of our companies
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
produce stuff that goes into somebody
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
else's product down down the line
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I just haven't heard of
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
any news reports of major slowdowns we
 
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
had that in the beginning of the virus
 
01:52:01.229 --> 01:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
but I I haven't heard lately either so
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
sure and I one of the recent um graphs
 
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
I've seen about the impact of covid and
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
the potential trajectory of the economy
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
um looks more like a Nike Swoosh you
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
know you had that quick drop and a quick
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
return and then it kind of levels off
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
for a while and so I think that dip was
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
just very quick um and short short for a
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
lot of people but as you mentioned
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
certainly that's not the case for all
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to um have anybody
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
think that I don't think there are
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that are hurting because
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
certainly there are um but as I said
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
this pandemic is just not impacting
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
every business exactly the same and you
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
have the winners and losers um and for
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
every one of our large companies that
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
might be a loser there's another winner
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of looking to take their
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
place in terms of the top taxpayers so
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
we just haven't had that across the
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
board decrease in
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue thank you
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
lindsy Senator Morris has a question and
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham right and representative elme
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for inviting the Senate the um
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
I I just have a question about are these
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
numbers accounting for because this is
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
an easier format than the budget
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
presentation that's happened for the
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
last three days um to ask these
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions payroll protection money
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
accountants are are finally dealing with
 
01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
companies um in these last two months on
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
where Washington's looking at payroll
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
protection and obviously New Hampshire
 
01:53:38.069 --> 01:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
is going to tax it um has that been
 
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
accounted for in these Revenue
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
estimates that's a good question not
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
specifically I don't we don't have a
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
specific number that's an adjustment due
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the taxability of PPP or other Aid it
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
is just kind of generally accounting for
 
01:53:59.069 --> 01:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in um in the broader
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
economy and in the estimates to date so
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think without PPP other federal aid
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
other state aid we would see a decrease
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
in estimates that businesses are paying
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
um they'd be feeling the pain of the
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic potentially more in certain
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
cases and so with that Aid I think
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's helped bolster their estimates
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
and keep them at the levels that they
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
are at so we haven't felt the need to
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
make a specific adjustment
 
01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.709 align:start position:0%
make a specific adjustment
further

01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
question is there commissioner is there
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
anyone that tracked the money that came
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
in well I mean we know what the number
 
01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
is but is there anyone that's working
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
with all these businesses that we can
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
look at this because I I I think it's
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
significant to be honest with you um in
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the fact that most people were
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
being advised not to take forgiveness
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
and till later this fall um at an
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
application process and now they're
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
finding out um that you know no matter
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
what there it's going to be considered a
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
grant and uh I mean I might be
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
overstating that but um the uh in any
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
case I think it's a huge revenue for the
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
but the other thing I would note there
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
is that um it will be included in you
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
know gross income um but to the extent
 
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
that the PPP money for instance was
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
spent on expenses that are generally
 
01:55:32.189 --> 01:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
deductible so you know ordinary business
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
expenses that are deductible those will
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
be able to be deducted as well and so
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
the net impact in that situation you
 
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
know if I got a
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
$100 gonna go into my income but if I
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
spent that $100 on a deductible expense
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
you know the net is essentially zero but
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
if I received that $100 and didn't spend
 
01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
it and instead invested it or just put
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
it in my pocket for the next rainy day
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
then the taxx then that $100 would be
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
taxable so it's really a business by
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
business um decision and as you
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned with kind of the changing
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
Federal guidance it's been hard for us
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
to really kind of get a handle on what
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are actually doing but we do
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
have some great relationships with
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
accountants and tax preparers and so we
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
can certainly reach out um to get a
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
sense of what they're hearing from their
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
clients yeah commissioner I just think
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
the $500,000 limits going to be hit by a
 
01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
lot of small businesses this year which
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
means they're probably spending it in
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and then on so it's
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a multiplier effect and then
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
on top of all the news that's coming out
 
01:56:38.599 --> 01:56:39.310 align:start position:0%
on top of all the news that's coming out
of

01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
Washington um you know you're going to
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
see yearend bonuses that are going to
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
get accounted for so um I just anyhow I
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a presentation on
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
that in Jan January because I think it
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
sure and we also have a question from
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah I actually
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
was uh going to address the same issue
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
on PPP I think there's 380 billion in
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
ppps that were uh sent to uh New
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and who knows maybe
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
some uh other businesses that have a
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
portion of their business in New
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but at at regular tax rates
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
since a good part of the question has
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
been answered um uh you know assum
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
assuming that it doesn't lead to new new
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh that could be 25 billion
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
in um uh additional uh business profits
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
tax or bet Revenue uh in the state kind
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
of kind of that's the top end uh
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
ignoring any stimulus effects of the PPP
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh loans uh and and uh soon to be grants
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
and um um so I was somewhat surprised
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
that most of the increase is
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
attributable to the few large taxpayers
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
and um was wondering if you thought the
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
PPP part was probably going to be part
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the true up uh that is going on and
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
and um then you already answered the
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
question was whether there was any um a
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
direct effort to account for pppp and in
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh change Revenue uh business tax
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates thanks I think you
 
01:58:25.069 --> 01:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
bring up a good point my mind because we
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
originally estimated business tax
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
revenues to be much lower than where
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
they are now my mind for the December
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
estimates if they are in fact a true up
 
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
would be a reduction but you make a good
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
point that given the additional Guidance
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
with PPP the true up may be in a in the
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
positive direction as well um so back to
 
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:45.639 align:start position:0%
representative aram's point I won't say
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's the last time I say that we're
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
looking forward to data from next month
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
but we're looking forward to data from
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
next month um to see where revenues will
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
come in and that will help uh help us
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
go thank you I don't see any other
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions at the moment I did want to
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
ask do you have any uh thoughts on what
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
will happen if we don't get another um
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
fairly large federal government stimulus
 
01:59:18.510 --> 01:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
package and the businesses don't get
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
um we noted the potential for another
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
stimulus package here as one of the
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
factors to consider um although how
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
revenues have been performing to date um
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
given that there is was EXs PPP funds um
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
we have had a number of businesses and I
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
was going to talk about this in a minut
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
minute um asking about returning their
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
main street or self- Grant because they
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
in turn figured out towards the end of
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
the year that they don't need the money
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I I personally don't believe a lack
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
of a stimulus package um will have a
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
dramatic impact on revenues um at this
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
point in time obviously I think that
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
partially depends on what happens going
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
into the winter how long this second
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
wave lasts and any additional um
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions that we see placed on the
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
economy um but if it's just kind of
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
status quo for today I'm sure that um
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
the stimulus package another stimulus
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
package would be incredibly helpful um
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
but I think we just kind of have it as
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
an unknown in our Revenue estimates at
 
02:00:36.599 --> 02:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
an unknown in our Revenue estimates at
this

02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
point so you're I think assuming no no
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
such stimulus package we're assuming no
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
because there is not one um that has
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
been passed today but it is as Melissa
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned something that that we are
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about but without a specific
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
package it's tough for us to um account
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
for that specifically in our
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
you okay so there are no other questions
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
on business taxes I'll just put up the
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
summary of where we land looking at our
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
large taxes at the end of the day um if
 
02:01:22.270 --> 02:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
you combine all the lows low estimates
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
versus plan would be 56.3 million below
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
plan at the end of fiscal year 21 if you
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
take all of our high estimates you'd be
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
15.9 million ahead of plan at the end of
 
02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year so this is um a bit of a
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
larger range um but obviously there's a
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
lot of unknowns um but hopefully we've
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
explained thoroughly today um how we
 
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
came up with the ranges um and informed
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
folks to maybe make your own decisions
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
about where you think we might land
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.350 --> 02:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
ranges if there are no other questions I
 
02:02:00.270 --> 02:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
would just like to take a moment to do a
 
02:02:03.390 --> 02:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Dr plug um since it's
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
been a while since we've spoken with all
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
of you we've obviously been quite busy
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
over the last few months um so covid as
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
you can imagine for all of us kind of
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
came out of nowhere um to a little bit
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
of an extent we transitioned a large
 
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
portion of our staff to working from
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
home we have approxim two-thirds of our
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
staff that are at home and remain at
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
home although as Melissa mentioned we
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
have resumed audit and collection
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
activities while kind of keeping an eye
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
to what's going on with the pandemic and
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
the impact on
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um since March there's really
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
um a few large things that happened here
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
at Dr the first that I want to mention
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
is we administered both the Main Street
 
02:02:47.229 --> 02:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
Relief Fund and the self-employed
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
livelihood fund so we shifted from
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
collecting money to handing money out
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the staff did a great job here making
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
that a pretty seamless transition I'm
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
really proud of the amount of money um
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we were able to hand out between
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
those two programs and I know I engaged
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
with some of you who had some
 
02:03:08.189 --> 02:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
constituent issues during the time um
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
that we were doing that so that was a
 
02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
large undertaking and we were doing that
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
at the same time we were going live with
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
our second phase of rims most of you are
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with rims our Revenue
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
information management system which is
 
02:03:24.069 --> 02:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
our roughly 30 million new technology
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
system our first roll out went live last
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
fall with the meals and rentals tax
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility quality assessment and
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid enhancement tax and we
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually went live on time um with roll
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
out 2 at the beginning of October which
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
includes the business taxes the interest
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax and the communication
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
Services tax so that was going to be a
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
big deal regardless of the pandemic and
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that we were all working from
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
home um but it was even bigger deal
 
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
because we were able to pull it off um
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
seamlessly the roll out has been very
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
successful we're really excited for it
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
um we've received great feedback from
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals in terms of
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
utilizing our Granite tax connect
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
portal um and we're already full steam
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
ahead on our third and final rollout
 
02:04:13.229 --> 02:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
which will include all of our remaining
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
taxes like the real estate transfer tax
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax Etc and that will go live at
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning of August of 2021
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
so I know it's something that we've
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot with the both of
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
these committees over the years so just
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that positive news um
 
02:04:31.709 --> 02:04:31.719 align:start position:0%
and that update and happy to answer any
 
02:04:31.719 --> 02:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
and that update and happy to answer any
other

02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I personally have
 
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
been using uh the Dr as a model example
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
for a lot of other agencies and people
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
in other states I don't think ncsl has
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
paid enough attention to you um
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
but it's been absolutely incredible how
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
well you've made the
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
transition and I don't know if you're
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
planning on on continuing to do more
 
02:05:07.549 --> 02:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
remote work after this we are we do not
 
02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
have any plans at the moment to return
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
staff into the office um as you can see
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
Melissa is working from home um I'm in
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
the office today but I kind of split my
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
time between the office and home I
 
02:05:20.189 --> 02:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
basically come in to sign some paperwork
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and things like that um folks have
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
transitioned very well to working from
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
home we've been very successful had a
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
lot of support from doit and we're very
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
thankful for that um and for the most
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
part most of the taxpayers are in remote
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
work situations and so you know for
 
02:05:38.549 --> 02:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
auditing purposes we're not anticipating
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
audit travel for a few more months um
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
but we've been engaging remotely um with
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers and it's been very
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
seamless so uh we had little to no
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
remote work aside from auditing prior to
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and like I said now we have
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
over two-thirds to somewhere around
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
three4 some days of Staff working from
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
home so it's been um it wasn't easy to
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
start but uh folks adapted very quickly
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
and um they've kept up with all of their
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
work at home and so for the time being I
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
think the safest place is to have most
 
02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
staff at home so that's our plan for
 
02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
staff at home so that's our plan for
going

02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
forward right commissioner Bob G with a
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
question sure hi Senator good to see you
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you for all your hard
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
work and the department and and the good
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
people working there um looking ahead do
 
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
you see this new paradigm of working at
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
home as potentially becoming a new model
 
02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:37.719 align:start position:0%
for Dr or perhaps state government um in
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
some limited or perhaps more expansive
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
capacity sure I'll speak for Dr um like
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
I said we had very little um work from
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
home um which you know obviously
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
presented its challenges on days were in
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
the winter where the roads weren't good
 
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
um or those of us that are juggling
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
young families um needing to um care for
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
young ones or elderly parents whatever
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
the case may be I think working from
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
home or the ability to work from home
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
has shown us that we can uh have a much
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
better balance of the two um balancing
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
your home with work I think morale um
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
has been positive for the most part we
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
have had a few employees that have
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
self-identified that working from home
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
is not for them um and they have asked
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
to return to the office and we have
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
allowed those folks to come back in
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
assuming that they can socially distance
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
themselves here in the office um I'm
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we can kind of do a hybrid
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
approach in the future um I miss seeing
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
Melissa every day her office is actually
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
right next to mine and now I only get to
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
see her on a computer screen so I'd like
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
to see her in person more often um but I
 
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
think now that we have the tools that we
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
have we utilize Microsoft teams quite a
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
bit um and the other collaboration tools
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we have I think going forward we
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
will have much more of a hybrid approach
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for this
 
02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:04.510 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for this
presentation

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's been very helpful and
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
reassuring uh I hope we'll continue to
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
April but it's looking it's looking
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
quite well and I hope you you can
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
distribute the the answers to the
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions that we gave you to everybody
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
on the committee the people that are
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to be leaving perhaps if they're
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
interested we can um can I can send
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
individually to the Democrats I think
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
all of the Republicans are back we have
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
one retiree and one who who lost his
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
election on
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
so um this this is looking really
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.669 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:25.750 align:start position:0%
right and aside from that I think that
that

02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're finished rep me this is Chris yes
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
um I have Lottery available to talk to
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
the committee now um we need their
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
time um and I saw the Dr was ending
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
early so Charlie was graceful enough to
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
get online and be able to talk to you
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
now okay okay um and also just to follow
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
up with if Lindsay provides the question
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
responses to me we can put on our
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
website where these documents are
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
located as well so for those that would
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
be great that may not be going forward
 
02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure and is that okay to bring Charlie
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
on board now represent Aly yes uh thank
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
you all Lindsay and Carolyn and Melissa
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much nice to see all of
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
you so for lottery we have just a single
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
page about the the distribution of the
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
money for the games uh and it's left at
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
the estimate that he provided uh at the
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year that was in our in
 
02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year that was in our in
our

02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
plan as what's likely to come in but I
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
know there will be questions on Charlie
 
02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.109 align:start position:0%
know there will be questions on Charlie
or

02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon um I think it's
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon it is now um certainly um
 
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
various portions of our business have
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
declined and various have grown um most
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
notably sports betting has increased in
 
02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
the last month certainly more than we
 
02:11:15.549 --> 02:11:15.559 align:start position:0%
had anticipated uh obviously the NL
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
being in play that matters most um one
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
area we've seen significant decline
 
02:11:23.229 --> 02:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
that's not just during the pandemic but
 
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
prior to that has been the sale of our
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
jackpot games which is Powerball Mega
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
Millions and Megabucks uh last year was
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
a very bad year for us in that area uh
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
and we had hoped that that decline was
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
limited to one year
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
certainly the sale of those products is
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
declining again this year versus last
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
year um and while in terms of gross
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
revenues it's not that significant power
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
Powerball represents for us it's most
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
our most profitable product every dollar
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
of Powerball essentially returns 41
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
cents of profit to the state so a
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
decline in that is actually more costly
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
than other areas uh and so that's why
 
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
you get the revenue estimates you do I
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
try to make this as simple as possible
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
to break it out by game type
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and as a result you know you have the
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
numbers you have now like I said sports
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
betting has increased um Kino also
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
similarly we're now averaging over
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
$800,000 a week in Kino sales which puts
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
us at the level
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
um around 8 million profitability and
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's why you have the revenue estimate
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
you do um the rest of them certainly
 
02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
with the latest transfer we're above
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
plan um significantly by more than I
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
think it's $4 million now uh but given
 
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty going forward I'm
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
hesitant to raise guidance if that makes
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
sense I
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
this is now no longer the $110 million
 
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
is no longer the middle of the road it's
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
now a conservative estimate um for your
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee and obviously the Senate
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee's um usage and certainly I
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
know I don't want you folks were
 
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
schedule for 12:30 I want to leave time
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
for questions and happy to answer any
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
you have as to any of products we
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much for that sesis
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
question represent Tucker yes uh I see
 
02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:34.559 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts is
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
considering uh making the gambling uh
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling legal this year how how
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
would that affect uh New
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it's a good question I from
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
what I my Intel says that they're going
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
to wait for next year to pass it um
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
meaning that they wouldn't pass it until
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
2021 and then the question becomes in
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
what form they pass it
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
um about 80% of our revenues on the
 
02:14:06.669 --> 02:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
mobile internet side for sports betting
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
come from New Hampshire
 
02:14:11.709 --> 02:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
citizens about 50% of our retail give or
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
take comes from New Hampshire the vast
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
majority come the the rest comes from
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or the vast majority of it
 
02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
um Seabrook
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
ER retail which is the physical location
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
of the former dog track and seab Brook
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
now called The Brook does about a
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
million four a week in retail sports
 
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
betting the majority of that comes from
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um now mind you if there's
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a different customer somebody
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
wants to go to retail sports book is a
 
02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
different customer than someone uses the
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
phone or the computer
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
um I think a large portion of that stays
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to the brook only because of the
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
environment they've created
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
as well as the likely location would be
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
the casino at Encore which is a really
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
difficult place to get to um from North
 
02:15:00.119 --> 02:15:00.830 align:start position:0%
difficult place to get to um from North
of

02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
Boston uh the brook is quite easy to get
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
to from the suburbs that line our
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
Southern Border in their North the north
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and over Georgetown
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
Rowley Boxford those wealthy communities
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
where a almost the majority of our
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue at the Rook comes in wages of
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
more so those are people walking in with
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
lots of money who are quite well off um
 
02:15:32.109 --> 02:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
betting so I wouldn't imagine it would
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
drop significantly if the mass were to
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
open it up but it depends on how they
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
implement it representative if that
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it was that big over
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
there yeah so the brook became
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative the brook became the
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
largest facility for DraftKings in us
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
right now terms of wagering activity
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's on Pace to do $50 million in
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you all any further questions
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
this I noticed that chatable gaming is
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
still down at three
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
million that's um that would include
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
some of what's at the brook wouldn't it
 
02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
or is that straight Sports beding now
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah what I suggested to you were
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
regarding Revenue with straight sports
 
02:16:54.669 --> 02:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
betting at the brook uh not Char but
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
gambling uh but although they are up
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
once again uh $3 million is a
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
conservative number for childood
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
gambling for the year they have seen an
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
uptick with the closure of Encore uh
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
that Encore um closed their tables um
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
number of months ago and hasn't reopened
 
02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:18.270 align:start position:0%
number of months ago and hasn't reopened
them

02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
oh so Charlie me I mean we got to
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
players are coming
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
back yes I I think in large measure um
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
Encore was a failed experiment um and I
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
think folks visited a lot of folks in
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire visited once or twice and
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
then haven't gone back uh even before
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic their revenues were
 
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
declining rapidly um as compared to what
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
you know they got bullied into building
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
a $2.4 billion dollar casino that really
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
would have supported a $900 million
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
Casino so I don't think they're going to
 
02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
have an easy time getting players back
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic is over they're gonna
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
have to pay for them and pay for them
 
02:18:00.429 --> 02:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
you follow up Charlie how about scratch
 
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
tickets well that's kind of steady or or
 
02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:08.309 align:start position:0%
tickets well that's kind of steady or or
that

02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
decline actually our scratch ticket
 
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
sales year-over-year are up
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
18% okay um it's and it's obviously
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
represents a not quite the majority but
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
pretty close to the majority of our
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
revenues um
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
and have been strong and that's been the
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
case across the US um for New Hampshire
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's been localized in some areas it's
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
up very much and some areas it's flat
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
like for example the Sea Coast is flat
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
um but the Lakes region is up
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
25% I would imagine that's a large
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
measure folks who are staying home and
 
02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
folks who from Massachusetts now live
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
here at least live here until the
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic is over playing
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
like we've seen the vacation areas tick
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
tick up like North Country is up
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
24% um areas like Conway and Bartlett
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
and are up significantly um just because
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
I think there are more Folks up there
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
waiting out the the
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
Good interesting what is mobile
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
internet so that is the the our mobile
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
platform where you can play Power Mega
 
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
Millions and buy e instant scratch
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
tickets uh that's been growing um
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
estimates are 10 million for this year
 
02:19:32.429 --> 02:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
last year I think we're at four million
 
02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh the state
 
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
receives the majority of the the revenue
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's 70 some odd percent
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
um and that's been a growing product a
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think Lucky for Life is
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
a Interstate game isn't it it is it's
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's a um a consortion of 21 states
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
across the US that offer that product uh
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
you can win a million you can win
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a day for life
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
um and we're in the early stages of uh
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
expanding that game it looks like next
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
fall that game will go daily whereas now
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's drawn twice a week and that should
 
02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.110 align:start position:0%
it's drawn twice a week and that should
increase

02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:27.710 align:start position:0%
increase
revenues

02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
commensurately like for example we have
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
on this U one year sheet a game called
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
Gimme Five which is a state game we
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
share with Vermont and Maine we went
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
from three drawings a week to five
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
drawings a week and saw an increase in
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
sales more than 30% so it's one of the
 
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
sort of given ways we have to increase
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
sales you know there's only three ways
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
to make money this and our business
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
right it's to sell more charge more for
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
it or spend less uh and so that's one of
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
those given for us as to you know
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
Powerball used to be a Weekly Drawing
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
now twice
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
weekly next year Powerball will go three
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
times a week uh Monday Wednesday
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
Saturday uh and so we expect that to
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
grow revenues as well uh just another
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
drawing day for folks to play so that
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's not the time between drawings
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
does that make it harder
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
to easier to get well now harder to get
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
a large Power Ball if you're drawing all
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
that often it it should have the same
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
effect I mean this past year has been um
 
02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
just been bad the jackpot is a function
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
of two numbers the amount of cash the
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
group has on hand multiplied by the bond
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
factor and as you can imagine the bond
 
02:21:49.950 --> 02:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
Factor has been abysmal because interest
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
rates are so low
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
the cash value of the jackpot is almost
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the same number as the jackpot I mean
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
the value of the jackpot so you don't
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
get these sort of eye popping numbers
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
like you we would previously uh and
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
so that's gonna have to tick up a little
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
bit to help us and a billion dollar
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
jackpot happens every so often it's like
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
a three-foot snowstorm I can't predict
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
it it just shows up and it shows
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
up so the three drawings hopefully will
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
increase the number of jackpots of
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
significance in a given year but the
 
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
massive ones are showing up when they
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
show up it's more likely that it'll
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
happen in a given year but not a
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee certainly and once we jump
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
with a billion dollar Chasm once we had
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
jackpots of a billion dollars and more
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
you know half a billion dollars doesn't
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
look so interesting anymore which is
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
remarkable but the case um and we've had
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
good luck New Hampshire's had three
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
winners of a jackpot in the last four
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
years which is statistically ludicrous
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh we had two Powerball winners and one
 
02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh we had two Powerball winners and one
me

02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
winner um and so that's helped obviously
 
02:22:56.670 --> 02:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
marketing but we're going to be running
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
up against the problem with um Powerball
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
perpetually thank you Char Senator G yes
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah good to see you thank you
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
for your presentation are there any
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
areas of gaming or games of chance that
 
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
were not currently engaged in that you
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
might anticip
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
exploiting in the future growing our
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
repertoire I mean certainly there's been
 
02:23:28.349 --> 02:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
a effort in number of years stor horse
 
02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
racing uh and there will be I know that
 
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
there's an effort again in this next
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
coming session to sort of introduce that
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
that would be the largest source of
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue going forward available um for
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
you folks to
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
you Char Pat again yep you you brought
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
up an interesting thing I never thought
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
of it about Powerball and Mega Millions
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
for instance there there's lost pots of
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
money that that money doesn't get
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
invested how does that work is it the
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
central whoever controls the money is
 
02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
investing it and how does that how much
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
how it gets invested so the large pot of
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
money doesn't happen until the jackpot
 
02:24:11.269 --> 02:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
win so like New Hampshire for example
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
twice had winners in the last four
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
years every St State hangs on to its
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
money until it's needed to go
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
someplace so when we have a winner we
 
02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
tell the winner um yeah great you won
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're G have to wait 10 days because I
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
need to get 45 States's money first and
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
that goes through a Clearing House in
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
Iowa the Multistate Lottery Association
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
Aggregates all those funds and then
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
sends them to us and that happens about
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
a week after they win uh it takes a
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
while to get that kind of money together
 
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
U so the money is kept in State uh in
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
trust in past efforts some States
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
governor not New Hampshire thankfully
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
have tried to grab that money as an IOU
 
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
essentially at the end of the fiscal
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
year to balance a budget Hampshire never
 
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
has no we don't want to do
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
that no literally it happened to West
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
Virginia once where the governor of West
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
Virginia grabbed the money in in June
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
said when the winers you know we'll pay

balance the budget but does the money
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
get invested though in a conservative
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a so we're an overnight rate we

it's also this afternoon going to be
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
hard for some people shuffling the
 
02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:00.490 align:start position:0%
papers to figure out which place we're
 
02:59:00.490 --> 02:59:03.389 align:start position:0%
papers to figure out which place we're
[Music]

02:59:03.389 --> 02:59:03.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
at represent Aly we can ask the agencies
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
to um take control of the screen and put
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
their documents up similar to what
 
02:59:14.269 --> 02:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
you yeah that would be great that be
 
02:59:15.950 --> 02:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful it really makes a tremendous
 
02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
difference to me I have
 
02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
trouble because I when I wear glasses
 
02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I printed everything out and I wrote
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
notes in it but I'm the only place in my
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
house where I can put this setup doesn't

granddaughter what
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
is well you're going to have to
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
quarantine on the way back y on the way
 
03:00:52.429 --> 03:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
back what is her name Elizabeth
 
03:00:54.030 --> 03:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth very nice and what are they
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
calling her Elizabeth so far
 
03:00:59.790 --> 03:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
y there are a lot of different nicknames
 
03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
for Elizabeth that was one of my family
 
03:01:05.229 --> 03:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
names that and Katherine which also has
 
03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of variety in it that's a great
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
name we named our our oldest daughter
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
sabriel what well that's an unusual
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
variety but she waited until the the the
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
ancestor she was named after passed away
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
so you know there's at least
 
03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:33.469 align:start position:0%
so you know there's at least
that

03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:36.389 --> 03:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
right well I think we ought to get
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
started it's several minutes past
 
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
one and
 
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:45.160 align:start position:0%

let me try
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:03.710 --> 03:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
right okay well um good afternoon
 
03:04:08.269 --> 03:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
everyone so again Steve Lavoy director
 
03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
of administration for the Department of
 
03:04:12.670 --> 03:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
Safety and uh we'll be speaking today
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
about the highway fund specifically the
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Highway fund revenues um
 
03:04:19.990 --> 03:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
just just a little bit of background um
 
03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
the department of safety collects um the
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the revenues for the
 
03:04:26.750 --> 03:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund really in two different
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
areas um one is through the DMV where
 
03:04:32.510 --> 03:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
all driver related fees from licensing
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
registrations title um as well as
 
03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
violations are all recorded um and the
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
second is through the road toll also
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
known as the gas tax um both of those
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
areas have been impacted differently by
 
03:04:46.319 --> 03:04:47.910 align:start position:0%
areas have been impacted differently by
covid-19

03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
03:04:51.389 --> 03:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
DMV revenues um have seen a slight
 
03:04:53.790 --> 03:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
impact but most of the reductions that
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is really due to timing um
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
timing because we just don't have the
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
resources to process uh all the
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
transactions um as soon as we'd like to
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
so we expect to see a lot of these
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
revenues um shift into future years um
 
03:05:12.990 --> 03:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
and into future months the the gas tax
 
03:05:14.830 --> 03:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
the road toll is where we do see a
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
significant decline in revenue and
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's because of declined um usage less
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
fuel is being used there are less cars
 
03:05:24.030 --> 03:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
on the road um and we're seeing that
 
03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
within our our revenues so um the first
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
screen you're looking at here is the
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
overall Highway fund as a whole um we'll
 
03:05:34.750 --> 03:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
go over this briefly and then move into
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
the major Revenue sources that make up
 
03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
these amounts so so Mr Lavoy I I don't
 
03:05:43.110 --> 03:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
know that you're you're scrolling down
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
all that we're seeing right now is the
 
03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
all that we're seeing right now is the
title

03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
title
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
and it's a beautiful title
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
page I wanted you to really enjoy it
 
03:06:02.229 --> 03:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
before I moved on further um how's this
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh that was better The so suspense was
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
killing me
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay so you see the highway fund Revenue
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
slide slide number two yes sir very good
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
so um as you can see in fy20 um there
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
was a decline in our Highway fund
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
revenues collected we're about 4.2% less
 
03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
than planned fy21 we're projecting to
 
03:06:30.990 --> 03:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
139.3043 less than our plan um and so as
 
03:06:36.910 --> 03:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
I had already mentioned we we're seeing
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
declines specifically in U road toll but
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
also some minor declines and estimates
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
for our DMV uh revenues
 
03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
so if we move on to the first DMV
 
03:06:53.309 --> 03:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
collection Revenue that's registrations
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
in fy20 um we collected we had an actual
 
03:06:59.469 --> 03:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
increase in registration revenues in
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
fy20 for very strong Revenue collections
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year before
 
03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
covid hit um and we carried those
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
forward through the end of the year that
 
03:07:12.030 --> 03:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
we saw a 3% increase over plan but
 
03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
fy21 um we're not expecting that same
 
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
amount we're expecting to go down to pre
 
03:07:22.590 --> 03:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh fy20 levels to fy19 relatively flat
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
$121,000 decrease um from the plan of 85
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
million uh we're projecting to collect
 
03:07:35.309 --> 03:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
5% less in fy21 than our preco levels
 
03:07:37.229 --> 03:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the year so each month
 
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
5% less than pre-co amounts um and uh
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
that that's what we're expecting for
 
03:07:42.319 --> 03:07:44.469 align:start position:0%
that that's what we're expecting for
registration

03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:07:47.070 --> 03:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
revenues for motor vehicle operators
 
03:07:49.790 --> 03:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue these are your driver licenses
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
um in fy20 uh we collected about
 
03:07:58.670 --> 03:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
$726,000 less or 5.5% less than planned
 
03:08:02.190 --> 03:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
that was a 12.6 million in fy21 we're
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
projecting to collect 8.48 million in
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue um which is uh only $42,000 less
 
03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
than planned uh this is the area there's
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
a significant decline in revenues here
 
03:08:15.790 --> 03:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
this is because of the five-year license
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
renewal period and so fy21 is our dip
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
year so we've already projected that um
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
dip into the amount um but because
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
individuals need licenses to drive they
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh we still expect to um recover those
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
revenues and again DMV is working really
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
hard to make sure that they offer enough
 
03:08:37.510 --> 03:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
appointments and opportunities for
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
customers to obtain their driver
 
03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
licenses even with the new covid
 
03:08:43.630 --> 03:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
operations that they've put into place
 
03:08:46.349 --> 03:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
um I do want to take a minute just to uh
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
let the committee know a little bit
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
about what DMV's done they've really
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
worked hard to make sure that they can
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
continue providing service throughout
 
03:08:58.030 --> 03:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
covid um they did not shut down um
 
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
operations they had to close physical um
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
appointments and and walk-in Service uh
 
03:09:06.309 --> 03:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the pandemic but
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
they've slowly been building up
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
appointment-based services for
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to come in person for those
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
transactions that they have to complete
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
in person um and they've really done a
 
03:09:18.990 --> 03:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
great job of ensuring that we're still
 
03:09:20.910 --> 03:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
collecting Revenue during this period of
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
time um a lot of other states closed
 
03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
their DMV operations um New Hampshire
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
didn't and and that's really helped us
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
out as far as maintaining revenues
 
03:09:33.389 --> 03:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
fund motor vehicle title revenue is the
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
next slide slide five in fy20 uh we
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
collected 9.5 million which is about a
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
1.7% less than planed of 9.7 for fy21
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
we're projecting to collect 9.5 again uh
 
03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
which is 2.7% less than planned and this
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
projection is assuming a 10% decrease
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
through April um and then a 5% decrease
 
03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
in May and June assuming that as we get
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
through the worst of the winter and into
 
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
the springtime hopefully if there's a
 
03:10:08.429 --> 03:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine out there people start um
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
getting some economic recovery going
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
that there might be some more um
 
03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.550 --> 03:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
happen motor vehicle inspection C
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue this is an area that's
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
relatively flat we haven't seen a lot a
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
huge impact from Co um again the laws
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
haven't been Chang you still need to
 
03:10:28.590 --> 03:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
have a motor vehicle safety inspection
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
conducted each year um and so you see
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
the revenues reflect that and fy20 we
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
collected $4 million um which was
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
288,000 more than planned and in fy21
 
03:10:43.950 --> 03:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're projecting to collect $3.8 million
 
03:10:45.229 --> 03:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
$22,000 uh more than plan which is a
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
5.6% increase um so not a lot to really
 
03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
discuss here this is an area that um
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
Co miscellaneous fees so there's a
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
couple of changes that you'll see here
 
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
the first clearly are the blue uh bars
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
which are plea by mail so in the last
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
budget um in the
 
03:11:16.710 --> 03:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
fy2 uh yeah FY 2021 budget um Bal budget
 
03:11:19.110 --> 03:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
ple by revenues were moved from the
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
general fund to the highway fund and so
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing them reflected
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
for the first time here we bu mail and
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fines um which are from
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch they're related um
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
so these are fees uh these are fines
 
03:11:35.790 --> 03:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
related to motor vehicle violations and
 
03:11:37.790 --> 03:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
an individual if you receive a ticket
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
you have an option of either paying that
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
ticket by mail cleaning by mail that
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
gets processed at the DMV and recorded
 
03:11:46.429 --> 03:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
directly into the highway fund now um or
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
you could contest that ticket in which
 
03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
case you would go to the courts and um
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
through the court process your fine
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
would either be upheld dismissed or
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
maybe reduced and those revenues are
 
03:11:59.870 --> 03:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
collected through the judicial branch so
 
03:12:03.150 --> 03:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
for fy20 um f by mail collections were
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
$5.6 million which was less than planned
 
03:12:10.750 --> 03:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh about 33.3% less in fy21 we're
 
03:12:14.190 --> 03:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
projecting $7.5 million in ple by mail
 
03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
collections Which is 10.7% less than
 
03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:18.510 align:start position:0%
collections Which is 10.7% less than
plan

03:12:18.510 --> 03:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
and then the judicial branch fines
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
through the courts we collected 4.7
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
million in fy20 which was an 11.4%
 
03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
decrease from plan and in fy21 we're
 
03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
projecting 4.3 million which is $640,000
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
of less than the plan the current plan
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
amount being 4.9 million and those are
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
amounts that we um that that we work
 
03:12:44.190 --> 03:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
with um with with the AOC on obtaining
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that we understand what the
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
court system looks like like how how are
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
they able to process especially with
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um so those are the revised
 
03:12:54.990 --> 03:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
estimates that they helped uh provide to
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
us um the big decline in in violations
 
03:13:01.469 --> 03:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
here has to do with um a decline in
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
traffic that we saw so when the when the
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic first hit um there were not as
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
many cars on the road um and um so
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
therefore there were not as many tickets
 
03:13:14.670 --> 03:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
that were written um as things started
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
to progress and more vehicles uh became
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
present we had more people coming into
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state um enforcement efforts were
 
03:13:24.429 --> 03:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
also uh increased and so there were more
 
03:13:26.349 --> 03:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
tickets that were being written uh and
 
03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's why there's an increase in
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
forward so then unrestricted road toll
 
03:13:40.110 --> 03:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
revenues um this is again this is the
 
03:13:42.190 --> 03:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
big area that I mentioned before that's
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
really been impacted by
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um so we'll go over the number
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then we can talk a little bit about
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
why we're thinking this is where we're
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to land uh in
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
fy20 you can see we collected
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
$19.8 million which is an 8% decrease
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
over plan so we're over $10 million
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
short uh from our planned amount in fy21
 
03:14:11.429 --> 03:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
we're projecting to collect $117 million
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh which is an
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
11.5% decline from the plan of
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
132 um
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
the the declines have to do with um the
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
the volume of traffic that we're seeing
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
on the roads so typically when we talk
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
about road toll um I know when I've
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
talked to this group in the past we talk
 
03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
about price we talk about weather we
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
talk about economy and so those are the
 
03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
three factors that we would consider
 
03:14:40.349 --> 03:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
When developing our our plans right now
 
03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
the price for um for gasoline is is low
 
03:14:47.790 --> 03:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
price is not really an issue
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
um we we've got
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
a199 is the average in the state you'll
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
see it lower uh in some places you'll
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
see it over $2 and others but um it's
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
$1.99 is is the average currently and um
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're expecting the price of a gallon to
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
go down before the end of the year this
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
is from the um the US Energy Information
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
Administration the eia they forecast gas
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
prices we're expected to decline across
 
03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
the US to 1.9 a193 a gallon um and then
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
in 2021 by the end of 2021 increased to
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
$217 a gallon either way those are low
 
03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
prices especially if you go back the
 
03:15:34.349 --> 03:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
last maybe five to eight years or so um
 
03:15:37.070 --> 03:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
so price is not an issue weather weather
 
03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
really hasn't been an issue for us
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
either we've had um great weather um as
 
03:15:44.469 --> 03:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
far as for travel and and for tourism
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a lot of rain there's
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
actually been as we all know there there
 
03:15:51.870 --> 03:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
was a drought across the state um so we
 
03:15:54.269 --> 03:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
had too many nice sunny days some would
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
argue um so weather was not um
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
preventing people from driving um so now
 
03:16:01.590 --> 03:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
you get to the economy and uh the
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
economy is really where um we see the
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
big hit so if we look at GDP because of
 
03:16:10.389 --> 03:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um us Bureau of economic
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
analysis uh real GDP decreased to uh by
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
31.4% in the second quarter of 2020 so
 
03:16:20.590 --> 03:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
that was a big hit and it was a big hit
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
that happened fast the um the GDP has
 
03:16:27.189 --> 03:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
Rebound in quarter three um the expected
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
rate has is an expected increase of
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
33.1% that's based on their Advanced
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
estimates so we'll see what that really
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
looks like but that's only part of the
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
story and so even if we have positive
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
price positive weather and some positive
 
03:16:45.790 --> 03:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
economic uh impacts uh we need people on
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
the roads and so one of the things that
 
03:16:50.590 --> 03:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
we look at when we project these figures
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
are DOT traffic numbers so the
 
03:16:54.510 --> 03:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation shares
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
their numbers with us um and we take a
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
look at the turnpike system um State
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
highways um the the interstates and and
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing they're seeing a decline um
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
year-over-year decline of anywhere from
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know 13 to 20% um that's been
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
fluctuating it was real bad at the
 
03:17:15.790 --> 03:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
beginning almost 50% starting to recover
 
03:17:17.469 --> 03:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
but now we've got a little bit of um
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in that recovery and that's
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
really been the struggle that we've had
 
03:17:24.030 --> 03:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
internally um and that's really the
 
03:17:26.110 --> 03:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
struggle for for for anyone projecting
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
these gas road toll revenues where will
 
03:17:32.030 --> 03:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
that Plateau happen um I was listening
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
into uh the Dr presentation um and the
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner had mentioned that um a lot
 
03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
of people are are teleworking in in her
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
office they're working from home and
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing the same thing here in
 
03:17:46.590 --> 03:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
safety and so part of that discussion is
 
03:17:49.630 --> 03:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
as Tork becomes more normalized even
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
after vaccines are administered and if
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
we're able to move Beyond covid-19 will
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
less people be commuting if less people
 
03:17:59.389 --> 03:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
are commuting then we'll expect less
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
gallonage across the state and so where
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that um where is that Gap going to be
 
03:18:07.229 --> 03:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
when we compare our road toll revenues
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
to Prior years we originally our
 
03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
projections from a few months ago we
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
expected that um decline to be at about
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
5% so we were assuming a slow and steady
 
03:18:21.550 --> 03:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
increase um from now through the winter
 
03:18:24.110 --> 03:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and eventually Landing at about 5%
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know maybe January February time
 
03:18:28.030 --> 03:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
frame moving out for the rest of the
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
year um and what we were seeing was was
 
03:18:34.349 --> 03:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
supporting that uh was supporting that
 
03:18:38.429 --> 03:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
growth um Looking Back Now on where
 
03:18:41.070 --> 03:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
where we are July
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
133% um year-over-year decline August we
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
recovered 1% we got to 12% September we
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
gained 2% we got to 10% October now
 
03:18:54.189 --> 03:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're only 6% from October's monthly
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
collections from the prior year um but
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
November preliminary numbers just came
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the gas tax we collect that on the
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
20th of each month and our preliminary
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
November collections are about 10% off
 
03:19:08.349 --> 03:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
of Prior year so we made some good gains
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
but we dropped back down to the 10%
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
range um based on all of the information
 
03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that that I just discussed um
 
03:19:19.150 --> 03:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the dot numbers looking at
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
our growth curve and um considering
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
where we think we might Plateau we moved
 
03:19:29.550 --> 03:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
that Plateau percentage up from 5% to 7%
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
and that did result in a decline in our
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
estimates for road toll to bring us down
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
to the uh 117 million which is about
 
03:19:41.070 --> 03:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
15.2 million less than our plan I have a
 
03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
question for you we are currently on on
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
road toll
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
projections I have a question for you I
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
have my hand
 
03:19:54.229 --> 03:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
up you ready yes okay so uh you you
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
named all the factors uh I was waiting
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
for you to say something about uh making
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
Exit 11 uh off of Daniel Webster um
 
03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
tollfree do do you have an idea of how
 
03:20:11.309 --> 03:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
much that decision cost the
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
state um I do not so this um the
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
revenues that we col collector for the
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
gas tax um in particular we call it the
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
road toll but the um the toll
 
03:20:24.150 --> 03:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
collections are collected by the
 
03:20:26.429 --> 03:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and so I
 
03:20:28.990 --> 03:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what that impact would
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
have okay thank
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
you um um Steve I I think around
 
03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
$600,000 was the number that we were
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
quoted for the loss of that uh that toll
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue but we could we could check it
 
03:20:51.309 --> 03:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
with the we could check it with the with
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
the Turn Pike you Senator I think that
 
03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
was that was the number and you couple
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
that with the other almost 1 million we
 
03:21:01.870 --> 03:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
losing because of the bridge and you you
 
03:21:05.550 --> 03:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
can see that uh that total revenues uh
 
03:21:10.189 --> 03:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
down represent of Edwards we do have
 
03:21:15.150 --> 03:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
someone from dot on the line and they
 
03:21:18.189 --> 03:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
could address that for you once done his
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
presentation all right I'm sorry I got
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
confused by the Dual use of the word
 
03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
toll at least I didn't think we were
 
03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
talking Tollhouse
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
cookies no it happens it happens all the
 
03:21:36.189 --> 03:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
time and um just a testament to how we
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
do not like taxes in the state of New
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but essentially it's the
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
gas tax that we're that that we're
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
talking about um so then the final slide
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
here is the highway fund Revenue detail
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
listing out all the different sources um
 
03:21:53.710 --> 03:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
comparing the plan to the projected uh
 
03:21:56.910 --> 03:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
and showing the change um so the bottom
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
line for
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
fy21 um is really what what you want to
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
be focused on here so we're projecting
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
to collect $
 
03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
to collect $
239.000

03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
239.000
 
03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
million uh which is 16.4 million um less
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
than our plan um and that's we feel that
 
03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a
 
03:22:20.189 --> 03:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate not conser not
 
03:22:22.349 --> 03:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
overly conservative reasonably
 
03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
conservative obviously if things change
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
and we have additional um additional
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
activities on the road um the road toll
 
03:22:34.349 --> 03:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
is is driving the vast majority of that
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
loss from plan um but unfortunately
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
based on all the factors that we're
 
03:22:42.429 --> 03:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
seeing um we we feel like this is this
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
is likely where we'll end at the end of
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year and um I did provide the
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
committee with a version of this uh
 
03:22:51.870 --> 03:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's not in the presentation so kind
 
03:22:53.870 --> 03:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
of as a working document um which should
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
have the same numbers and I'd be happy
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
have thank you are there any
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
questions just just one if I might Madam
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
chair yes Senator Steve when is the
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
point in time when when the uh when the
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
gasoline Royal toll income that the 4
 
03:23:21.870 --> 03:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
cents is dedicated to repaying the Tiffy
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
happen I'm sorry can you repeat the
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
question yes when the the Tiff loan that
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
we took that do took for the paving when
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
when does that repayment schedule begin
 
03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we have to take all of the revenues
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
from the 4.1 increase in the gas tax and
 
03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
from the 4.1 increase in the gas tax and
dedicated

03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the repayment of that loan
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
um Senator I don't know when that uh
 
03:23:54.790 --> 03:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
when that does start I would defer that
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
question to uh Department of
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation um I just don't I I'm not
 
03:24:02.429 --> 03:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
sure what the schedule is okay but but
 
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
Senator dandro this is Chris yeah Chris
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from do Marie Mullen is is on
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
the line so when Steve is done and you
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
have no questions related to Highway
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
fund we'll ask Maria to speak to your
 
03:24:15.630 --> 03:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
question as well as representative
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
Edward's question
 
03:24:20.189 --> 03:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
great just my my point is when you look
 
03:24:22.990 --> 03:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
at a $15 million change in
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
income unless that improves dramatically
 
03:24:29.469 --> 03:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
we're on a path that's going to take us
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.950 --> 03:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
direction understood and I think part of
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
it is um um and again I I I I'm not
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with all the ins and outs of
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
this so I would defer to dot but what
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here are the
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
unrestricted road to collections only
 
03:24:50.110 --> 03:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
not the restricted portion and I believe
 
03:24:53.189 --> 03:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
a portion of of of what you're referring
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
to is part of our restricted collections
 
03:24:59.550 --> 03:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
but i' I'd want Marie to speak more to
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
that we have Marie on the line now and
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
she's raised her hand if you'd like her
 
03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.990 --> 03:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought I was unmuted yes uh we we
 
03:25:24.670 --> 03:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
definitely need to hear from her right
 
03:25:28.590 --> 03:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
now to get this sorted out because it
 
03:25:30.910 --> 03:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like the money is coming from the
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
unrestricted to the restricted under the
 
03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
Tiffy alone okay she's on the line
 
03:25:38.830 --> 03:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
now good morning I'm Marie Mullen
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
Director of Finance for New Hampshire do
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
so Senator delandro to answer your
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
question the Tiff
 
03:25:48.630 --> 03:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
the principal payments for the tifia
 
03:25:50.670 --> 03:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
loan would begin in
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
2025 um So currently this the the loss
 
03:25:57.150 --> 03:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
and revenue we're seeing right now is
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
impacting the um the the commitment we
 
03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
made on the loan for the rural bridge
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
and pavement um betterment type
 
03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures so we've seen about one and
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
a half to $2 million decline last year
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
and we'll see a little bit of a decline
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
over what we were receiving in Revenue
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
back you know in
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
fy19 um but right now that's impacting
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
more on the betterment program and and
 
03:26:27.670 --> 03:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
the paving and Bridge
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
projects um than um the principal
 
03:26:33.670 --> 03:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
payments on the loan that will be in
 
03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:36.510 align:start position:0%
payments on the loan that will be in
2025

03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
2025
 
03:26:39.189 --> 03:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
but but there there's I mean unless
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
unless this situation improves uh
 
03:26:43.550 --> 03:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a danger sign that's
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
up there and right now it's it reflects
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
in the money that we're we're giving to
 
03:26:50.189 --> 03:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
the communities for for that that brid
 
03:26:51.389 --> 03:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
but going
 
03:26:54.309 --> 03:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
forward um unless things dramatically
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
improve and there's a couple of things
 
03:26:57.870 --> 03:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
that are happening electric vehicles and
 
03:27:00.429 --> 03:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and so forth and so on
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
we've really got to keep an eye on this
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
closely I would I would
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
think yes um I would agree we are seeing
 
03:27:11.389 --> 03:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
um changes related to fuel efficiency
 
03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that impact uh vehicle miles traveled
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the the the revenue that comes in
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
from the road toll as well um and as far
 
03:27:22.030 --> 03:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
as the tifia payments you know we are
 
03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
looking at that and looking at the
 
03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
waterfall and how those revenues um
 
03:27:30.269 --> 03:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
would impact and you know right now
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing that we have you know
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
based on future projections that we
 
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
would still have sufficient Revenue to
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
meet the principal payments and still
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
maintain the 6.8 million um state aid
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
Bridge uh program that's funded through
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is representative alme on does that
 
03:27:57.469 --> 03:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
mean we um we're going to be paying out
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance no these are restricted
 
03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
funds that the 4.2 cents that was passed
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
in 2014 those are restricted
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
specifically for the repayment of
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
principal and interest on the i93 Tiffy
 
03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
alone that was uh that we received in
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
2016 so there's money building up in
 
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
that fund that will start to be paid out
 
03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
that fund that will start to be paid out
on

03:28:28.830 --> 03:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
Capital it it's not building up it's
 
03:28:33.790 --> 03:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
actually being spent right now on
 
03:28:37.070 --> 03:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
interest um on the loan and also for the
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
betterment program there was a a
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
waterfall um for that program so in the
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
law it first 12% goes to the
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities for block grant Aid then
 
03:28:52.030 --> 03:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
any funds needed to pay interest or
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
principal then 6.8 million goes to the
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge program and anything
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
left over goes towards the betterment
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
program for Paving roads and bridges so
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
right now because we've deferred
 
03:29:05.950 --> 03:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
principal a significant portion of that
 
03:29:08.030 --> 03:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
is going towards Road and is going
 
03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
towards Paving and Bridge repairs for
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
red lless Bridges uh that we committed
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
to in the Tiffy
 
03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
alone so the funds AR necessarily
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
building up we are using those currently
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
to on Paving Bridges and um improving
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
the the roadways on our primarily our
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
rural roads in tier three and four
 
03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
pavement so in 2025 we'll start to uh
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
fall behind again on those things yes so
 
03:29:41.070 --> 03:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
in 2025 the majority of the funds will
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
be going towards paying the principal
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
and the funds that we going towards pay
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
and bridges um will not be there for
 
03:29:52.030 --> 03:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
03:29:55.870 --> 03:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you representative abrami
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
has a
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
question yeah just on the same theme so
 
03:30:02.830 --> 03:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
then the the grants that are going to
 
03:30:06.590 --> 03:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
the the individual towns the the third
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
tier is the is the towns are getting
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
certain B rant out of this aren't they I
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'm that's actually the first um
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
priority so the 12% block grant program
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
a portion in A and B that's broken out
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
based on the population and the number
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
of Lane miles and bridges each town and
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
city has in their Community that's the
 
03:30:31.950 --> 03:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
first thing that comes right off the top
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
is that 12% before even the principal
 
03:30:36.710 --> 03:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
and interest is paid so that is
 
03:30:39.870 --> 03:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
guaranteed what's the the third in line
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
is the state aid bridge program so that
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
so that's for municipally owned Bridges
 
03:30:48.910 --> 03:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
and with the current levels and what
 
03:30:50.349 --> 03:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
we're projecting in the future we
 
03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
believe that that will still be able to
 
03:30:54.189 --> 03:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
be maintained with the revenues that
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we don't think that there
 
03:30:58.110 --> 03:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
would be a reduction in that program in
 
03:31:00.269 --> 03:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
the future based on reduced revenues not
 
03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
at this point anyway so the what the
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
event in 2025 will not impact the grants
 
03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
towns no it will not yeah okay that's
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to get out thank you
 
03:31:11.680 --> 03:31:14.910 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to get out thank you
you're

03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
welcome Marie this is Chris Could you um
 
03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Edward's
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
question regarding the marac toll yeah
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
to restate that for us if I I don't
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
recall at all yeah so that was uh the
 
03:31:31.150 --> 03:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
elimination of Exit 11 the marac tolls
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that occurred in January of this year
 
03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
and um yes the senator delandro was
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
correct the the net projection was a net
 
03:31:43.150 --> 03:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
loss of $600,000 per year so that was
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars in Revenue and a
 
03:31:49.150 --> 03:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
savings of about $400,000 in operating
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
costs and maintenance so that's a net of
 
03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
costs and maintenance so that's a net of
about

03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um loss to the turnpike system
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
6,000 or 600 I'm sorry
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
600,000 and and then this is
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative Edward still uh as long
 
03:32:06.630 --> 03:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
as you're talking about different things
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
on do do you just happen to know what
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
the what the existing plan is Now with
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh exit 4A on Interstate 93 I I know
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's a spending issue but I'm just
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
curious if you know because I have
 
03:32:26.110 --> 03:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
people really concerned about what we're
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
doing with exit
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
4A I do not have that plan for you but I
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
can follow up and get that information
 
03:32:37.950 --> 03:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
um I know that the engineers and the
 
03:32:39.309 --> 03:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner they've been working with
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and with other folks to
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
determine the best um approach moving
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
forward with that so I can uh look into
 
03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
that and get you that information thank
 
03:32:59.670 --> 03:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.680 --> 03:33:01.229 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
well if are there any further questions
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the safety part of
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
this then maybe we
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
should continue onwards I don't know uh
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
Chris if you want to so you're going to
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
go over to Transportation now not
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
Transportation we're going on to
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
treasury okay and
 
03:33:29.070 --> 03:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
um we have the commissioner for the
 
03:33:32.349 --> 03:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
treasury Monica mapelli and um the
 
03:33:32.359 --> 03:33:33.269 align:start position:0%
treasury Monica mapelli and um the
Deputy

03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
Deputy
 
03:33:36.429 --> 03:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um Rachel Miller available
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
for questions Monica will be doing any
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um primary answering of questions and
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
Rachel will assist I'm going to share my
 
03:33:45.150 --> 03:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
screen with the document that came from
 
03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:46.229 align:start position:0%
screen with the document that came from
administrator

03:33:46.229 --> 03:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
services and the reason I'm sharing that
 
03:33:50.349 --> 03:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
is because that has the other revenue on
 
03:33:54.750 --> 03:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
it which includes um the revenue for
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
treasury that you're you were asking
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
about which is abandoned property and
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
then interest and um interest on on the
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
money that we have in the state if I
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
could is the uh line 29 interest surplus
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
funds the
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
treasury interest that we're talking
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
about yes so line 11 is the abandoned
 
03:34:18.030 --> 03:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
property and line 29 would include um
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
the interest that treasury would account
 
03:34:23.710 --> 03:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
for right and I believe Monica and
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
you Rachel is um connected by phone so
 
03:34:35.189 --> 03:34:35.199 align:start position:0%

03:34:35.199 --> 03:34:49.950 align:start position:0%
if you need to unmute Rachel it's star

03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:51.790 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:34:51.790 --> 03:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:34:55.349 --> 03:34:55.359 align:start position:0%

mapelli commissioner of the
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
treasury and um I don't have a a a real
 
03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
presentation for you happy to answer
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions um basically what I what I can
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
share with you today is um
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
the story is the same that I um
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
presented to you I think it was back in
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
May uh for abandoned property um
 
03:35:29.550 --> 03:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
our our estimates haven't changed for
 
03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 those remain the same
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
because we really don't know um what
 
03:35:40.030 --> 03:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
could change until um it is uh the
 
03:35:42.910 --> 03:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
spring time frame when we um when we
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
start liquidating um our security so
 
03:35:48.670 --> 03:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's when we know if our if our you
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
know how our revenue is going to be so
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
the um the unclaimed property as you may
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
recall is is property that we have we've
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
have we we have not been able to return
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
in a period of three years so it's
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
property that we have received that has
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
been reported to us and we have not been
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
able to return to the rightful owner and
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
so the only variable we we have most of
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
the pieces and our estimates are are
 
03:36:18.030 --> 03:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
based on a 10 year average so the only
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
variable in this estimate is is is as I
 
03:36:24.510 --> 03:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned as I just mentioned the the
 
03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
Securities portion is um we liqu we
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
liquidate the Securities that we receive
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
every year
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
and um when we do that it really depends
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
on how the capital markets are doing at
 
03:36:40.349 --> 03:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
that time and that's what we know if we
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
will receive what we are thinking or we
 
03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
have received
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
historically or if going to be something
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
different so in fiscal year 20
 
03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the time that we were
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
liquidating our Securities it was a time
 
03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
when the stock market wasn't wasn't
 
03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:56.670 align:start position:0%
when the stock market wasn't wasn't
doing

03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
well at this point there's really no
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
anticipation that you know we really
 
03:37:03.389 --> 03:37:03.399 align:start position:0%
don't know how that's going to be
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
performing so it will really depend on
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
how the capital markets are doing at the
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
time that we we liquidate our Securities
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
so that's really the only variable other
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
other than that it really is based on
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
historic numbers U they're pretty
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
consistent year toe and and you know
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
again if nothing really changes with the
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
stock market around that time of the
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
year February March time frame um we
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
think that those estimates um uh will be
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
good for fiscal year
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
21 thank you has there there ever been
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
do you know any consideration of uh
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
liquidating the abandoned property
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
Securities over a period time the way
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's usually done in in
 
03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:54.030 align:start position:0%
it's usually done in in
uh

03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
brokerages either buying or liquidating
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
when you've got a long-term plan yeah
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
that that is a great question I I truly
 
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
not not sure about that um the one thing
 
03:38:09.710 --> 03:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
is I know that I guess what I know is
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
that this has been the way is we do it
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a way has been that for for for some
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
time and and it really is it's very
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
difficult we try we don't we don't time
 
03:38:23.469 --> 03:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
the market so it's really difficult to
 
03:38:23.479 --> 03:38:24.500 align:start position:0%
the market so it's really difficult to
know

03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:24.510 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
know
[Music]

03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:38:27.790 --> 03:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
um you know how the market is going to
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
be performing the other piece is we do
 
03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
have to hold these Securities for a
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
period of three years so our goal is to
 
03:38:36.429 --> 03:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
return those funds and if comes to the
 
03:38:38.910 --> 03:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
time when it's time to to to say okay we
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
have not return this funds and so
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
therefore we can include them as part of
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
this cheat make calculation and that's
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
what we you know that's at the end of
 
03:38:50.349 --> 03:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
close is supposed to be closer to the
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year when we when we
 
03:38:55.070 --> 03:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
do this process of calculating what we
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
can Achi so so I think it's a
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
combination of um you know we really
 
03:39:02.710 --> 03:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
need to hold those Securities for three
 
03:39:06.150 --> 03:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
years and and and also the time that we
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
liquidate those funds but I guess what I
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
can do is is just to try to find out a
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
little more if if if something like that
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
has been considered the F I just don't
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
have that history um with
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
me I'll try to find out even if it was
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
just over a month it would probably
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
smooth this out a fair
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
amount because also the people that
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
you're returning funds to that you find
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
will get less if we happen to hit the
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
wrong day in the stock
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
market it's true more it's true but
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately like I said it's it's very
 
03:39:45.389 --> 03:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
difficult um since this is just the
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
timing of when those are those
 
03:39:48.910 --> 03:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
Securities are liquidated time in the
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
market it it would be just uh you know
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
for this for this um for this exercise
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
it will be a difficult um consideration
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
but I know all states do consider that I
 
03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
I believe maybe Massachusetts waits like
 
03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the last recession I believe they
 
03:40:06.910 --> 03:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
waited and didn't sell but that would
 
03:40:08.910 --> 03:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
really confuse the calculation for you
 
03:40:11.309 --> 03:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
know future years so we we thought about
 
03:40:13.630 --> 03:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
it actually in in in the spring we
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
thought about about holding it and we
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
decided not to we just kept uh we
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
decided to continue with um you know the
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
way it has been done in the
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
past right
 
03:40:31.110 --> 03:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
well spreading it over four
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
weeks is the safest way of avoiding
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
timing if you're trying to stabilize it
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
a little but oh absolutely so this this
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
what happens as we begin liquidating
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
Securities I think we start in February
 
03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:46.349 align:start position:0%
Securities I think we start in February
March

03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
March
 
03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
in but it does take a few months so it's
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
not a process of one day or two it
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
really is is a process of several months
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
that this funds have being liquidated so
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
so it's you're right you're right it's
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not one day it is just
 
03:41:03.309 --> 03:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
a bad timing it is a period of
 
03:41:05.469 --> 03:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
question sure unmute unmute yourself
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
thankk you for that um so when I look at
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
the chart there's two big numbers I mean
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
the 3.2 million and then down the bottom
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
the 4.8
 
03:41:28.030 --> 03:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
million uh so let's talk with about the
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
postretirement U maybe I missed what you
 
03:41:32.670 --> 03:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
said something about that why is that
 
03:41:32.680 --> 03:41:33.750 align:start position:0%
said something about that why is that
being

03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
912 yeah post re thank you is their
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
right this is that is not uh I believe
 
03:41:46.990 --> 03:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's the ministerial services that uh
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer that question the
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
the only Revenue that we oversee in this
 
03:41:55.469 --> 03:41:55.479 align:start position:0%
in this chart is uh the abandoned
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
property is cheat and and the interest
 
03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
and surplus funds all right right right
 
03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
and surplus funds all right right right
okay

03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
right but you could answer that same
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
question for the interest and surplus F
 
03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
funds it looks like you expect zero
 
03:42:15.309 --> 03:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue in this year
 
03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh you know
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um I think I do have
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
better news
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
for definitely better news for abandoned
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
property uh for the interest um Revenue
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
we we do not anticipate Revenue um or
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
very little at the end of fiscal year 21
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
and the primary reason is uh the zero
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
interest rate environment um this this
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
zero uh zero interest rate environment
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
is is expected to Prevail until at least
 
03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
Fisco year 23 it is just one you know
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces that you know while
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
trying to um help the economy um you
 
03:42:58.870 --> 03:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
know this is really the the folks that
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
we would like you know we would like to
 
03:43:03.710 --> 03:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
earn some interest um that is the um you
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
know disadvantage of of this process
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
so one of you know the interest that we
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
will re so it depends on the interest
 
03:43:14.349 --> 03:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
rate environment and it also depends on
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
the the C cash balances that we have or
 
03:43:16.960 --> 03:43:18.269 align:start position:0%
the the C cash balances that we have or
cash

03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
cash
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
position which also depends on the
 
03:43:22.950 --> 03:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
revenue performance so as we
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
are uh you know we're we're monitoring
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
our cash position and and clearly those
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
levels of of decline um during the last
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
year we we began fiscal year 29 and and
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
20 with robust robust cash balances but
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
that obviously as the revenue has
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
declined you
 
03:43:44.910 --> 03:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
know actually Revenue has performed
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
better than anticipated but um we do see
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know it it is not the way it was
 
03:43:53.750 --> 03:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
performing in fiscal year 19 and in the
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
beginning of fiscal year 20 and again
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
those that that end those earnings are
 
03:44:00.189 --> 03:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
based on those you know those cash
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
balances so we seeing our cash levels
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
and anticipating that those cash levels
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
will decline over time we do not
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate the
 
03:44:12.910 --> 03:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
interest if we have any interest um
 
03:44:14.910 --> 03:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
there are two two two pieces that you
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
know we we essentially hope to c one is
 
03:44:20.910 --> 03:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
to cover the uh the banking cost we hope
 
03:44:22.590 --> 03:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
to earn enough interest to cover the
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
banking cost and the other one is if
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
there's any interest left uh there are
 
03:44:29.830 --> 03:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
some dedicated funds that the dedicated
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds are entitled to interest we
 
03:44:34.990 --> 03:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
receive some of that and and you know
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
after doing all that math it it is
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
unlikely that we will have un restricted
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue um we will have interest in this
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
lines so that's really the story for for
 
03:44:53.950 --> 03:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue thank
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
you I believe we hit that point once in
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession too for about a year
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
or so maybe
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
more that is correct and I believe uh in
 
03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:08.030 align:start position:0%
more that is correct and I believe uh in
the

03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:45:12.189 --> 03:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
past interest was not uh budgeted and I
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
think maybe uh we began bud in in the
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
last maybe last bium or maybe a little
 
03:45:21.670 --> 03:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the one before
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
last just because of that because the
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
interest rate environment was low for
 
03:45:27.790 --> 03:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
some time and it's it was
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
just it was just not something that you
 
03:45:31.950 --> 03:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
know to be
 
03:45:34.550 --> 03:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
conservative that number was not being
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
considered um in you know as part of
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
under Revenue so this year um so fiscal
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
year 21 unfortunately we reduced that
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that estimate based on
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we know right now and for fiscal
 
03:45:50.550 --> 03:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
year 22 and 23 we're not budgeting
 
03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
interest okay and that's and that's
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
really the story so I'll be happy to
 
03:46:00.189 --> 03:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
answer you know any other question you
 
03:46:00.199 --> 03:46:00.990 align:start position:0%
answer you know any other question you
may

03:46:00.990 --> 03:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
have are there any other questions for
 
03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:05.189 align:start position:0%
have are there any other questions for
the

03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
treasury I'd like to ask CHR Pat I'd
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
like I'd like to ask Chris a question on
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
that but we we don't want to hold her up
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
but yeah maybe he knows the answer to
 
03:46:16.510 --> 03:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
number 12 the line number 12 on the
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
postretirement or do we need to talk to
 
03:46:21.149 --> 03:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
Charlie Arling house about that I think
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
we would need to reach out to admin
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
service why that number is adjusted I
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
can do that and then provide that to the
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee after the fact yeah but I
 
03:46:30.990 --> 03:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we need a full session with
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie but but because that that's a
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
big Del I was just curious about that
 
03:46:38.990 --> 03:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
one yeah no I'll I'll um send a question
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
over to administrative services to ask
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
why that went down and and then I'll
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
provide the response back to the um
 
03:46:47.229 --> 03:46:47.239 align:start position:0%

03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
Norma okay am I now on are yes okay I
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
know good afternoon
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh for the insurance revenues we
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
had originally projected
 
03:49:23.120 --> 03:49:24.830 align:start position:0%
had originally projected
$13.9

03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
$13.9
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
million we adjusted that back in the end
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
of May to reflect the changes that
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
impacted from
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
the T paybacks and the workers comp and
 
03:49:43.229 --> 03:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
also from the shift of the healthc Care
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
premium from the Marketplace to the
 
03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Health
 
03:49:50.439 --> 03:49:52.550 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Health
Plan

03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
Plan
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
so those factors are still in play for
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
what our projections are we have
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
realized a $2
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
million uh favorable variance in our fee
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
revenue and that's comprised of the fees
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
agents producers the sellers of the
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and adjusters
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
licenses there were over uh
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
13,000 new adjusters and producers and I
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
think that that Revenue was primarily a
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
timing difference that they were got
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
licensed earlier on in the year as
 
03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
compared to previous years
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe that going through
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of the fiscal year that that $2
 
03:50:56.590 --> 03:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
million will you know be in excess I
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
think that that amount will be uh
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
absorbed in the renewals and we'll still
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
be at the uh fees originally projected
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
at uh 18 million as we uh updated in May
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
so and and on the current side of things
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
the uh Property and Casualty
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
actuary he looked at the numbers and we
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
did some slight adjustments but they
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
were not Material the factors that he
 
03:51:35.110 --> 03:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
did bring into the conversation was the
 
03:51:38.349 --> 03:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
homeowners and commercial rates are
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
rising the increase in homeowners is
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
combined with increases of property
 
03:51:44.239 --> 03:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
combined with increases of property
value

03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
value
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
vales and and some of those increases
 
03:51:52.149 --> 03:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
are Revenue similar to before the
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
recession at this time the question was
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the wildfires in flooding that
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
has been uh occurring in other
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
states uh we do not believe that any of
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
that will have a noticeable impact on
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire market now obviously
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
if we do experience some
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
flooding that that kind of changes how
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
things will go
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
but it will be won't occur until the
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
2021 so that wouldn't impact until
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:39.429 --> 03:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
2022 could I ask about that one on I was
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
under the impression that being
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance that the companies were
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
spreading the risk over at least entire
 
03:52:50.110 --> 03:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
countries they aren't they're doing it
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
state by
 
03:52:54.750 --> 03:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
state that's probably a commissioner's
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
answer uh I certainly there are a lot of
 
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
national players uh Super Regional uh
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
and National players make up the vast
 
03:53:05.630 --> 03:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
majority of the market but the taxes uh
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
that they're paying for insurance
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
premium tax are net premium levels and
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
not profit levels so even
 
03:53:18.149 --> 03:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
um even in years where there are higher
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
losses or combined ratios uh the premium
 
03:53:24.670 --> 03:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
tax calculation will be the same what we
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
tend to see is uh in subsequent years of
 
03:53:31.469 --> 03:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
big catastrophic losses um we tend to
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
see companies limit their risks in
 
03:53:36.189 --> 03:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
certain marketplaces which then drives
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
potentially will drive rates up less
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
competition um but I don't think for our
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue estimates they'll be impacted
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.950 --> 03:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
losses so they don't raise the premiums
 
03:53:53.960 --> 03:53:55.590 align:start position:0%
losses so they don't raise the premiums
for

03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
everybody they only do it in the market
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
where the disaster
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
occurred I think there is some premium
 
03:54:07.229 --> 03:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
impact when there are big losses that
 
03:54:10.030 --> 03:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
everybody feels but these companies are
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and what they try to do is
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
they try to spread out their risk so
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
if if they have uh Too much exposure on
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
the coast or Too much exposure in
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
wildfires you may see them uh become
 
03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
more competitive in other markets where
 
03:54:29.630 --> 03:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
they think it balances out the risk um
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
and less competitive or withdraw from
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
markets where they're uh where they have
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
risk thank you thank
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's all changing too yeah
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
the okay and as far as the uh
 
03:54:55.199 --> 03:54:57.149 align:start position:0%
the okay and as far as the uh
Health

03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
Health
 
03:55:00.189 --> 03:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
premiums the obviously we a number of
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
uncertainties going in into the the 2021
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
calendar year because again our revenue
 
03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2021 is based off of the
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
premiums paid paid for calendar year
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
2020 and we're just about at the end of
 
03:55:21.870 --> 03:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
that so
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
the new premiums that have been approved
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
for calendar year
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
2021 actually impact fiscal year
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
2022 and as part of that they there were
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh some decreases in the the premium for
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there are obviously
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
other during 2020 many of the insurance
 
03:55:50.149 --> 03:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
companies provided some kind of Premium
 
03:55:54.349 --> 03:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
relief or some kind of a cost
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
sharing and we also saw movement from
 
03:56:03.550 --> 03:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
the U General market the employers paid
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
coverage to the Granite State Advantage
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
plan and also the the standard Medica
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
aid but at this time
 
03:56:20.149 --> 03:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
we still feel that the 128. two million
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.159 --> 03:56:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
2021

03:56:26.950 --> 03:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
2021
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the information
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
time are there any questions
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
or when when the insurers provide
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
premium relief provided uh or waved C
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
cost sharing I don't think that one
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
would reduce the premium tax but what
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
would providing premium relief after
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
they've put out the policy in charge the
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
tax yes that it
 
03:57:11.309 --> 03:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
should but again what ends up happening
 
03:57:14.349 --> 03:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
is some of the people on the individual
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
basis they may take a higher
 
03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:20.670 align:start position:0%
basis they may take a higher
deductible

03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
03:57:25.950 --> 03:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
policy but again we're at the end I I
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
believe there was some uh shift between
 
03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:32.110 align:start position:0%
believe there was some uh shift between
the

03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
employers coverage and individuals that
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
may have gone onto uh other coverage
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
whether it was Cobra whether it was the
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
individual Market that they obtained
 
03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:48.670 align:start position:0%
individual Market that they obtained
coverage

03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
in just to follow up on that
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative um we in the spring we
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
saw a number of Auto insurers offer
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
premium rebates to uh to their insurance
 
03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
because they weren't driving there were
 
03:58:04.349 --> 03:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
there were less claims um there there
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be a modest impact um potentially
 
03:58:11.149 --> 03:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
to premium tax collections based on that
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
um but with the status of the market and
 
03:58:17.309 --> 03:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
with the uh modest rate increases we're
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
seeing overall We Believe those are
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to offset and that there isn't an
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
warranted thank
 
03:58:41.910 --> 03:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:58:47.309 --> 03:58:47.319 align:start position:0%

update thank you on the presentation on

page two we've provided our year-to-date
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue at of October 31st where our
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
plan was 42.2 million and the actual
 
04:00:22.630 --> 04:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund at 46.6
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.630 --> 04:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
10.4% our total revenue for year to date
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
is 58.1 million and we've transferred
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
11.5 million to the alcohol abuse or to
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
granted advantage and that's how we come
 
04:00:43.389 --> 04:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
up with the 46.6 million that's been
 
04:00:43.399 --> 04:00:45.389 align:start position:0%
up with the 46.6 million that's been
transferred

04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
our total revenue the 58.1 is actually
 
04:00:53.149 --> 04:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
8.3% or $9 million over prior year and
 
04:00:55.630 --> 04:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
the transfer to granted Advantage is $9
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
million or 360% more than we transferred
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
last year what's not on this slide that
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't provide is um the transfer for
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
beer tax which is projected to be about
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
13 million in line to what we did last
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
three sorry oh and um we're projecting
 
04:01:22.990 --> 04:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
to transfer another 7 million doll to
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage but I'll go over
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:31.830 --> 04:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
slide so on on page three we have our
 
04:01:31.840 --> 04:01:33.550 align:start position:0%

year-to-date
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
sales okay our year-to-date sales uh uh
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
from through November 15 2020 our total
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
sales are up over last year 2.
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
9% or $9 million and the total gross
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
profit from sales over last year is 4.1%
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%

currently through
 
04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
currently through
1122

04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
1122
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
2020 we're up 3.4 4% right at this point
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
or just a little over $1 million
 
04:03:23.830 --> 04:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
11206 to be
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
exact you okay so on slide four we're
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
providing a income statement for fiscal
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
year 2019 to 21 so that you could see um
 
04:03:37.990 --> 04:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
how the it all flows through and at the
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
Top If you look on column B on line one
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
you have our total sales which we're
 
04:03:48.750 --> 04:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
projecting to be up 23.8 million or
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
3.1% if you go to row N I mean sorry Row
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
three our net sales are going to be up
 
04:04:00.750 --> 04:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
33.9 million or
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
4.6% on row five you have our gross
 
04:04:07.309 --> 04:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
profit from
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
sales I know it's echoing um we're
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
5.5% on line nine is our net liquor
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
profit which is our total revenue we're
 
04:04:24.000 --> 04:04:26.910 align:start position:0%
profit which is our total revenue we're
projecting

04:04:26.910 --> 04:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
146.940 million or
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
3.4% in our original plan we had the
 
04:04:36.510 --> 04:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
transfer to granted Advantage based on
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
17616 which was the 5% that needs to be
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
transferred based on prior years gross
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
profit So based on that plan number we
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
would actually be at
 
04:04:54.269 --> 04:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
136.6 million or almost 5 million over
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
um prior year this would have us about
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
$3 million over our plan however based
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
on RSA 126
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
aa3 we granted Advantage can request
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
additional funds based on their
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
shortfall and right now they're ejecting
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
it needing an additional 8.5 million and
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would have our liquor transfer to
 
04:05:22.110 --> 04:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
the general fund at
 
04:05:22.120 --> 04:05:27.389 align:start position:0%
the general fund at
a8.4

04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
million so that we're right now we're
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
projecting to come in at the
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
128.3 million with beer tax around 13.1
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
million and we'd be happy to answer any
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%

down there 8.5 million yep yep yep yeah
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%

okay repres I do wish that budget that
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
the budget committee the finance
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
committees would put these things in the
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
budget and in the fiscal committee
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
instead of in
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
revenues thank
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Edwards has
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
a question yeah it's more of a comment I
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
just want to congratulate you if that's
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
all right uh on line five being healthy
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
relative to line one it shows it seems
 
04:06:38.110 --> 04:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
to indicate that you guys have some
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in your operations where
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're making U Better profits so thank
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking care of our
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers well one factor in that too is
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
that this year we didn't do the uh
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
promotions where you spend $150 and you
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
get the $25 gift card um based on the
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
current sales and the market and the
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
trends uh we didn't feel that we needed
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
to run those
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
promos brings in a lot of out of state
 
04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
traffic as well so we thought it would
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
be something at least for the past year
 
04:07:14.110 --> 04:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic that we wouldn't run
 
04:07:16.269 --> 04:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at whether we'll need
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
to run them in the upcoming fiscal year
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
or not depending on what happens across
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
Market I'm I'm going to congratulate you
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%

able to analyze the market and and
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%

04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
profit there that we that we do tend to
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%

from the outside world and uh that has
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
to be recognized the the amount of

it it's it's a it's a highly competitive
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
environment the number the numbers are

are good uh the transfer I think is very
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
important because on the one hand we're
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%

04:10:17.109 --> 04:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
location next to Market Basket will be
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to around a 12,000 square foot
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
location there so unfortunately uh some
 
04:10:26.189 --> 04:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
of the smaller stores had to close and
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's mainly because uh not not only
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
because of the covid but because they
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't fit the model the brand is such
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
that when you draw people here from out
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
of state they're expecting to see the 13
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
or 14,000 SKS that we carry and
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of those smaller
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
older stores that were kind of swept up
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic don't allow that to
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
happen but these new stores will allow
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
it to happen and we'll continue to see
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
that any luck in uh finding a location
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
around the stratum area the ex location
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
or zest long going well we've looked in
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
Greenland uh We've looked at a couple of
 
04:11:14.109 --> 04:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
locations in exitor uh but nothing that
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have a letter of intent in that
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
area yet but we're continuing to look
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
because we recognized how important that
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
area is and as you know we did have a a
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
signed lease deal there that
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh we weren't able to ex
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
exercise because of uh some of the
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
restraints from the town of stratum and
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
that was really unfortunate situation
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
for us because that store would be open
 
04:11:40.030 --> 04:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
now if it could be but we haven't given
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
up the fight and we'll continue to look
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know I've been trying to help as
 
04:11:45.550 --> 04:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
much as I can on my end on that
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
one I've been trying to thank you all
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
Town fathers about this one but you
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
don't okay thank
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
you thanks for thanks for helping us out
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
and and thanks for the you know the back
 
04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
and forth with us on the phone and with
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
the town is always helpful we we try our
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
best to be uh good part business
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
partners wherever we go and it's just
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
there was an unfortunate
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
situation okay I have to stand 100%
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
don't worry
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we appreciate
 
04:12:22.349 --> 04:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
it okay could we get an update on how I
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
think it's called total Spirits is doing
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
I heard some rumor that they
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
were failing a
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
little uh Total Wine in Massachusetts
 
04:12:36.910 --> 04:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah they've uh what they've gone to is
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
they've changed their marketing plans
 
04:12:43.229 --> 04:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
originally when they came in they they
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
marketed a lot of lost leader National
 
04:12:48.670 --> 04:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
Brands and uh I've had this discussion
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
with Senator delandro quite frequently
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
they've gone on to marketing uh mainly
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
their own Brands their private label
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
Brands so you'll see a lot of marketing
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
that they do in the state now is not
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
comp not competing with us because
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
they're brands that they exclusively
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
carry and we're uh we're fine with that
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if they want to advertise
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
what I would consider off brands or
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
non-name brands that are their own to
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
get folks into their stores that's of
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
little or no consequence to us because
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
when the consumers look at their ads
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's not products that they
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
recognize it's the knockoff brands that
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
they're famous for so um we feel that
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually helped us in our
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
crossborder because you know we're a
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
national brand retailer so that's what
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
we do we don't we don't play in that
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
market it's a it's a highly profitable
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
Market but it's a it's a very volatile
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
Market as well so you're actually
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
flipping people in your stores to to off
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
Brands and uh you know most consumers
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
will try it once but they don't come
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.870 --> 04:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions
 
04:14:20.109 --> 04:14:20.119 align:start position:0%

04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%

civil litigator um we have uh we I work
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
closely with the Consumer Protection
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau um that that the Consumer
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau takes in most of the
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
um contacts that that uh reach out to us
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
um from the business Community from
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
individuals um and so I work closely
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
with the team down there um we have
 
04:16:22.590 --> 04:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
others in the uh in the Civil Bureau
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
that also work on this issue um both on
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
the litigation side and from the client
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
counseling side because we do work with
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
with Revenue we work with um with with
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh members of the business Community as
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
well and Bea and so we have um we have a
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
a team here though though I'm the I
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm the face of it um in terms of
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
quick overview um we still have not
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
received a notice under chapter 78e from
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
another state um that is something that
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
we have been trying to find creative
 
04:16:50.790 --> 04:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
ways to encourage states to do um and
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
and we have not been successful yet um
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
our our understanding is that the number
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
of states that are reaching out directly
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
to remote cellers in New Hampshire is
 
04:17:02.109 --> 04:17:02.119 align:start position:0%
still relatively small we have concerns
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
that with budget crunches in other
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
states um that's going to change and
 
04:17:08.349 --> 04:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
we're closely monitoring to to make sure
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
that that if there is any uptick um that
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we are focusing on what states are
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
doing that we are analyzing the laws of
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
the states that are reaching out to New
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and doing um
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
everything we can to ensure that they
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
comport with the with the state and
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
federal constitutions and with our laws
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
requirements um I have received a small
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
number of communications over the last
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
year um from businesses um and from
 
04:17:33.790 --> 04:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
individuals um very few of them have
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
been um about direct contacts from other
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
states I think we've had one or two um
 
04:17:41.309 --> 04:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
just in the last year um on top of a a
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
small number um during the first first
 
04:17:45.790 --> 04:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
six months the law was in effect um I
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
have received a number of communications
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
from businesses that are trying to
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
comply with other states laws trying to
 
04:17:53.469 --> 04:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
do it um preemptively um and and we
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
can't provide those businesses with
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
legal advice but um it is very useful to
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
know um who is doing that um what states
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
they are trying to comply with um it
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
gives us a more of a holistic picture of
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
what's going on out there um and I do
 
04:18:07.950 --> 04:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I try to encourage
 
04:18:09.630 --> 04:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
any business that that is going down
 
04:18:12.109 --> 04:18:12.119 align:start position:0%
that road to reach out um I've also
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
received a number of calls from from
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
individuals um with questions related to
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when they're purchasing thing
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
on things on Amazon or or or otherwise
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
why they're being charged um sales tax
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
now um because that's a change that many
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
of the big uh facilitators like Amazon
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
have put into place when sales are going
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
to states that have sales of use taxes
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
um we can't again provide tax or or
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
legal advice but that is helpful once
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
more to to kind of paint a more complete
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
picture of what's happening within the
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
state um for for those of you um who are
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
either aware or not aware of the Wayfair
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
decision um some open questions that
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
were left uh in that case were what sort
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
of connect connection a seller needed to
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
have with with a sales tax state um in
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
order to be subject to collection
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
efforts um and uh the Supreme Court
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
didn't answer that question they said
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
physical presence wasn't necessary but
 
04:19:04.349 --> 04:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
kind of left open what sort of um Nexus
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
in legal terms is is just you know
 
04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
connection is necessary um and and
 
04:19:12.109 --> 04:19:12.119 align:start position:0%
suggested that South Dakota's law maybe
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
maybe probably was okay but they didn't
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
definitively rule on that South Dakota
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
had a few features um including a
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um threshold for sales amounts
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
200 or 200 um transactions they were a
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
member of the um streamlined Sales Tax
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
Group um and they had um uh they do not
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
apply their law retroactively and the
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the majority opinion
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
suggested those are good features those
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
are things that that we we like about
 
04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
this law but never said they're
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
necessary never said they're baselines
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
what we've seen since um Wayfair was the
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
decided um a couple of years ago now was
 
04:19:48.189 --> 04:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
um a a kind of Rapid I think in tax
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
World um movement to um implementing
 
04:19:54.550 --> 04:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
some and sometimes all but often just
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of the features that South Dakota
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
had so um the sales tax Institute and a
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
number of other um online resources
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
keeps an update on what Nexus is is
 
04:20:06.510 --> 04:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
necessary in various taxing authorities
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
um to be subject to their tax rules and
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
um Most states have gone in the
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
direction of um South Dakota at least
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the minimum um gross transaction um
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
of $100,000 and some of them have also
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
done the two or the 200 um individual
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
transactions um and that actually is in
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
both directions there are some states
 
04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't have a minimum or had a
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
lower minimum that have upped it to
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 there are a number of states
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
that had minimums greater than $100,000
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
that have um had gone in the opposite
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
direction there are a couple of outliers
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
um a couple big States New York and
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
California have kept their thresholds at
 
04:20:45.309 --> 04:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
500 $100,000 or or up them to that
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
amount um my guess and this is just
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
speculation is that uh they are big
 
04:20:51.109 --> 04:20:51.119 align:start position:0%
enough states with large enough Revenue
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
sources that it's not cost efficient for
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
them to go after every single um
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
business that may be selling at $100,000
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
and they've determined internally that
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit becomes worth it at at
 
04:21:05.070 --> 04:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
half a million um there are um is still
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
one state um Kansas that has no
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
Threshold at all um and that has been a
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
point of controversy in Kansas it
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
resulted in a dis agreement between the
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
Kansas Governor and the Kansas Attorney
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
General um and uh but as of right now
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a proposal to go to
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 but it it hasn't happened um
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that that is kind of the one outlier
 
04:21:27.109 --> 04:21:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the other
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
direction um you will see um if you were
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
to go um and I can certainly share with
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
the committee um links to this um and
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
and they will be in the annual report as
 
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
well but if you were to go to to see
 
04:21:39.070 --> 04:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
what um various states are doing you'll
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
see that some states have kind of staged
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
out their implementation of this over
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
time so some are already at the the
 
04:21:46.990 --> 04:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
limits they're going to be at the Nexus
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
some are going to do it over time um but
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
but for the most part they are
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
coalescing around about $100,000 some of
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
them with 200 transactions um and so
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
those are kind of markers that are
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
consistent with what South Dakota had in
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
the Wayfair
 
04:22:04.349 --> 04:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
decision um in terms of the streamlined
 
04:22:06.109 --> 04:22:06.119 align:start position:0%
sales tax group we have had some
 
04:22:08.550 --> 04:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
communication with them um there are 23
 
04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
states that are full participants in
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
that group there's one state that is a
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I think an associate um member um so
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
that leaves 26 states that are not
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
members and it leaves the District of
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
Colombia and Puerto Rico um which are
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
also not members um I think the hope at
 
04:22:26.030 --> 04:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
least indicated by the Supreme Court
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
majority in Wayfair is that more States
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
would join that that would be kind of a
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
centralized um Clearing House for for
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
this process um and there hasn't been
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
much movement at all in the two years
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
since the decision came down um and so
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've had some conversations with them
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
because 24 States is is a large
 
04:22:44.189 --> 04:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
Collective audience of places that if we
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
could get some sort of um
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement or agreement in place
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
with with those States um all at once um
 
04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
could potentially help our businesses
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
could potentially help our consumers um
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
we had conversations um kind of very
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
informal conversations early in 2020 um
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
but like so many things that's been
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
largely derailed um by the pandemic and
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're just starting to turn to turn back
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
to that now um the one other thing that
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
I wanted to provide um an update on
 
04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
before um I open it up to questions was
 
04:23:15.990 --> 04:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
um as as most if not all of you are
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
aware um something that has happened in
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
the tax realm recently is is we've
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
brought a um an original jurisdiction
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
action against the state of
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um in in the context of
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
their attempts to collect income tax
 
04:23:29.149 --> 04:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire residents who were
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
working within New Hampshire um that was
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
the culmination of an effort that really
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
went hand inhand with the efforts we
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
were already making in the way Fair um
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
context one of the things that we've
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
been working on um behind the scenes and
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to to to make public and
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
still are in the relatively short term
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
is a formal position that the state of
 
04:23:48.870 --> 04:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire through the Department of
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
Justice is taking on many of the things
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
that I've already discussed um and and
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing within the
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire and whether that is
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
potentially unconstitutional or
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise unlawful but in order to
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
enforce that we would need to um be able
 
04:24:04.830 --> 04:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
to clearly articulate New Hampshire
 
04:24:06.429 --> 04:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
Sovereign interests and we would likely
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
need to enforce it at the United States
 
04:24:09.790 --> 04:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that's the only forum for
 
04:24:11.149 --> 04:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
one state to bring a challenge against
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
the other another state um one of the
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
kind of unfortunate but unique
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities that has arisen during the
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic is um an an opportunity to test
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
at least our sovereignty theories at the
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the context of the
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
income tax um dispute and so a lot of
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
the work that we were already doing um
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
Advanced um when that issue came to the
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
Forefront um when it was clear those
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
taxes were going to be imposed and they
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
were going to be imposed um
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
retroactively starting to the beginning
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic um a lot of the work
 
04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
we've been doing in Wayfair um
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
translated well into that and vice versa
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
we we have we developed our arguments to
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
a point that we were prepared to file
 
04:24:50.109 --> 04:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
them about a month ago at the US Supreme
 
04:24:52.590 --> 04:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
Court um and that certainly Advanced our
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
ability to to articulate New Hampshire
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
Sovereign interests and the policy
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
choices that we've made as a state um
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
which which um in many respects overlap
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about sales tax or
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
income tax um just the very final point
 
04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to make um is um we are not
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
aware currently of any state that is
 
04:25:11.790 --> 04:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
operating inside New Hampshire um
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
collecting sales of use tax or
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
attempting to from New Hampshire
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in a way that does not
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
comport with the law um but we again
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there there's a there's
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
a decent likelihood that as States um
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out how to balance
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
their budgets um this may be something
 
04:25:29.109 --> 04:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
that becomes um becomes a priority that
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe wasn't prior to the pandemic
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
um and and we have to keep a close look
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
at that and so we are continuing to
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
monitor um continuing to take in all
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
information we can um and to the extent
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
that you have constituents that are
 
04:25:43.990 --> 04:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
asking questions about this um that have
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
issues with respect to States reaching
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
out I would encourage and ask um that
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
you have them get in touch with our
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
office it it is incredibly helpful um
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
the challenge of course is that we can't
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
always provide them ex explicit advice
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
or help but it is very helpful as we're
 
04:26:00.189 --> 04:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
figuring out what's happening within New
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how this is impacting the
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
business Community um so again I thank
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to be here um I
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
have representative Edwards has a
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
question Follow by representative
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
abami I I think he said Edwards so I'll
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
Plunge in so thank you Mr Garland I just
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure I understand
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
what sounded like um a distinction
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
between your early comment and your
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
final comment about other states and
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're uh complying with
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
the law you initially I thought you said
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
there were some states but you didn't
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
name any that had uh probed our
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
businesses in search of sales taxes that
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
was my understanding and then and so I
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
just want to understand what sounds to
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
be two different
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
statements yes thank you representative
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that's my fault um I I probably can
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
conflated two different things um so we
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
are aware um through through
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
confidential reports that we received
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
from businesses that that are
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
confidential under um under chapter 7 um
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
8e um of Communications that they've
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
received from from other states it's a
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
small number um and I and I think I can
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
get a list of the states for you I don't
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
have it at my fingertips um but uh but
 
04:27:24.269 --> 04:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's a small number that have at least
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
um probed is probably a good word it may
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
be um an initial notice or something
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
along those lines I'm not aware of any
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
um firm collection efforts or any audits
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
or things along those lines but but
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
certainly some
 
04:27:37.389 --> 04:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
Communications um th those states have
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
reached out uh directly to the
 
04:27:40.510 --> 04:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and we find out because the
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
businesses share share it with us
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
um through through a process that that
 
04:27:47.550 --> 04:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
we're um that we try to facilitate under
 
04:27:50.349 --> 04:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
78e um the the other um requirement in
 
04:27:53.309 --> 04:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
chapter 78e um is is a requirement that
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
business or that that states that are
 
04:27:57.269 --> 04:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
seeking to collect um sales and use tax
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
from our businesses provide notice to
 
04:28:02.109 --> 04:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice um before they
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
start those sorts of inquiries um we do
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
not have any of those notices and so in
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
in one respect um I I think the states
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
that are that are reaching out to
 
04:28:12.670 --> 04:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
individual consumers are are probably
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
not complying with with our law um uh it
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
it they they appear to be in in a small
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
number of circumstances that we're aware
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
of contacting um individual uh
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
businesses remote sellers within New
 
04:28:27.109 --> 04:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and and at least sending um
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
form notices um but but the larger
 
04:28:31.630 --> 04:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
question um I think before we could
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
bring bring an action against the state
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
like that um in at least in the united
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme States Supreme Court is is what
 
04:28:41.070 --> 04:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing also inconsistent with the
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
US Constitution because because our
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce our law um is
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important but it's not
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
something that the Supreme Court is
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
going to take up we would have to find
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
another Avenue to do it um if it would
 
04:28:54.510 --> 04:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
require basically a violation of the
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution the dormant or the
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
com commerce clause or the due process
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
clause um before The Supreme Court would
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
entertain that sort of um action and
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm not aware of of of any
 
04:29:07.830 --> 04:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
state that that is clearly violating the
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution um particularly
 
04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
given kind of the the the suggestions
 
04:29:14.349 --> 04:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
but not clear directions that that the
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
way Fair majority put into its opinion
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
most of the states appear to be hewing
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
relatively close to those things um and
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
before we could take a position um you
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
know at the highest quarter of the land
 
04:29:27.149 --> 04:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
that a state is violating um the US
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution um we would need to be very
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable that that that is something
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we have um clear standing to do um
 
04:29:36.109 --> 04:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not aware of any state that
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
um where that's the case and and that's
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
frankly why we need more information
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
because we both need to get to encourage
 
04:29:43.710 --> 04:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
states to the best of our ability to
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
contact us or um and provide us the
 
04:29:47.550 --> 04:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
notice they're supposed to but we need
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be aware of of what state laws are I
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
mean I can do that independently and and
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
we do keep kind of a running updated
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
list on what's Happening um but we want
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that what's actually
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
going on on the ground comports with the
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution as well so so I
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
want to thank you because that did
 
04:30:06.269 --> 04:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
clarify my misunderstanding and then I
 
04:30:08.269 --> 04:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
just have a followup maybe it's a yes or
 
04:30:11.790 --> 04:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
a no when you hear of a state probing
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
businesses uh and you know the state for
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure are is the doj sending them a
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
letter letting them know of our state
 
04:30:26.189 --> 04:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
law we haven't yet um we we have um a
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
letter that that is is functionally
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
drafted at this point it was something
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we were going to start doing um
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
fairly early on this year but in
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
conjunction with that we wanted to
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
release a public position statement that
 
04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
um that both our businesses and other
 
04:30:40.750 --> 04:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
states were aware of of kind of the
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
lines that we were drawing in sand um
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
that that really frankly just did not
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
get out in the way we that's another
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
document that we have drafted but but
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
didn't get finalized in the way that we
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
were comfortable sending out before both
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit which and initially
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
took away um some resources that are now
 
04:30:58.109 --> 04:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
back on this project but also before the
 
04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts income tax thing really
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
came to the Forefront and provided us an
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop many of the
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
things that would be in that position
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
statement in the context of um active
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
litigation so I would expect um in the
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
relatively short term um that that
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
position statement will be out and that
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
we will be um directly contacting States
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
um in kind of drawing our Line in the
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
Sand that they should be complying with
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
our law um I can tell you that in my
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
conversations with Revenue who who are
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
much more aware of um of what other
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue authorities are doing um they
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
did not seem to think High seem to think
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
it was particularly likely that other
 
04:31:36.910 --> 04:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
states would ever voluntarily um comply
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
with the notice requirement but finding
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
a way finding ways to encourage them to
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
do so is high on our list of things that
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that we would like to accomplish um as
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
part of this of implementing this law
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much byebye thank you
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
rep representative abrami has his hand
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
up is it still up yeah
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
almost my questions were answered and
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
had similar questions so it when we pass
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
our laws is there's no one in these
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
other states that are paying attention
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
to laws of other states that's what I'm
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
hearing or they just decided to ignore
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
them they you think they're aware or
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
they just ignoring
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
them um I think there that's a question
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
that Revenue would probably be able to
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
answer a little better than me because
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
um usually it's the revenue authorities
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
in other states the equivalent of our Dr
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
that are that would be sending notices
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and I think would be the agency that
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
would be contacting our office were they
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
complying with the law um my my um
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
understanding though is that this law
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
caught attention among um tax kind of
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
the tax academics the tax um law world
 
04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
and also in in state taxation law um in
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
a way that that they're certainly aware
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
of it um my guess isn't that it's kind
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
of a Brazen attempt to ignore our law
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
really what this case is about or what
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
this law is about more generally and
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
frankly what Wayfair is about and what
 
04:33:05.070 --> 04:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
the income tax case is about more
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
generally is how sovereigns in an age
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
where business has done so much remotely
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
um both in terms of remote sell but also
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
you know remote workers in the income
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
tax context um there are no the the the
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
lines were you know the lines of
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
sovereignty are a little bit more
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
blurred physical presence is not a um a
 
04:33:25.949 --> 04:33:25.959 align:start position:0%
clear rule anymore that may make sense
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the modern economy and so I what I
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
really think is happening is we are
 
04:33:32.429 --> 04:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
staking our position in the law um that
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
that the legislature passed and the
 
04:33:34.869 --> 04:33:34.879 align:start position:0%
governor signed and that we're that
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
we're implementing and other states are
 
04:33:39.629 --> 04:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how much push back
 
04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
they can give us I don't think they're
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
doing it in way to to just ignore us or
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
disrespect us I think it's really as
 
04:33:47.551 --> 04:33:47.561 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find where the the
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
proper line is in terms of Nexus and and
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and due process considerations um it
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
remains in flux and so I think that's
 
04:33:58.551 --> 04:33:58.561 align:start position:0%
frankly where it is and that's and
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's something that is that
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
does factor into the Constitutional
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
considerations right the Supreme Court
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
would not be a forum for us to enforce
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law but if we have a
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable law that states are not
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
complying with um that is something that
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
that that I imagine we could um raise in
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
the context of of a commerce clause or
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
due process um due process argument and
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
so um I I I am gaining uh quite a bit of
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
of knowledge of this area of law but we
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
work with outside Council that are
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
professional tax Council um to help us
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
with this and one of the refrains I
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
continue to hear is this is Cutting Edge
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
taxation law and and a lot of these
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
answers are in
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
flux followup please Susan so Sam yes
 
04:34:41.470 --> 04:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Amazon you're saying
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
that Amazon is complying that platform
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you will so are small businesses that
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
may sell through
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
Amazon to them it's kind of seamless I
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
would imagine that the taxes are just
 
04:34:57.150 --> 04:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
being collected for the states uh it's
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
tacked on to the bill that Amazon
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
charges and it's all seamless to our
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
businesses does that seem correct um I
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that is um I think largely correct
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple nuances to it that
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
I think can complicate it slightly um
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
first Amazon because there are you know
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are 40s something states that have
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
sales tax and then there are hundreds if
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
not thousands of other taxing
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions within States so various
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
counties or municipalities um it's very
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
tough even for some um for an entity
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
like Amazon to be on top of the changes
 
04:35:33.310 --> 04:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
in every single potential taxing um
 
04:35:36.750 --> 04:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and and my understanding um
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
which is now a couple months um a couple
 
04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
months stale probably my understanding
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
as of the summer is that Amazon um was
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
taking the position that it could not
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
guarantee even if it was providing this
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
particular service to sellers that it
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
was necessarily complying with other
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
laws um with with all of the laws that
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
it could be subject that the seller
 
04:35:56.830 --> 04:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
could be subject to so I think it does
 
04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
streamline it quite a bit but I think
 
04:36:00.670 --> 04:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
that there is always that that question
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
um because there is no there there's
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
been no congressional action in this
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
Arena you are dealing with a huge range
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
of potential um taxing authorities that
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
may have different rules in amaz does
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
not want to be in a position where it's
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
providing tax advice um the other
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
complicating factor is I I understand
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
that Amazon and other comparable
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
facilitators provide a fee for that
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
service and so I not all sellers are
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
likely willing or able to pay I think
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
something it was something to the to the
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
tune of two and a half percent or
 
04:36:30.990 --> 04:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
something like that to Amazon for that
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
service and so that that means there
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
could be a number of that aren't doing
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
it that's a different picture then okay
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.310 --> 04:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
R him Stringham has his hand
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
up yeah uh thanks for coming Sam I have
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
a question for you if uh I was wondering
 
04:36:55.709 --> 04:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
if the state has an opinion on this an
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
individual uh is living in Plymouth uh
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
working uh working at home for a
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts based business uh for
 
04:37:06.189 --> 04:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
several years he's laid off where does
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
he file for unemployment in
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or New
 
04:37:12.189 --> 04:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that's a that's a very
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
interesting question thank you
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative it's something that um I
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
once again would have to defer to
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
revenue ultimately on I can tell you
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
that in um in the course of developing
 
04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
um some of our arguments and doing the
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
background research um for the income
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
tax petition that we filed back in
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
October that's a question that came up I
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
don't have a clear answer for you um I
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
can certainly follow up with our outside
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
um outside Council on that and see if I
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
can get you on um and I think Revenue
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
may actually be in a better position to
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
to answer that too because I know we
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
touch base with them um in the context
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
filings so
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
um it sounds uh I know
 
04:38:06.349 --> 04:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
that that there are other facilitators
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
also that
 
04:38:07.680 --> 04:38:09.269 align:start position:0%
also that
are

04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
charging to collect sales tax on I
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that they that the seller
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
had an option on this so it sounds
 
04:38:24.670 --> 04:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
like as long as there's a
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
$100,000 limit on this that sellers
 
04:38:30.269 --> 04:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
could say I'm never going to reach a
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 I'm not
 
04:38:32.199 --> 04:38:35.429 align:start position:0%
100,000 I'm not
paying

04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.551 --> 04:38:39.561 align:start position:0%
um but o otherwise
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
um there
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
their their limit for the cost of the
 
04:38:47.070 --> 04:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
administration is going to be two and a
 
04:38:47.080 --> 04:38:48.910 align:start position:0%
administration is going to be two and a
half

04:38:48.910 --> 04:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
per. something which isn't something we
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
can take to the Supreme Court and say
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's an undue burden I
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
think I think that would be um a
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
challenge Madam chair um I two and a
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
half percent is a number that that comes
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
to mind I think with respect to Amazon
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't hold me to that and I'm
 
04:39:08.590 --> 04:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
not sure the other um facilitators which
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
would be companies like Etsy like eBay
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
like Fair um are are necessarily um I I
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
know part of the the complication at
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
least as of um the spring was that there
 
04:39:22.510 --> 04:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
was no uniformity even in what
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
facilitators were doing which just adds
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
another layer of complication to this
 
04:39:28.750 --> 04:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
process which makes you know burden on
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
our businesses but I but I do agree with
 
04:39:34.590 --> 04:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
the the general thought um that if we're
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to go to the Supreme Court with
 
04:39:37.868 --> 04:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
this it would probably be a commerce
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
clause or due process or maybe priv
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
privileges and immunities federal
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional claim that the US Supreme
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
Court has taken the position in the
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
modern era that even though there's no
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
other forum for one state to sue another
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
um it has discretion as to whether it's
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to hear a case at all um and it is
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
only heard in the last 60 or so years
 
04:39:58.750 --> 04:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
about half of the cases that one state
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
has brought against the other so you
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
need to convince them that it is a
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
matter of national importance that deals
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
with State sovereignty I frankly think
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that that I think
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
Wayfair confirms that that this is an
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
issue that kind of checks those boxes in
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
the larger sense but before the state of
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could um realistically
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
bring that action I think we' need to
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
have a pretty clear um violation of of
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution and and clear
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
operation by one state with within New
 
04:40:26.310 --> 04:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that doesn't mean there aren't
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
other options and and so one thing we're
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
constantly thinking about is how um if
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
these issues arise in different contexts
 
04:40:34.030 --> 04:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
with individual taxpayers with
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
individual businesses um before
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies um how can the
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um ensure that
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um interests are Vindicated
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
through that and and I don't have any
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
great answers to you about that but but
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're not putting all of our eggs in in
 
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court basket and there
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
may be other ways that we can um we can
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
enforce New Hampshire law and enforce um
 
04:40:56.470 --> 04:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know and vindicate some of these
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
interests short of the Supreme Court but
 
04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's the clearest path for us as the
 
04:41:01.868 --> 04:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
state to bring bring bring an action
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's really the only path for us as the
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
state to bring an
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
action thank you and I I do um the other
 
04:41:16.590 --> 04:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
states uh legislators at least as in
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
ncsl people who deal with budget and
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
taxes are obviously still regarding New
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a thorn in the side that
 
04:41:28.470 --> 04:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to be able to learn to
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
ignore so they are noticing us it's been
 
04:41:34.350 --> 04:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
in tax notes several
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
times it has been and one thing that I
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
didn't provide any update on but that
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
does happen from time to time is we do
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
get press inquiries this is something
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
that um that has caught attention of of
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
groups like tax notes um of law 360 and
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
other trade Journal it's caught some
 
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
attention in the local press um and we
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
are very we try to be very Discerning in
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
in when and how we give comments to the
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
Press about this because that's largely
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
outside of of our role in implementing
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
it but but um but it is something that
 
04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
when when I speak with outside Council
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
who are who's involved in this who's
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
reading all of the tax notes that come
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
out who who's very much aware of how
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
state taxation um is developing this
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
remains a a significant issue several
 
04:42:18.430 --> 04:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
years on and it's one that I frankly not
 
04:42:20.670 --> 04:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
sure we any closer to a clear answer on
 
04:42:22.110 --> 04:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
than we were when the wa Fair decision
 
04:42:22.120 --> 04:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
than we were when the wa Fair decision
came

04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
came
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much for doing this
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions brom's hand is
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
up oh so it is just a more of a comment
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
Sam you know the issue we I know we were
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
working on this a year or so ago was up
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
to what 10,000 taxing jurisdictions
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that's the biggest
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
problem Ian it's not just 50 states it's
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
it's all the counties and city taxes so
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
everybody little bit of a tax and not in
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but most States the cities
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
have taxes Counties have taxes sales
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
taxes on top of and uh I you know yeah
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
it has to go to Supreme Court but I
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
think Supreme Court was has really been
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
crying out State uh Federal legislators
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
fix this will you I mean that's really
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
what has to happen really has to be
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
fixed by the by the legislature because
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
this is really complex I mean it really
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
is complex and that the Court's not
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
gonna they're gonna throw their hands up
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
again and say jeez you
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
know yeah I'm sorry goe to go you go
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
ahead no I'm done just more of a comment
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
than yeah I just I I've been on
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
still behaving since Norm has been been
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
not able to do it as the thorn in the
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
side in ncsl and I've been firmly told
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
that the general principle of ncsl is
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
that the states shouldn't have to be
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
told what to do by the
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
feds and that there is no way that
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to help me do something
 
04:44:08.708 --> 04:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
that would get get a state a federal law
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
put in that would clarify all of this
 
04:44:12.910 --> 04:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
because that would be telling each state
 
04:44:13.948 --> 04:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
what to
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
do so I don't know if
 
04:44:16.718 --> 04:44:18.990 align:start position:0%
do so I don't know if
CSG

04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
CSG
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
is has any different position of it if
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
Senator delis Sandro is still online but
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the position
 
04:44:34.230 --> 04:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
ncsl well I don't to to to answer your
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
question um I I don't I don't think CSG
 
04:44:40.230 --> 04:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
has a a statement on it I haven't
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
haven't checked with the but I I will
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
check with him I'm on a conference call
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
with him on the 30th of of the month we
 
04:44:49.390 --> 04:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
could we can talk about this
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a you know it's an issue that
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
ncsl has been on for a long period of
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
time every time we go to a meeting
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a proclamation that
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
everyone should get into the sales tax
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
business and New Hampshire's always been
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
always been against it so you know we've
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
been pretty consistent in our position
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll we'll see what we'll see
 
04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
what happens and there there are there
 
04:45:18.590 --> 04:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
are businesses in New Hampshire who do
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
conformed by the way and who have been
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
conforming for a long period of time so
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's another that's another
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
situation but
 
04:45:30.240 --> 04:45:32.110 align:start position:0%
situation but
anyway

04:45:32.110 --> 04:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
s says this is this is an issue that
 
04:45:35.638 --> 04:45:36.708 align:start position:0%
s says this is this is an issue that
involves

04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
involves
 
04:45:40.590 --> 04:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
counties cities and and just uh it's
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's you know many many many many many
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions L I think and to both I
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
mean and everybody
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
really it's the solution because even
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
the states that tax their businesses
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
have the same problem we're having our
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
businesses their businesses are having
 
04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
the same problems we are our businesses
 
04:46:02.590 --> 04:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
are complying with all of this yeah you
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
would think that they'd want to come up
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
with some kind of a unified uh software
 
04:46:06.718 --> 04:46:08.230 align:start position:0%
with some kind of a unified uh software
something

04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere that would uh make it easier
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
for people to comply not that we want
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know but right now it's an
 
04:46:17.788 --> 04:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
impossible thing for our businesses to
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
comply um if this would have if States
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
would have really pushed us but on the
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
same hand their their businesses and
 
04:46:26.750 --> 04:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
their states have to comply to all of
 
04:46:26.760 --> 04:46:28.830 align:start position:0%
their states have to comply to all of
these

04:46:28.830 --> 04:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
10,000 it isn't just us for
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
sure yeah my only you got your hands
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
full that's all I can say good luck good
 
04:46:40.990 --> 04:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
luck I have one one more update actually
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
that representative um AB rami's comment
 
04:46:45.070 --> 04:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
um that that I neglected to include
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
before is there has been and I don't
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
think it's been a major movement in this
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
direction but one encouraging thing that
 
04:46:53.830 --> 04:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
I've seen somewhat recently um is the
 
04:46:55.390 --> 04:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
state of Alaska this this may be
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging more of a national issue un
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
less of a New Hampshire specific issue
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't get much further
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
away in terms of of the state but um but
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
the state of Alaska is one of the
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
examples that is usually held up as
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
having you know hundreds of different
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions it has no Statewide sales
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
tax but but municipality is able to do
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
what it wants um and one thing that that
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
has occurred there um uh relatively
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
recently is that the Alaska remote sales
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
tax commission um has
 
04:47:25.150 --> 04:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
passed an optional um common definition
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
that does set um thresholds comparable
 
04:47:29.548 --> 04:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
to what South Dakota had in Wayfair um
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary um but but at my last
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
check which was um not today but but
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
within the last couple of weeks there
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
were several dozen um municipalities in
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
Alaska that had signed on to it and so
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
there could be a movement and I'm not
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
saying that that you know that New York
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
or other states that have um
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipality or or or or um county level
 
04:47:51.150 --> 04:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
taxation are necessarily going to go
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
this route but that is that was an
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
encouraging thing to see that there does
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
seem to be a voluntary willingness um in
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
a state like Alaska to try to make it
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
more uniform um and so that may be
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
something that that we see going forward
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
but but I agree with all of the comments
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
um that that this is an extraordinarily
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
complicated issue that that's going to
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
require Congressional intervention and
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
um and it's something that Congress has
 
04:48:15.548 --> 04:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
at various points had bills in front of
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
it that that would that designed to
 
04:48:18.750 --> 04:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
address and and they haven't really made
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
it anywhere um perhaps uh you know if if
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
things continue the way that they have
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
with with the pandemic and perhaps if
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is something where States become
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
more aggressive there may be more
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
movement on a national level um but but
 
04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
we are here to continue monitoring we're
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
here to continue to to try to figure out
 
04:48:37.708 --> 04:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
what states are doing and um to ensure
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
that if states are are crossing um you
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
know constitutional Lin
 
04:48:43.390 --> 04:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
um we're we're prepared we're prepared
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
to do what what what we can to to help
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
here thank you Sam thank you thank you
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there's no further discussion I'm
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
very glad you came today thank you for
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
updated then um I think
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
say on we can
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
adjourn Susan thank you very much for
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%

04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
the credit with J 4 having a little uh
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
for putting this
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
together well rep me I'd have to switch
 
04:49:46.750 --> 04:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
that and say Jennifer Reser deserves
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
most of the credit because the meeting
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
together is I think the most difficult
 
04:49:53.310 --> 04:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
part and running it I just want to make
 
04:49:56.030 --> 04:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
a comment too as well that if there's
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that members think of
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
