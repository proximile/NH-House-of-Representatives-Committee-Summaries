00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
one all right so we'll open up the work
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
session um
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
1394 relative to lure and regulation of
 
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.230 align:start position:0%
1394 relative to lure and regulation of
Music

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
Music
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
therapist this went before Edna came out
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
of their committee uh without a
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation then it went to the house
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
floor ought to pass as
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
amended on the 22nd of February and the
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
vote was 194 to
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
186 so pretty close um someone here like
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to the
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none um anybody on the
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
division wish to speak to a
 
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
division wish to speak to a
representative

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman so um I'm
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'm against this for the reasons I Carol
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
was the main person who argued against
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
this on the floor and I'm I'm against it
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
for those those reasons that she
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
articulated but I do happen to have
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
an you know we're starting to think this
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
may be un stoppable so um so I I do have
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment because if you look at the
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um this spends $70,000 a
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
year because they want oplc wants to
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
hire a new uh
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
employee but but strictly speaking that
 
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
employee but but strictly speaking that
particular

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
employee is not necessary for
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for music therapists
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
because there's only 30 music therapists
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they're only going to charge them
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
$150 every two years for their license
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
fee so we're talking
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
about $4,500 every two years or
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
something like that right and so um so
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
what this amendment would
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
do is reduce the budget by not having
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
that particular employee but but
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
allocating to them
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
$33,000 in their annual budget for
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
temporary or part-time uh help now um
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
representative cell had the idea maybe
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
we should also we could also say um
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
overtime in addition to that I don't
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
know um Melissa if if we is that the
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
same line item or is it we'd have to
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
pick one or how would that work we can
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
just add it into the bill and then they
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
can put it during the um dur during the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
budget and they can allocate where they
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
think it needs to so do you want to
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
change this to add or overtime I don't
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah just add that to the list
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
how about that Melissa
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions or
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
represented grassy I don't exactly have
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
a question I think that that probably
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
adding overtime would be fine to to this
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
as well um having worked in special
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
education I see a value in in having
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
this because I know that and and I
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
worked as an art therapist but you
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't build and that was part of the
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
problem is is being able to Bill uh
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or Medicare for these Services
 
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.670 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or Medicare for these Services
um

00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
and if you can't bill a lot of times you
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
just don't provide the service
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because you don't have
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
enough time in the day and and as a
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
special ed provider I know that they
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
were looking at every minute of the day
 
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
that you work you had to account for so
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
that they could get reimbursements for
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
it um because it's it's it's additional
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
cost to for special needs children in
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
our districts uh so I would support this
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why we didn't put art
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
therapists with it as well because it's
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
certainly something that is is used and
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
was used very effectively in my
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
experiences I'm not sure if art
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
therapists are already licensed or not
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay more discussion on
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment so are we okay with adding
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
overtime as representative cambrell has
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that's fine just to show a
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
hands at support of the
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
amendment unanimous
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
um we can take that up as a final next
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
week we'll just bring it in as corrected
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
yeah you have two options because this
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
is division one you can just vote on it
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
as amended um with adding the overtime
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have the amendment in
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
front of you to vote on it so you could
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
three so I have a 15 minutes so I have a
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for representative
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire you brought the amendment
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
forward but you voted against it so I
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious on your said I I I
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
said I was going to do all right I just
 
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm against the bill but I'm
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
also against spending $70,000 right so
 
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.990 align:start position:0%
also against spending $70,000 right so
[Laughter]

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
well well while we have a minute I just
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
thought i' give that's why the vote was
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
close right
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
Jose yeah
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
yeah all right um so while we have a
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
minute I just I'd update the division on
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
uh Bill reform as you know we had a
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
meeting last week there was a lot of
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
discussion there was a little confusion
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
because some of the uh as the clerk said
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
if you pull a string out of one the
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing would come apart so uh what
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
I have done is I sat down with Mr
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
Hoffman uh and we're going to
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
consolidate all the bills into one so
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
it' be easier to deal with so the U LBA
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
can put together a better fiscal note
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
because we had competing fiscal notes
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
and they didn't jive with each other you
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
know some of the bills said we had
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates but didn't fund them others
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
said we funded them but didn't give what
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
their roles were so uh Within the next
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
couple of days we'll have a a bill that
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
combines everything and we'll take it up
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday when we come we'll be me
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
meeting next Wednesday whatever date
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
that is the 20th I think can can I
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
suggest something yes sure we have so
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
along those lines you remember last week
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh we we acted on I think um where was
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
the judicial one judicial training House
 
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.390 align:start position:0%
the judicial one judicial training House
Bill

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
105 I believe we passed at
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
otpa and and I had an idea about that
 
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
one because these bail bills want to
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
train um uh bail Commissioners better
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
right so if you remember what we did
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
with judicial training we hired the
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
coordinator but we delayed it until the
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
next budget so so I would think maybe we
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
could fold that one in and hire the ba
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
the the training person right away and
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
say okay your first job is bail
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners right um and that way it
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
kicks it off gets it rolling faster
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah we can take a look at that okay
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
is that what about no but I was going to
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
just mention that but but um so I don't
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
know if it's necessary for us to like
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
reconsider you
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
know what we did or just we
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
as long as we don't execute in the full
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee next week then we're okay
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
unless we do it in the context of our
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
review of the bill yeah that seems like
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
it make S yeah let's we'll pull that up
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
because under this
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion what we did last week I want
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
something all right so we'll take a look
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
at U we have a minute does anyone have a
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
copy of the do you have HB one05 in
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah the amendment was a
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
so what I'm proposing now is that yeah
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
because you had an amendment that we
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
voted on yes and that we we did it we
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
916 yeah I think it was unanimous so
 
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.149 align:start position:0%
916 yeah I think it was unanimous so
[Music]

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
um they left it as shell in the
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah yeah but but um so so my
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
thought was to the list of things that
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
the coordinator does is provide judges
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
administrators Court staff Etc add bail
 
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.870 align:start position:0%
administrators Court staff Etc add bail
Commissioners

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
um and then change the effective date
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
back to 60 days after passage or
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
so because I believe in one of the bail
 
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.510 align:start position:0%
so because I believe in one of the bail
reform

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
bills there is a requirement for
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
training for bail Commissioners
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
so right so we could just
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
say itl or interim study this bill and
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
division to me it just makes more I'm
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
sorry no go ahead represent you to me it
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
just makes more sense to look at it I I
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea but it seems to
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
me like we should do it in the context
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
report I'm not sure any of us has
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
thought enough about we don't have to
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
make a decision now but I I I think this
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
is a good thing regardless of what we do
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
with bail reform that the bail
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners get training and having
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
this trainer out there I think is this
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
is just the first step and I think this
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
should be done regardless of whatever
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
else we do as far as bail reform is
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
concerned this training needs to be done
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
and that's been the problem with bail
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
reform up to this point is that the
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have received no training
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
so in frustrating so in House Bill 318
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
it does call for Bill commissioner
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
training yeah already that so in a sense
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
these two bills are redundant now
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
because what criminal justice did with
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
318 they totally gutted the bill there's
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
training in there there's a fee increase
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
in there um so there's probably a little
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
redundant with
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
105 only
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
if they probably don't have a training
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator that also does judges and
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the thing and and and and
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know what if that bill doesn't
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
pass that's a good point you know the
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
thing is having two bills out there that
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
do the training and this is I think it's
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
a little more geared towards the
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
training side of it that we should move
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
this one along and then if they both get
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
there that's
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
fine so but this sets up that position
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
for training yeah I mean it's not in
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
Conflict to just say they'll have
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
training no but you don't hire a person
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah but this is the bill with the
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
person oh you took it I was wondering I
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
mean I suppose we could hold this off
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
and do and merge it into the other two B
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
you know all the other bills at the same
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
time that would be one of the other Pro
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
situations we do but this one could be
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
done separately without affecting the
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
merging of the other bills right and I'm
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
not sure the prime sponsors
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
would necessarily want their bill to on
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
training to live or die on the what
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
happens to bail reform right right so
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so okay so why don't we my
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion just change the amend the
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh 916 AG to add those
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
two things right change the effective
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
date back to what it used to be which I
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
think was 60 days and add bail
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to the to the U what the
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
judicial training coordinator is
 
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.630 align:start position:0%
judicial training coordinator is
responsible

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
for all right more comments from the
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
division representative sweee you're
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay what does representative yout think
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
about this and this something that he
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
your thank
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.789 align:start position:0%
your thank
you

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
um grainy of course is the is the the
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
big issue as far as everybody is
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
concerned because uh there was there
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
been a lack of it for years and years
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
and years in the the superior court was
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit better because they had
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
regular meetings the whole court and
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
they would include some sort of uh
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
unofficial training in with their
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
meetings uh the place where the training
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
was most needed was in the district and
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
municipal courts and they didn't have
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
any I think that for 10 or 15 years I
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
was the only place in in the state that
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
had regular training sessions for bail
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I said with some
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
nights I would have 10 15 bail
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners most most of them not
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
coming from lonia they came from all
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
over the state uh to hear what what was
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
going on and in inevitably there was a
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
lot going on on because the legislature
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
session that's a very dangerous
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
thing and the legislature would change
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
this statute and the next statute and
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
come come about oh we had these these
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
sessions like in October and people
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
suddenly find out they' were doing the
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
wrong thing for nine months oh so yeah
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
train training is
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
crucial uh as I said I wouldn't worry
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
that much about this it's very for um
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
but as far as
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
the now I don't they follow yeah still
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
bail commission bail commission is in
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
The District Court District Municipal
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
type Court setting that's critical and
 
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:47.750 align:start position:0%
circuit that's
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.310 align:start position:0%
circuit that's
[Laughter]

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
old okay
 
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:10.710 align:start position:0%
old okay
all

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.549 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:27.029 align:start position:0%
right
oh

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:29.110 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%

00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
yep he's watching right now and he'll
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
also have representative Maguire's
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
afternoon I've got a bill that's in
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
another committee and I'm sort of
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track of where they are so I may
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
Le here
 
00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:56.909 align:start position:0%
Le here
quickly

00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:31:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
Lu

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
so now we'll open the work session on
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
1577 relative to digital images of
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
ballot and this is another one that came
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
out without recommend recation from the
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
committee election law it passed on the
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
house FL
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
otpa 193 to 182 back on the 22nd of
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
here yes we do it it seems it' be easier
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
for us to keep tabs and get people's
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
names spelled correctly thank you and if
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
you could state your name for the record
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
please thank you I'm representative
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
Alvin C from ladden representing eight
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
towns in marac
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
county and U House
 
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.389 align:start position:0%
county and U House
Bill

00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
1577 uh is a bill to um be able to allow
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
voters to view the digital images of the
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
new ballot counting
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
devices um and if they find any
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
discrepancies they can be formally
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
investigated by the
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
AG uh the two primary things that people
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
would look for was does the machine
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
correctly read the ballots and the other
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
is do the vat counts add
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
up um this bill essentially provides an
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
inexpensive way to have somewhere all of
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
the new ballot counting devices uh
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
audited Al beit unofficially and with
 
00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.430 align:start position:0%
audited Al beit unofficially and with
Free

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
Free
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
Labor uh hiring professionals to do
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
extensive audits will likely be
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
considerably more expensive to get
 
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
considerably more expensive to get
similar

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
results um the fiscal note was not
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
updated after the amendment was approved
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
by the house um under the Staffing and
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
bullet uh equipment and Staffing bullet
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
point the it position would not be
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
needed all
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
year we do have an updated fiscal note I
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
one okay the uh the new fiscal note
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
still calls for hiring an IT position
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
but the um um one of the things the
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
amendment did was that the secretary's
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
request was to limit the time available
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
for doing these uh audits so the bill
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
calls for a maximum of four months after
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
the completion of uh recounts and and U
 
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.230 align:start position:0%
the completion of uh recounts and and U
any

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
um any uh appeals to the recounts so
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
after and and also after our primary
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
election there's only about a month or
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a week or two more that would be
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
available before the general election
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
before they have to get ready for
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
um so maybe five months every two years
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
plus town and City
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
elections and since there aren't as many
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
of them and those elections usually
 
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.389 align:start position:0%
of them and those elections usually
don't

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
take um have as many voters show up that
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
they may not even need full four months
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
after those
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
so in all intense purposes it would
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
probably be in the neighborhood of uh 7
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
to n months that this it person would be
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
needed for this project so if they were
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
to hire somebody maybe some of the uh uh
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
costs could be attributed to some other
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
account and the um software bullet
 
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.630 align:start position:0%
account and the um software bullet
point

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
point
um

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's um it still refers to one of
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
them as having a initial cost of $20,000
 
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
but that may be for a deluxe software
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
package I'm not um privy to all the
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
details of
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions would you take questions uh
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly will represent Maguire thank
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
for coming and taking my questions um
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
let's start with with the question of
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
timing do any any towns have these
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
Advanced machines and when would you
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
expect that we would need to be spending
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
money on this okay uh thank you for the
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
question yes there are five machines
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
already in use yesterday I cast my town
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
ballots in a new
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
machine um also that was in ladden and
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh Northwood Winchester and a couple
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
other town I don't remember which ones
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
they were um have the new machines great
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um at the time the ballot law commission
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
approved the um uh the
 
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
approved the um uh the
uh

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
machine uh boning Works had five
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
machines available at that time to
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
deliver so I'm sure they're stepping up
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
production thank you may follow so all
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
right so that's good so we need to do
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
this right away now the second question
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the expensive part of this if you
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
look at the page two of the fiscal note
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
is the the new employee um 82,000 88,000
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
87,000 per year um and will be necessary
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
to coordinate and manage the image
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
viewing process so the way this
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill implies is that uh people who want
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
to look at the ballots will come into
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
some some
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
place uh some meeting room and and our
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
employee will display them on some
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
screen or something so that people can
 
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
look at them right and that's why we
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
need the employee there but I'm
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's strictly necessary
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't you um simply sell copies of
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
the of the memory card to people and
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
they could in at their own time use
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
their own equipment and we wouldn't need
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
an employee to babysit them looking
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
through the ballots thank you in the uh
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:38:04.839 --> 00:38:07.309 align:start position:0%
the bill
itself

00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
um there is a provision in there that
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
the um um the last paragraph of it the
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
secretary May determine if copies of
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
removable memory devices or Digital Data
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the memory device may be provided to
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
The Observers that are examining the
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
digital image so if the secretary
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
chooses to just you know hand out or or
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
sell the U USB
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
chip to to people and let them use their
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
own computer at home that would
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
certainly be far less
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
expensive um it allows the secretary
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
to decide how stringent he wants to be
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
images do may I yes sure do you have
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that he would object
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
to having that be the only way this is
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
distributed as opposed to this image
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
because we would like to not I would
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
like not to hire this person because it
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
seems kind of a a useless task right I
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
mean I I would tend to agree with that
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
um in my discussions with the secretary
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
in development of this bill and and the
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um he didn't spe speci ify
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that he
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
would uh necessarily be willing to do
 
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.069 align:start position:0%
would uh necessarily be willing to do
anything

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
less uh
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
but other than that I I can't speak for
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
him because he just didn't say and the
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
the bill itself allows
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
for total control and just allowing an
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
observer to look at a screen while
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else manipulates it to handing
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
out copies whatever he wants to do he
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
can uh
 
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
can uh
also

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
um uh have uh non-disclosure agreements
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
signed and things like that so let me
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
question one so do you consider these
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
images to
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
be um not subject to 91a and proprietary
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing or is it is there
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
some harm in in letting these images out
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh there is there's some people have
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
expressed concern that somebody could uh
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
analyze the handwriting of somebody
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
writing in a
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
name if they happen to write in a name
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
and be able to identify the person uh I
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
think that's a little bit too small a
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
sample of a handwriting to to do that
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of analysis unless there was a lot
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
of writing on the bill and occasionally
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
people also put other sorts of comments
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh including even signing or
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
on the ballot and including even signing
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
the ballot uh um it's it's hard to say
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
so the bill does allow for um
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements and uh for
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
people who don't follow the terms to not
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
be allowed to proceed any further on
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
that any further
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing down thank you very
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
much okay and I thought maybe the
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
secretary would be here today to they're
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell I noticed that
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
your name was on the bill do you have
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
anything to add while we wait for the
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative from the Secretary of
 
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.069 align:start position:0%
representative from the Secretary of
State's

00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
office all right
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
thanks hi Erin welcome good morning Ain
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
um would you where would you like to
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
start let me start you have the mic okay
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
let me start with the memory cards so we
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
have um as you probably are aware we
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
have the acote device that we currently
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
used in most elections in the state we
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
still have hand countdowns um but the
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the ballots are counted by a
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
device yesterday was the first time that
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
one of the new devices met all of the
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals except
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
ultimate um vvsg 2.0 certification in
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
2026 and those are the new ballot
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
counting um standards set by the EAC um
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday was the first time in New
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that these devices were used
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
officially um and can be used going
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
forward um these devices capture images
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the ballots that are run through the
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
device not images of ballots that are
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
put into the side
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
pocket they also um capture information
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
about how the device counted that
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
ballot um this the language in this bill
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
talks about making public the
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
information um what is referred to as
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
the cast vote record but then nowhere in
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bill does it then go on to allow for
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
the viewing of the cast vote information
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding would be just the
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
images of the ballots um the reason why
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing would be needed is
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
to coordinate um not only the view in of
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
the ballots but the retrieval of memory
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
cards uh from towns that have these new
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
devices um the um purchasing of the
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
memory cards at this point in time we
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how many towns will end up
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
using one of the new um devices or
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
another uh we are we don't know if the
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
alternative device the the one device
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
that is being used currently is from
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
voting works it's an open source
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
software their memory card costs $10 or
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
less it's a USB card um the alternative
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
device that's working on meeting the
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals is from dominion
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
and that device has a proprietary memory
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
card I don't know the details behind how
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
much um the they estimate the cost to
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
purchase one would be approximately $50
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't um gotten in um anything in
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
writing about how much those would
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
actually cost I don't know if we would
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
be able to copy them or um if they would
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to do that themselves their
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
software to view the images um and the
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
cast vote record um they estimate our
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
purchase of it would be approximately
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
$2,000 but I don't know if that would be
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
for State purposes only or if that would
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
allow for every single um town that uses
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
their device so there's a lot of
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
monetary information that I still do not
 
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.150 align:start position:0%
monetary information that I still do not
know

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
um but my understanding is that we would
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
have to purchase these for all the towns
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
that we get their memory card from and
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
replace the memory card that we've taken
 
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.390 align:start position:0%
replace the memory card that we've taken
from

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
them um some of the reasons why we um
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally have not been in favor of
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
viewing a ballot is because there are
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
identifying marks that some voters put
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
on it um it would open the possibility
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
of vote buying um you could easily mark
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
it in a way that somebody knows that you
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
voted um the way that you said you were
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to vote um and we don't think
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea um altern
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
Additionally you can tell um uh how how
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who who uses an accessible ball
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
accounting device has voted um because
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
those marks are very per perfect
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
although it uses the official ballot um
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
you would be able to tell exactly how
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
that possibly just one person in your
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
polling location voted and um um the
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
purpose of the accessible voting device
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
is that so someone can have a a secret
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
ballot just like everyone else even if
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
they need um the assistance of a device
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
in order to vote that way um sorry I'm
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
sure there's other things I want to tell
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
you um so a lot of the cost is related
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
to memory cards and purchasing of the
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
software potentially from one of the
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
vendors the other vendor software is
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
approximately $500 a year um which I
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
would consider nominal
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the viewing of the I don't believe
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
that there would be any way we could
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
enforce a non-disclosure agreement if we
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
just hand out a memory card with all of
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
the images on it um and I I don't know
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
that that language for enforcement um is
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill so those are my some of
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
concerns about the language we would
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
need a new position we would need money
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
for memory
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
cards I believe we probably would have
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
space to do this um the timing wise I
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
think would take all year um I it
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit the number for each Town
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
viewing so if you wanted to come in and
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
view say I'm from Littleton littleton's
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
ballots and then I go and talk to
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
somebody in Littleton and then somebody
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
else from Littleton wants to come in and
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else from Littleton comes in so
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
I imagine even if it's just restricted
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
to four months after um the close of any
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
recounts then it's going to be 4 months
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
after town elections and four months
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
March Town elections four months after
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
April Town election four months after
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
May Town elections four months after um
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
City elections in the fall so it's it
 
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.349 align:start position:0%
City elections in the fall so it's it
would

00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
be um non-stop throughout the
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
year sometimes much more busy than
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
others so I guess my question to you is
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
does the office does your office support
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
signals I would I would say we don't
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
support the at this time the viewing of
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
digital images it would um because not
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
all ballots are scanned it would lead to
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
inaccurate um self- recounts um because
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have the complete election
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
information to go off of um and because
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
of the other concerns I mentioned about
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
the secret um your secret vote being
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
open for anyone to view it there is a
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of the devices does have a potential
 
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
one of the devices does have a potential
um

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
um way for you to link back and they're
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
supposedly fixing this but to link back
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
the cast vote record viewing the cast
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
vote record to how somebody voted by
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
recording which you can do in New
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire your entire election and you
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to look on the cast vote
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
record how the order of seron voted and
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
so linking viewing that information you
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
could see oh um chairman Lehman came in
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
he was the third voter of the day oh
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
this must be his ballot um they're work
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
I believe they're working on fixing that
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
but there are some there's still some
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
unknowns with the with one of the
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
devices which were required to be fixed
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to do this thanks Erin um
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
other questions for the depuy Secretary
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
of State yes representative wer followed
 
00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:16.630 align:start position:0%
of State yes representative wer followed
by

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
eil thank you hello Erin there's a lot
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
of distrust in the voting in in this
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
state especially in certain polling
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
places in my County I keep hearing about
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
the same places over and over again so
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
the more we can allow the public to
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
check on things the better and I like
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
the idea and if we give warning up front
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
don't Mark the ballot with anything
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
extraneous that could be traced to you
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
and and if you just let people I don't
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
understand I've seen it in voter counts
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
where people do stupid things like they
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
they vote a certain person then they
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
think they have to write in that
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
person's name where it says write in I
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
voted for Peter lean I write over here
 
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.630 align:start position:0%
voted for Peter lean I write over here
Peter

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
Peter
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
lean dozens of times and and there's
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
other patterns you see you can tell the
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
feminists come in and jump back and
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
forth looking for women's names you see
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of curious things when you when
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
you uh do recounts and you know let the
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
public be more informed and if you could
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
get a machine that makes it easy to copy
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
and easy to pass out
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
copies that here for 10 bucks or 15
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
bucks whatever you want to do take take
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
this home and look at it on your own
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
machine I think that would make for a
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
reassurance and a lot more help with
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
keeping the vote honest because I still
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of crooked voting in
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I you and I have had this
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
discussion and we don't always agree but
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen too much to say there isn't
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I would hope we could make this
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
thing with an ey to It Whatever machine
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
forget Dominion there's there's no trust
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
in the Dominion anymore they've stolen
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
too many election starting in Venezuela
 
00:51:06.359 --> 00:51:08.430 align:start position:0%
too many election starting in Venezuela
right

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
and and let's let's get another company
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
involved that has a little bit better
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
reputation and have things that are
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
clearly anybody can go and buy it and
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
look take the hours it takes to look
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
through it all and and keep the marks
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
for themselves but that I think that's
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's something we've got to work to it
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I hope the Secretary of State's
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
office will be cooperative in that thank
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
you representive kimbrells yes thank you
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
question so by your own testimony you've
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
stated that uh it sounds like Dominion
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be more restrictive and more
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
costly in terms of uh having an openness
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the information and I'm I'm one
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
that's for more transparency so is Domin
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
didn't guaranteed any contracts and any
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they're going to be
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
selling machines here to New Hampshire
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative so the ballot law
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
commission has conditionally approved
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
them and once they meet all of the
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
conditions um they can be used in New
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections right now um one of
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
the main conditions that they have to go
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
through is some of the vvsg 2.0 testing
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
standards that are office identified for
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
um mostly secur reasons um that they
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
would have to have those tested before
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
they can use them in New Hampshire so as
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
long as they meet that they and towns
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
would like to purchase them and again
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to the local local
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities here in New Hampshire
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
which device they would opt to use or
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
opt not to use a lot of people a lot of
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
towns still hand
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
count is that your
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
eel um nice to see you madam um just so
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
if I could summarize your testimony a
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
little bit would it be safe to say that
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
the costs are basically indeterminable
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
because you're not sure about the
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
database the memory cards and all those
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
sorts of things plus the Staffing that's
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
going to be needed to facilitate this is
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
that I I have a problem is that a fair
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
statement that's a fair statement
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
financially yes okay and then your your
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
big concern it sounds like to me is from
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
a privacy standpoint that it's even even
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative wer if you
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
chair Wier if you tell people not to
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
Mark things they may listen they may not
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
but you can tell them that but the real
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
concern is for the um accessible voting
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
machines that they are clearly being
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
voted by folks that need those machines
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
and um so your concern is really really
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
also from a privacy standpoint thank you
 
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
for the question privacy standpoint but
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
also from a transparency standpoint uh
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
to representative Wilder's some of his
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
comments um people want to make sure
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
things are transparent and we definitely
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
agree um but if you're only using a
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
subset of the ballots to come up with a
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
recount of your own you're not going to
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
have all of the information and a lot of
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
people won't understand that and they'll
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
think that something went wrong with the
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
election when in reality the machine
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
counted the ballots correctly and then
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
there was a sub count of federal office
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
only ballots um over voted ballots for
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
some reason the machine just didn't want
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
to read a certain ballot um so there's
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
always going to be hand count ballot
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't trust the machine they
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
put it in the hand count bin um so
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's they're just not going to be
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole set of information
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
um additionally this is would only
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
affect locations that use a ballot
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
counting device uh the new ones not the
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
acotes um so no one's going to be able
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
to do this for towns where they they
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
live in a hand count Town representative
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
kimbrells thank you Mr chair uh I
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but if
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
somebody is requesting the the
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
um memory card would you not also inform
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
them that oh and by the way there were
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
300 other ballots that were not counted
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
for various reasons so that they could
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
match up the numbers would you not
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
provide that information that
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
information would already already be
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
provided it's public information for all
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
elections on the return of votes either
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
locally or at the state level that's um
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
so any information that someone would
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
want we would give them so then what's
 
00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
want we would give them so then what's
the

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
information what's the problem with not
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
having all of the information I mean
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
no I said would be able to they would
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
you just stated they would the
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
information is accessible so combining
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
the memory card with the extren
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
information they have all the
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
information that they need in order to
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
match up the numbers so why is there a
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
problem the return of votes does not um
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
show how handc count ballots were C
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
calculated so it doesn't
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't show anyone's ballot
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
information um to to reconcile with no
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
one would be able to look at the hand
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
count ballots to say that is correct
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
that P that ballot was counted correctly
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
for Aaron
 
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hennessy so there's there's a subset of
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
information they can't look at those
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
hand count ballots nor can they look at
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
any hand count ballots in any hand count
 
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.029 align:start position:0%
any hand count ballots in any hand count
towns

00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:56:57.039 --> 00:56:58.910 align:start position:0%
towns
follow

00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
up represent Maguire thank you and thank
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
you for coming
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
so Hand count ballots um clearly people
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
see them when there's recounts yes right
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
okay um are they kept separate from the
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
other ballots uh physically when when
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
when the ballots are returned to you are
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
um and you open them for a recount do
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
you do you know okay this stack was the
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
hand count stack and that stack was the
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
machine count stack or not necessarily
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
not thank you for the question not
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily we get information back in
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
all sorts of manners um but sometimes
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
they just bundle up all the the ballots
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
and throw them in a box sometimes they
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
have them in stacks of 50 with labels on
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
them um not written on them just pie of
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
paper um so some towns we may be able to
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
determine that some towns we would not
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
be able to determine that may I follow
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
up so but you do training of all these
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
clerks and so on could you require that
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
is or would we need new law to to make
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
or um we could say best practice wise um
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted them to separately
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
boxed hand count ballot for recount for
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
recount purposes
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I believe you would have to put that
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
in to law okay all right the re where
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going with that is that this whole
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
display process happens way after the
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
election's already over and so at such
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
point when you're about to hand out the
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
memory images you could look in the box
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
take the envelope of hand counts scan
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
them yourself and add that picture image
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
to the to the image of the other ballots
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
right and and then there would be all
 
00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:53.390 align:start position:0%
right and and then there would be all
the

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
images thank you for the question yes
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
you're correct we would then have to
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
pick up the ballots every single box of
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
ballot from every location where
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to view these um for the
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of doing that oh I see so so
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
mostly ballots are stored at towns and
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
not with the secretary of state is that
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
right all ballots are stored locally
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
unless there is recount request and then
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
our office goes with two employees and
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
physically picks up those ballots all of
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
them all right thank you um let me
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
one other thing back to the question of
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
the employee and the viewing and all
 
00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.990 align:start position:0%
the employee and the viewing and all
that

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
um could uh what would you say if we
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
limited it strictly to Distributing
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
memory cards and not do the viewing and
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
all that you know that's the time
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
me there would
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
a very timec consuming part of
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
distribution of memory cards um it
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it definitely would not be a
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
full-time position um and then I would
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
still have the privacy concerns that I
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
had previously of course yes thank
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
you all right just a reminder to the
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
division we need to really focus on the
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
financial Impact versus the policy even
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
though I can see there was a lot of
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
debate since it came out of the
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
committee earlier with not a
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
so seeing no further questions for the
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state thanks Aon
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
always the Gent does the gentleman from
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association wish to
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
testifying if you could please fill out
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
a pink card for us when you're done yes
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we agree with
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary's uh position on this um
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
we did attempt to calculate uh the costs
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
associated with um with the original
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um and then looking at the
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the uh amended bill this
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
morning I don't believe we would change
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
any information that we provided to LBA
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
at their request um we're just unclear
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
exactly to what extent municiple
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
officials would be required to
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
participate in this process obviously
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of the review processes up
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the secretary um and and the the
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
processes instituted by the secretary um
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
certainly our local election officials
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
support them in that capacity and we do
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
whatever is
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
necessary um but we have to keep in mind
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that's just one of the roles that
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
town clerks and other local officials
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
play um you know we have a robust um
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
review process audit process I do know
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray has introduced another
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
bill this year Senate Bill 489 um to
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
update some of those audit processes
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
related to ensuring that the machines
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
are giving accurate counts I believe
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
he's worked with the Secretary of
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
State's office on that and then has been
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
sent over to the house for reviewing the
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
PO appropriate policy um committee
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to take any questions
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
the comme may have of me at this
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
time are there any questions for the
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
representative from the municipal
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:27.910 align:start position:0%
representative from the municipal
Association

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative um I just want to be
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
clear on your position on the bill so
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
you do you oppose it or we do oppose the
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill um as on mostly on policy reasons
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
but we're also unclear on what the costs
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
are because yeah so um but you have
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the costs because of uh
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
the sort of unknowns of how this is all
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
going to roll out and also you're
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
concerned for the employees of the towns
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
who are already very busy correct so the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
town clerk for example has a number of
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
roles in addition to election roles that
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
um he or she fulfills um with this
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
four-month kind of rolling process as
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
the secretary uh the deputy secretary
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
testified it's a year it's a year-long
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
process so while the town clerk may be
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
busy trying to do things like prepare
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the warrant for town meeting or
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
um they're also um being required to uh
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
act in a support position for the
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
secretary's office as one of the if one
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
of these requests comes in or multiple
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
requests come in um so it would be very
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
difficult with current Staffing levels
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure that every municipality uh can
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
adequately respond to these requests in
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
the manner that would be required by by
 
01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:53.870 align:start position:0%
the manner that would be required by by
this

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislation as we understand
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions seeing
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
feeling represent mire can we wait a
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
little till next week I I I need some
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
time to to process this and and perhaps
 
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
think of an amendment to uh make it make
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
it cheaper well talk with uh Miss
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
Hennessy offline and see if we can work
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
out a way to to make it cheaper and
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
workable um because I see the I see the
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
problems here and especially with the
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
hand count aspect of it um but I have an
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
idea of how that might be fixed
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
um but personally just to say I mean
 
01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:49.750 align:start position:0%
um but personally just to say I mean
personally

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
I having an employee to do this seems to
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
me not a valuable enough
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
thing to to justify it you know that's
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's my problem
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure this is a like
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
musthave with with
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
item all right any problem pushing this
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
to next week we are meeting so we can
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
add this to our agenda next
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
right I wanted to say senator Hennessy
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
then it was representative Hennessy and
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
um so Aon next week we'll reschedule
 
01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:34.470 align:start position:0%
um so Aon next week we'll reschedule
this

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%

have House Bill
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
1647 relative to the calculation of
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
group to retirement benefits and the
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system this came out of Edna
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
20 to0 ought to pass as

amended it came uh had a vote on the
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
house floor a Voice vote back on the 20

22nd of
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
February and there is
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
note thanks
 
01:06:26.119 --> 01:06:28.230 align:start position:0%
note thanks
and

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:47.630 align:start position:0%
and
mean

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
Melissa so if there's anyone out there
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak uh we are using
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
pink cards today try to keep things a
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
I was probably going to call on you
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can give you um representative
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
Maguire and I are on this bill this was
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
a result of a u retirement commission
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation last year and uh I see
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
that the Edna committee did amend the
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill slightly by requiring people to be
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
of full age before they could collect
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
the additional benefit and U Marty if
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's anything you think we should
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
know as far as if I know there's been a
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
slight reduction in the uh cost of a
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
million and or two but if you'd like to
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
speak to anything that you think would
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
be relative relevant for yeah Ju Just
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
Just for a background and I realize this
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
is a financial committee not a policy
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee I did um revise the handout I
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
provided to Edna for the initial public
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
hearing that's what Melissa just sent
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
around just for background uh on what
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
the change is it was updated to to note
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
that it only applies to members who
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
would qualify for service or disability
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
retirement I.E you know work through the
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the full career or were no longer able
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
to U through no fault of their own um so
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's all background just you know on
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
the the policy piece and some of the
 
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.149 align:start position:0%
the the policy piece and some of the
history

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh the second page of that handout is
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
something I know the chair is familiar
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
with we put this together for Edna as
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
well and this just shows the current
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
multipliers um for each of the group two
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
tiers and how the the bill would change
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
them after 10 years uh and when the the
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
minimum number of uh years worked were
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
for each of the the tiers and there some
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
some keys and some head counts on the
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
side so um just again more background on
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
the policy p P the the fiscal note the
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
the change the amendment
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
0326 uh out of house C DNA did reduce
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
the cost uh somewhat on the unfunded
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
liability I think believe the bill
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
continues carried over with the
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
55.9 million appropriation uh towards
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
the unfunded that number has gone down
 
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
the unfunded that number has gone down
to

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
53.6 in the analysis so if the bill were
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
re amended to that amount or if you kept
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
it at 55.9 it would just reduce the
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
liability a little bit more not
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
associated with this proposal but just
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
generally speaking so um a lot of
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
numbers a lot of things moving around be
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions but
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's where I'd like to start sort of
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
setting it
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
up let me just say how fortunate we are
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
to have you and we've all agreed that
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
you can never retire even though you
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
work at the retirement commission
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm still still really it's a a
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
learning process in this whole matter
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
but um other there questions for
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
Marty again you must have done an
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you sure thanks
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
much the municipal Association would rep
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to it or
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.990 align:start position:0%

speaking

morning house finance division
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
one Representative Steve Pearson
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13 representing the
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
town of dery just um I just wanted to
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
come up here and just make a little bit
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
of a reminder a reminder that
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the negotiated
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
fix for this originally infor House Bill
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
436 passed the house with a veto proof
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
majority uh left the house in the
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
budget and uh we know
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
the chaos that ensued after that so The
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
house's policy on not
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
only a a partial fix but a full fix was
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much made loud and clear last
 
01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.590 align:start position:0%
pretty much made loud and clear last
last

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
year this is a and I want to reiterate
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
that this is very much a
 
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.669 align:start position:0%
that this is very much a
partial

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
partial
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
repair to what was ultimately done in
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 436 so uh the guard
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
rails or the amendment that was
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
discussed that went through Edna was a
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
was actually proposed
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
by uh the the affected parties that's
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's the origin of it they they felt
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
that a guardrail would be welcome and
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
necessary not only just to drive the
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
cost down but
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
to um accomplish the ultimate goal here
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
which is to continue to have people
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
working and um try
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
to make the jobs in emergency services
 
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
to make the jobs in emergency services
more

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
attractive you know
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
the I am fully confident in saying this
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
is I is I have a relation ship with all
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
of these organizations that everyone
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
involved wants to see a prosperous and
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
healthy pension system that is universal
 
01:13:03.719 --> 01:13:05.990 align:start position:0%
healthy pension system that is universal
so

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so that's just really why I'm I'm
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
here before you today is just a little
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
bit of of a reminder of what we've gone
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
through in the past two years and just
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
kind of how we how we got to where we
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
are today with with that commission and
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
and um and I just would ask
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
the division one here to move this
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
through and and let's uh let's have some
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
positive change forward for the First
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
Responders you don't give yourself
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
enough credit this has been going on for
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
over a decade to try to get to this
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
point so I appreciate certainly the six
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
years I've been yeah involved um let's
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
just say I've been a little bit more
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
aggressive I appreciate I know we all
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your effort because it's been
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
a long road uh to get this far lot of
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
ups and downs
 
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
ups and downs
from

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
our battle to get this resolved um but
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
you got me here so go for it I'll take
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
the representative from
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
der representative Maguire you don't
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah no I don't want to
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
encourage that but you don't want to all
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
right I'll listen sure so
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming represent so
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
sure it seems to me that the key
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
difference between this and the and the
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
original House Bill
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
436 is that this expands the two and a
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
half% to be a available to younger uh
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
members of group two that's a fact yep
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I would you agree with me
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good feature of
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
this sure you
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
the when the when the legislature
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
created and or Consolidated the various
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
state pension systems in the'
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
60s um as you know the reason for that
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
was buying power in a lot of ways and
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
and uniformity amongst the various
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
groups and it took a few years and there
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
were some tweaks in the early days and
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
and they really got the system kind of
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
figured out where it can
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
function it's it's a cost-saving measure
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh based on Alternatives
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
and you know you kind of had to jostle
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
the the parameters to to get a good
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
running system and that system ran well
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
at 2 and A2 so you know to to restore
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
and I and I want to stress that for a
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
lot of folks it's a restoration and yes
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
for the newer folks it's it is a change
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
from their hiring condition but it is
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
putting the system basically back to
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
where it was functioning effectively
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
prior to the legislature messing with it
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the 90s so um you know we we bear
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
respons responsibility we I say as a
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
body not certainly as as members
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
individually the body but as a body we
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
bear responsibility in in mistakes that
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
were made in the past as well as some of
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
the lobbying organizations you know
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
pushing for some things that they didn't
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
fully understand so now that we have the
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
luxury of some 2020 vision and some
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
historical context to where we've made
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
some goof ups and and um you know we're
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're still kind of morphing this blob
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
that is the pension system into
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
something that frankly at some point I
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
hope we can just leave alone we can just
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
set it and let it do its thing but until
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
we get to that point we've got to work
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
our way through um getting back to to
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
that somewhat of a homeostasis type of a
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
operation and um within the financial
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
constraints of what we are able to do
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
based on the budgets that we have in
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
front of us so not to give some sort of
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
an Oxford level answer but that's that I
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
mean that's kind of where we are so um
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
this this is a step in the right
 
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
direction it's certainly not the step
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
that a lot of stakeholders want but you
 
01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
know when you do what you can when you
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
can right thanks Steve sure repres
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
add I think this is a commitment we we
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much made last year that we'd
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
address this issue seems to me the fair
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
thing to do at this
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
point are you moving the passage I'll
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
move the we pass
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
it it's been moved and seconded
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin followed by with
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
a second representative
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thanks slight more discussion
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome to discuss the
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you so um I had an
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
extensive discussion yesterday with uh
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate and um one of their big
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
concerns I mean just overall cost of
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill plus what we did with House
 
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.510 align:start position:0%
this bill plus what we did with House
Bill

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
436 is um the ongoing costs to
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities right so the if you look
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note I think it's about 4
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
million a year something and I just want
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
to stress to people that um that money
 
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.430 align:start position:0%
to stress to people that um that money
is

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
for the what we pay now the 53 million
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
um is and and you might want to amend
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
the bill right to to to the current
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note right rather than the amount
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's appropriated in the bill we might
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that for a minute but
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
but the my point is the the 4 million
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing that's for people who are are
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
not yet hired right and it's sort of
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
impossible to pay for them because we
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of them there will
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
be we don't know what they're going to
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
be paid Etc this is just our guess as to
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
what the ongoing costs will be and those
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
people get a better pension right they
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
get the 2 and a half% instead of the 2%
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
they do under current law and so it it's
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
sort of this ongoing cost is a concern
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the Spate but in some sense it's
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
impossible to pay for now right and so
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it's just you know it's one
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
of the characteristics you're going to
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
get a better pension it's going to cost
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more all right so then the
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
other part of the discussion is um we
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
saw from the new fiscal note that the
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
amount for the now part is a slightly
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
less because of the house Amendment so I
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
would suggest a friendly amendment to
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
this motion that we we put make the
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
note okay representative Griffin
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
supports that friendly Amendment
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is that seconded
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
Sweeny seeing no further discussion
 
01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
Sweeny seeing no further discussion
representative

01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
Wier well we have director Carl here I I
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
would have a question for
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
him as to what the deficit is now in the
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system and are we
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
making any progress on it um thanks uh
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative wer at the end of the
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year last June 30th it was
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
5.61 billion which was down from
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
569 billion in the prior year so there
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
was some uh movement downward uh based
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
on investment perform performance we
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
we've reached the point um in the
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
30-year funding of most of the liability
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
where the employer contributions coming
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
in now are reading into the principle
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a negative amortization
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the first you know decade or 10 12
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
years and that even though the employers
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
were paying the rates the the negative
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
amortization was increasing the
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
liability as well so we've kind of
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
crossed over to that Tipping Point so
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're eating into the principle more at
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
the current contribution rate so the
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
hope is barring any economic
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
catastrophes you know we that number
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
will be going
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
down thank you thank you
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
thanks there also another thing that
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
occurred to me if if the um
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities are upset about the extra
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
money and make it a 28a issue that
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps that percentage should be passed
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
employee

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
employee

Bill
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
1589 uh establishing a veterans
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
treatment Court this came out of the the
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee 18 to0 ought to pass
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
with Amendment passed on the house floor
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
with a Voice vote back on the 15th of
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
lean uh yes I was a prime sponsor of
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
this measure and as you mentioned it did
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
go through U Judiciary fairly easily
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
with as amended um I was really hoping
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Lynn Judge Lynn
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh who I spoke with earlier could be
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
here to speak to the measur as it came
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
committee um the uh the policy part of
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
it was what I focused on and uh in all
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
cander I didn't give a whole lot of
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
thought to the finance part and um I I
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
try to be pretty careful uh about
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
spending but uh and I know that's what
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
you all do so um the I can speak to the
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
policy um and I can try to I just re
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
reread the amended version and and there
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
are there is I had a little bit of
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
sticker shock actually looking at the
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
numbers that that that are there to put
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
this into place so anyway I'd be happy
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
to speak to the policy part of it a
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
little bit and um in the absence of
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn um but I'd be happy to try to
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
take any
questions

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we try to stick to uh Finance but
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
often we get off track but uh as far as
 
01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
policy have a bad lot over here but are
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
there any uh questions for
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative mofet representative
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
wer some of the earlier courts that we
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
did like the drug court and the family
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
court the family court I remember I was
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
involved with that we tried it for a
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years at a large count County
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
and a small County and see what the
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
acceptance was would you object if we
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
did this same kind of thing tried it
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
experimentally at a couple of counties
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
before we expanded it thank you for the
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
question and comment I would not object
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
to that I uh I know there's a template
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
in play that's been in place here to
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
kind of do that
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
combination uh thing you just described
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that did come up is
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
that there were some gaps that's why
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
this bill moved through Judiciary so my
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
only concern would be that that uh in
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
some fashion there no veterans uh
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
falling any gaps uh like in Grafton
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
County or Coos or whatever but uh what
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
you just what you just described uh it
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like something that could could
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
work at the drug drug court I think is
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
rocking County at the
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
drug at the drug court it started in a
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
couple of counties and the counties paid
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
for it because we were convinced yes
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea and it went on for
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
some time before it went Statewide and
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
then the state started to pay for it
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
before that it was a county budget so
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's another way to to try it to
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
you any further questions uh represent
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
mire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
representative we have in front of us a
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
a proposed amendment by representative
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
Stapleton um have you looked at that
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
because I I can't find any difference
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
between that and the and the the bill I
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
know representative Stapleton uh on the
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
house floor uh had an amendment that
 
01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.070 align:start position:0%
house floor uh had an amendment that
passed

01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that if I recollect
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
correctly had to do with making certain
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
folks eligible who were uh Allied
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
members of Alli forces who worked with
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
Americans uh so I I think that was the
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
point of his his uh amendment was to if
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
Allied uh military personnel who got
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
into trouble in New Hampshire they would
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
be eligible for this uh sentencing
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
option um so I think that's what
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's um Amendment
 
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's um Amendment
spoke

01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
to a question for Mr
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
Hoffman so the
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment we have before is stated
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
February 6 that that's the one that
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.830 align:start position:0%
passed the house
floor

01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe so yeah it's got
 
01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.830 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe so yeah it's got
these

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but so maybe he rote it because
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's there actually were two
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
amendments on this bill right so there
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
was the committee Amendment and the and
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
the floor amendment I guess yes
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire the the committee uh
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
changed the language in Committee in
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
then there was the floor Amendment which
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
we just uh representative Stapleton
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored that or put that in maybe this
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
is obsolute yes so we got to put an x on
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
the uh February 6 x x just because it
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay confuse the
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
issue sorry are there any further
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Mett yes oh

01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
chairman now um so the expensive part of
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
these grants to counties in what way
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
does this bill cause counties to spend
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
money uh thank you for the question and
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm looking over my shoulder to see if
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh Judge Lynn is here but but this young
 
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
uh Judge Lynn is here but but this young
woman

woman
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh is very familiar with the uh
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
judicial the inner workings and hidden
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of our judicial
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
processes uh and I'm U more I'm a word
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
person not num person but uh in terms of
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
the structure you just spoke to uh uh
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
she or judge or representative Lynn
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
could um being part of that judge world
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
could answer it better than me well
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn who's used to be
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
part of the judge world just came in so
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
would you like to come there's been some
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions that representative Moffett
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
said you're the person to ask represent
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
ly here I'm so pleased
 
01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
so uh so I I I uh I spoke to I
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
introduced this uh representative ly and
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
I we're not really into the policy part
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
but the mechanism of uh in fact
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
represent wer had a interesting good
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
question comment that maybe he could
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
repeat for you sure and I I apologize
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
for being late I we had our exec
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
sessions going on and we just just got
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
done sorry about that no I was referring
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
implementation um like in Family Court
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
first we tried it in a large County and
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
a small County for a couple of years
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
years before we decided whether or not
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
it was successful and to expand it and
 
01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
then with the drug court I know we
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
started in Rockingham County we were
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
convinced by the county attorney that we
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
should try it and it was paid for just
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
by the county and then I think another
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
County had had done it and then it was
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
successful so the state took it over and
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
started paying for it so I'm wondering
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
if that same mechanism might work for
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
this I mean I I that certainly would be
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
a a Poss you mean you could do it that
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
way I think um the the way the way it's
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
drafted now doesn't do that and I think
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
the but what it does do is you'll see
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's language in there that gives the
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
the court system the flexibility so that
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
because I for example in let's say in
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
Coos County and might that's arguably
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
this could be true in other counties it
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
may be that the that the uh the number
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
of people the number of veterans who are
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
participating in a uh in the veterans
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
court would not be sufficient to you
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
know know uh have a sort of
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
separate uh judicial officer and staff
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
and stuff you know related just to that
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
County so this gives them gives the uh
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
the court system the flexibility to say
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
well we're going to combine Coos and
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
Grafton uh or whatever um but I I guess
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say and I and
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
I'd be if interested what the judicial
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
branch would have to say because they
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
obviously have more recent information
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
than I do my sense though is that these
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
treatment oriented courts the drug court
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
mental health um even the veterans I
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean there is some language in existing
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
law dealing with veterans courts um you
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
know it's been around sort of long
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
enough for us to kind of know that it
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
works and so I you know the pilot the
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
pilot program model I think I'm not sure
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
we need to do that anymore so that's I
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
guess that would be what I would say on
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.310 align:start position:0%
guess that would be what I would say on
that

01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
Mett or representative Lynn
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire has a question
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you um
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
um let me ask the question I um asked
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
previously so the main cost of this bill
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the grants to counties in what way
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
did the does the bill impose new C new
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
costs on
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
counties well I think in terms of the
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
you know um the the County correctional
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
systems for example uh they uh they
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing people uh some of those things
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
are paid for by the county and I assume
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
um things that they would do in
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
connection with the drug court um I mean
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
in connection with the veterans court
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
that would uh cost money you know at
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
least or at least things that they could
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
do that could cost money that and that's
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think maybe what the the idea of
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
having the grants is to is to uh make
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
them available to so that if so that if
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
there are treatment options that they
 
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
could uh that they could that they could
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
Implement they would have money to do
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
that and I wish you know I'm I'm is Alex
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
is Alex Cassel here not he's not I wish
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I wish Alex was here because
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
he's he's kind of our the judicial
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
Branch's Guru on these on the treatment
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh course and he could he could give you
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
the the specific examples of things that
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
the counties do now in the other
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
treatment courts that I'm you know I'm
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't have the details and I
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for that may I follow so
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the judge might order that somebody
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
go through drug treatment or something
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
like that and the county would pay the
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
the treatment person for that
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
service that what we're the county I
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean that that as an example or they
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
um uh for example I I as I I give you
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
just an example I understand that in
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County which I'm you know I
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
have some more familiarity with they um
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
the County House of
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections does some out of House of
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections um provide some out of House
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
of Correction services to um either
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
former or or deferred inmates uh in
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
terms of counseling and drug treatment
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing and so I suspect
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be the kind of thing for
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
veterans that um count you know that
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
counties might do and would be um and
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would be something that the
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
counties would pay for and presumably
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
this grant money would be available to
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know to help them in that regard so
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
I think that's U that's sort of the idea
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about but in terms
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
of you know exactly what exactly what
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
you call that person and you know the
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
exact duties I'm I I I have to say I
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't really
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
know one more one more so the the fiscal
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
node says we're we're looking at an
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing cost because this grant thing is
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
not just one time this is every year and
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
so the ongoing cost looks like $2
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
million a year
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
and so um and it says there's a pilot
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
program that has 12 individuals in it
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
and it takes up one quarter of one
 
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.189 align:start position:0%
and it takes up one quarter of one
judge's

01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
judge's
 
01:43:32.199 --> 01:43:34.830 align:start position:0%
judge's
time

01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
um is this two million a year I mean do
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
we expect do you know how many um
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
individuals we expect to help with this
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
and you know what's what would be like
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
per kind of thing do we have any idea
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
about that representative mfet I'm in
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the numbers I'm I'm really
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
not I I don't have a good feel for that
 
01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you for the question
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative in terms of numbers
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's just no way we can project how
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
many veterans are going to get in
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
trouble or might be eligible for this
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
program uh I don't have the current
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
numbers in terms of like last year the
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
previous year the number of veterans who
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
were uh referred to drug court uh that
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
would give us some sort of a Baseline uh
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
great question and and it's somewhat
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
indeterminable thank you know the other
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I say is um I I
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
completely understand your concern I
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if you know
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean if if I guess I would speaking
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
for myself and I I haven't talked to
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Mofford about this but I
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you you know decide well look let's
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
let's sort of see how this works in
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the money let's let's let's say
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
that you know we're going to appro rate
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
this money uh uh for for next year or
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
whatever and and have some language in
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
there that says you know this will be
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
reevaluated um at the end of the at the
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year or whatever that
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
I mean that makes perfect sense I would
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have any problem with that
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank seeing no further questions thank
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
you I do see a gentleman from the uh
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
National Guard in the back there I
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
believe would you like to come forward
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
 
01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
yeah

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah we we do have an updated
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it seems a lot higher
 
01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
than the original bill that went to the
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee so I'll be curious
 
01:45:49.629 --> 01:45:49.639 align:start position:0%
and why it's now closing in on $2
 
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
million the I think the the major cost
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
there is it's in the original language
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
the actual grants themselves and my
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of the grant Amounts is
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
that that those are amounts that are
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
used in the drug courts and so I think
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
the I don't want to speak for the the
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
policy sponsors but their thought was
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
that it would be unlikely to exceed the
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
amount of funds that are used in the
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
county grants for the drug courts um and
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that's true and it's it's
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
also not very likely certainly not
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
initially to approach the amount of
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
money that's used uh for the grants for
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
the drug courts uh I don't know if their
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
intention they can maybe speak more to
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
it as just to Envision what I know many
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
Advocates of the bill have said they
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
expect to be able to pull many more
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
people into the program than are
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
currently in it uh that they didn't want
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
it to have a a ceiling that was too low
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh for a future date but I don't expect
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the grants would reach the total uh
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
maximum that's currently listed in this
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill the direct costs for the court are
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
relatively low the bill has a veterans
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
court coordinator that's a hiring of a
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
position the creation of a database to
 
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
answer record questions and a certain
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of our grant manager time the
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
same way that she manages the grants
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
through the drug court to manage them uh
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
through the counties but the the the
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
grants themselves are not a cost to us
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're a pass through for them the
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
costs for the court are under a quarter
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars a
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
year I should have asked you this at the
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
beginning if you just state your name
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the record soone outside there knows
 
01:47:17.589 --> 01:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
who I should assume everybody knows me
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
by my face uh my name is eron k I'm the
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial branch
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Warren Perry I'm the deputy
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
agent general for the Department of
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services so
 
01:47:31.229 --> 01:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
I would just kind of say that the demand
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the court for veterans court services
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
we anticipate to be less than 40 a year
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
historically we generally have about 12
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
or 14 in the program at any given time
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
so to uh to kind of get after uh
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's question I
 
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
don't think there'll be a huge demand
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
for this but I I think there's a there's
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
there could be an anticipated increase
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
in demand if we establish a complete
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
veterans court right now there's a
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
docket inside the mental health courts
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
that that Services veterans that's kind
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the pilot that uh representative wer
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
talked about and we've been doing that
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years and that's where
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers come from so at any given
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
time about 12 maybe 40 veterans a year
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
might come in contact and that could
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
swell if we expand this to all the
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
courts in the state so that's kind of
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say would you take
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
questions as many as I can answer all
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
right represent Maguire yeah thank you
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um yeah this more a question
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
for Miss krian I think
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
um since we don't know how many people
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
are involved the way the the way I read
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is the grants are only
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
pro-rated based on the the portion of
 
01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
the year uh that the grant will be
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
effective and it's so much for this kind
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
of County and so much for that kind of
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
County it's not based on the usage in
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
the sense of how many veterans were were
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
having these kind of cases so would it
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
be make more sense for us to say um
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
veterans cases and and $10,000 a case or
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know some kind of
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
number I don't think that the the courts
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a perspective on that it it is low
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment right now and and that's one
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the things we've appreciated working
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors that they specifically
 
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
inserted language in the bill that would
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
be clear that we would have some options
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
if we had the county where for example
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
there was only one or two participants
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the court at a given time uh you know
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
from the Court's perspective I don't
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
think that this is we just a pass
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
through for this money the counties may
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
have more of a of a view on what is
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
efficient for them to receive it and uh
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
but for us it would not make a
 
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
difference if it were structured that
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
way because we would solely use our
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
grants manager to transfer that money to
 
01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:45.870 align:start position:0%
grants manager to transfer that money to
the

01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
counties um one question yeah so since
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're the attorney here um it seems to
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
me that uh on page four line 33 is in
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
conflict with um page one line three so
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
page one line three says at least one
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
veterans court shall be established in
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
one circuit court and one Superior Court
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
in each County or
 
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
District um are districts some counties
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
have more than one district is that one
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
District Court yes there are 34 district
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
courts okay um and uh but the on the P
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
page four line 33 it says a county
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
seeking to implement a veterans court
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
May obtain a grant right so we're
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
telling them they must implement it and
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
then um they may get a grant you know
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
seeking to implement right so it sort of
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
that implies that maybe they don't want
 
01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.790 align:start position:0%
that implies that maybe they don't want
to

01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
implement what do you think that's a
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
good question I think that the the
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
Mandate is for the courts to to
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
establish um the the veterans court and
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
I think if we didn't have the county
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
participation and they didn't want to
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
get grants and they didn't want to bring
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
some of their resources to it the
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
Court's role is to provide the judge the
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
clerk that but there's a paration a lot
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
of other folks uh you know prosecutors
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys uh treatment
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
professionals the VA uh so if we did not
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
have uh participation Beyond Court staff
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
that would certainly uh limit the
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the program it would be
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
much more simp ilar to a traditional
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication um so I I I but I I take
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
that language to be on the courts
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
already now we do try to have a veterans
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
track where we have subscribership and
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
they have varying levels of formality
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's relatively formal in
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester and nashaa where there's a
 
01:51:40.109 --> 01:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
high population there's a lower level of
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
formality in a couple other locations
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
with a small number of folks um so I I
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that for us our view is our
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the legislation is
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we have to make sure that this is
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
available regardless of the geographic
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
setting in which the veteran finds
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
themselves but that may mean pulling
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
them into another District somehow for
 
01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
example by video conferencing and that's
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
the line that was inserted at our
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
request immediately after the
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to establish so you could
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
theoretically have a county that didn't
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
participate and the veteran would have
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
to go to another County it would have to
 
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
be served by a video conference through
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
another location um but it this would be
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
a much less effective Bill if we did not
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.589 --> 01:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
counties are there further questions
 
01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:25.950 align:start position:0%
counties are there further questions
representative

01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
eil thank you for coming I I don't know
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you're the right person to ask this
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
did the association of counties testify
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
or have a position that you're aware of
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm afraid I don't know the
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
answer to that yeah I'm you're probably
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
the wrong person sorry I don't recall at
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
the public hearing seeing
 
01:52:45.629 --> 01:52:45.639 align:start position:0%
them no
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
don't

01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I had a question for Miss
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
krian so I see that there's a special
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
fund that's a special account that would
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
be set up separate from the judicial
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
branch now with the drug courts that was
 
01:53:10.109 --> 01:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
all rolled into the judicial budget and
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
why would there be a need for a special
 
01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
why would there be a need for a special
account

01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
for this program that's not something
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a position on if the
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislature would like to structure that
 
01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
differently it's not an area where we
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
sawed change I think to the original
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
language of the bill uh we can
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
administer it either way but it's it's
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
not something in which we take a policy
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
position okay these are their cards oh
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay thanks are there any further
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone else would wish to
 
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone else would wish to
speak

01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
or sure
 
01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
you look familiar you've been here
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
before uh good afternoon my name's uh D
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
mcy I'm the deputy director of the
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
division of field services with the New
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections um
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
so I was asked to be here um listening
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh y sorry um so yes you want me to
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
start all over okay um I just wanted to
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
give a little background um obviously in
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
my role I've been in probation PR for 28
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
years as an officer Chief and now in my
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
current position worked with the drug
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
court um been involved in the startup of
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
like the youth adult uh Court um
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
obviously with the the veterans court we
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
we support all the specialty courts um
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in in all of those usually the
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
probation Pro officers are the ones who
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
are supervising these individuals
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
because usually they're on probation um
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know in like drug court drug court
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
cases uh youthful adult court cases um
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
those case loads are a lot more involved
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
with all the court
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
meetings uh other supervision type stuff
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to kind of echo what they
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
were saying I you know I work mostly as
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
a pro Pros are up North so I'm very
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with Coos Grafton Carol um you
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
know I don't see that uh those counties
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
probably having a dedicated veterans
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
court just because of the numbers um you
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
know typically we might have had two or
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
three indiv individuals who were
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
veterans under supervision certainly the
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
larger counties would probably have a
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
dedicated veteran court if that's what
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
comes to pass and I saying that there
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
was like maybe 20 or 40 uh individuals
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I think we all know Lake drug court
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
if you have a veterans court in Seven
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
Counties you're going to have a lot more
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
than 20 or 40 individuals funneled into
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
that um you know you're talking about
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and resources that would be
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
needed um certainly for the supervision
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
I would think the Department of
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
Corrections would
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
need additional officers to handle this
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
type of endeavor um so you know kind of
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
like in drug court best practices are
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
one officer to 20 to 25 cases and that's
 
01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:13.639 align:start position:0%
what we've try to do with drug court um
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a a need for this but
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't see it going Statewide or
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
having you know you might like she she
 
01:56:25.229 --> 01:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
was testifying saying that you know
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
you'd have people reporting from Lebanon
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
say to maybe lonia or Sullivan counties
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
for those areas where there was only one
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
or two people in these types of Courts
 
01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
um but I think you know it would
 
01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
definitely be
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh an additional uh income resource
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
issue for the Department of Corrections
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
if you know we had 200 veteran courts
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
individuals placed on probation and
 
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
under our care so that may be something
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to consider as far as an
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
impact with this this kind of Bill and I
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
will certainly take any questions from
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
from any of
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
you other questions represent Maguire uh
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so can you answer
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
my question in terms of uh how much per
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual this bill adds to costs for
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
counties or get some idea or I'm I'm not
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be similar to the
 
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
drug court you know individuals um you
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if they do it per you
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
know I I I know like every county has
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know kind of a a cap of you know
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
Coos has 10 you know other areas may
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
have 50 I mean I think that's how they
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
base the Appropriations to fund it you
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
know because you have a a drug cour
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
coordinator or a veterans court
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator and you know the team that
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
does all the treatment so I think that's
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
probably how it would be broke down I'm
 
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
sure sure if you you know like Mr
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
casselle Alex probably has a breakdown
 
01:57:59.709 --> 01:57:59.719 align:start position:0%
on you know we in Rockingham we have
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
this many cases and this is what we a
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
lot for that uh program all right one
 
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
one followup now you said that um this
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
adds cost to the Department of
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections and I I don't quite
 
01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:15.639 align:start position:0%
understand that because absent the drug
 
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
the the veterans court aren't these
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
veterans they've committed whatever
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
crime they commit and they're in your
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
charge and you know you still have to
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
deal with them and so on yes I would say
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
most likely they would be on probation
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
regardless if there wasn't a veteran
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
Court the difference is the amount of
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
time energy effort resources that these
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
cases take like a drug court case
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
probably takes three times the amount of
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
time energy resources from the
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections as far as
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with those there's weekly Court
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
meetings there's daily uh Communications
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's increas
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
supervision um so as far as a resource
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department of cors that's why
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
we've tried to increase in drug
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
court to the most that we can as a
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
department but what I'm saying is if you
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
have 200 veteran Court uh individuals in
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
these programs Statewide I'm not sure we
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
would be able to absorb that without
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
additional probation Pro officers
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
keeping up with all the other stuff that
 
01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:24.510 align:start position:0%
keeping up with all the other stuff that
we're

01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
doing well you just got a homework
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
assignment if you could get together
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the LBA Mr Hoffman and U look at
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
the impact this would have on the
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections before next
 
01:59:42.189 --> 01:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions we'll
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
take this up next Wednesday when we meet
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully I think we're at about six
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
bills now for next
 
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.589 align:start position:0%
bills now for next
week

01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah sure if I make one
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
comment I I just would like to highlight
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony in the policy
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee about cost right so and I
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
think this is what representative
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire was getting at it's like it
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
costs a certain amount of money to to
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerate Veterans and it cost a
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money to run through a
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
veteran's track and what we really need
 
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
to be focusing on maybe which one is
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
cheaper and more cost effective I would
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
AR without doing the math I would argue
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
that it's cheaper to use the alternative
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
sentencing methods and the the the
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
potential impacts of recidivism and
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
getting a productive member of the
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
community back in the community who is a
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
veteran are cheaper than incarceration
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
so I just would make that point to the
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
committee as as a consider the bill uh
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
and and move forward so I just we think
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
it's a good program from the from the
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
depart from our Department's perspective
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
we do understand that there's costs
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
associated with it but we think the
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
costs are less than if we had to
 
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerate veterans
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
well hopefully by next Wednesday we'll
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
have that well everybody will be happy
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
results thanks Mr Hoffman for doing that
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh seeing no further
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh it's almost 12:00 we'll be
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
back here at 1 p.m.

waiting for one I'm not sure how much it
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
will change but all right thanks
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
Mike all right all yours good morning Mr
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
03:07:42.389 --> 03:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
the record Josh Elliot I am the director
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the division of policy and programs
 
03:07:46.190 --> 03:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy um which is
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
where this uh position and this reformed
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
office uh are located um so I am here to
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that um
 
03:07:59.670 --> 03:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill if I recall you're not General
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
funded at all right that is correct um
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
we are a mix of either federal funds
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
assessment dollars from the utilities we
 
03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
regulate um or um the renewable energy
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
fund which is where this office would be
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
funded out of other questions represent
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:08:20.229 --> 03:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
for coming you said this will be
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy funds where does those
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
come from sure um so the renewable thank
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question the renewable
 
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
energy fund um is a uh continually
 
03:08:31.229 --> 03:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated non-aps fund um that is
 
03:08:33.550 --> 03:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
managed by the department of energy the
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
funding from uh for the renewable energy
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
fund comes from what are called
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments um
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
essentially in State Statute we have
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
What's called the renewable portfolio
 
03:08:46.349 --> 03:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
standard or RPS um uh electric
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities so eversource
 
03:08:50.349 --> 03:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
Unitil Etc or competitive energy
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
suppliers are required to purchase what
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
are called renewable energy certificates
 
03:08:57.870 --> 03:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
or wrecks in order to meet those um
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements um to have a
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of from various
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
renewable um
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
resources to cover what they sell in any
 
03:09:08.910 --> 03:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
given year in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
um if a um entity can not purchase
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
because there are not Recs available to
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
be purchased on the open market or they
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason choose not to um
 
03:09:19.950 --> 03:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
they can make essentially what is a
 
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
penalty payment called an alternative
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
compliance payment so essentially
 
03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
instead of going out and purchasing
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
those renewable energy certificates they
 
03:09:29.349 --> 03:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
say okay I'm going to pay essentially
 
03:09:32.830 --> 03:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
this penalty instead um those penalties
 
03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
then go into the renewable energy fund
 
03:09:36.269 --> 03:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
which fund a variety of activities and
 
03:09:39.389 --> 03:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
is contemplated as funding this
 
03:09:42.910 --> 03:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
position one followup so as I if I'm
 
03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:44.429 align:start position:0%
position one followup so as I if I'm
right

03:09:44.429 --> 03:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:09:48.429 --> 03:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
um any leftover renewable energy money
 
03:09:52.110 --> 03:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
goes back to ratee payers right and so
 
03:09:55.389 --> 03:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
is that am I right or um you're thinking
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking of Reggie you're
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
thinking of Reggie yes so these funds
 
03:10:00.190 --> 03:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
come to the department we are then um
 
03:10:02.469 --> 03:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
statutorily required um we have a number
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
of programs to fund renewable um uh
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
either rebates or um competitive Grant
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
programs so they go to a variety of
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
things whether it's um installing a a
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
pellet boiler at someone's home to doing
 
03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
community solar projects and sort of
 
03:10:19.229 --> 03:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
everything in between
 
03:10:22.830 --> 03:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
so follow so so therefore if this
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
position's funded and it's a new
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
position there's something else that's
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
losing out a little bit is that right it
 
03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
so the amount of alternative compliance
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
payments fluctuates in a given year
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
because there are other Market forces as
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
well as actions taken by other uh New
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
England states in terms of the wreck
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
market so it's a very Dynamic Market um
 
03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that's not to say that we would um
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
not fund it or I should say that um by
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
adding this position doesn't necessarily
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
mean that somebody wouldn't get a grant
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
it are there any further questions Magic
 
03:11:03.630 --> 03:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
Money representative wer thank you Mr
 
03:11:06.990 --> 03:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
chair I've been told that the uh sebr
 
03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant produces enough
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
electricity to power the whole state but
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
ISO New England has decided to spread it
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
all over New England is that any truth
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
to that it's so C Brook Nuclear Station
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
which is owned by uh nextera is a
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
private company um so they are they are
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
merch we're called Merchant generators
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
so essentially they can sell their
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
electricity to whomever is the purchaser
 
03:11:30.990 --> 03:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
of that electricity um so they don't
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
have any sort of statutory requirements
 
03:11:34.750 --> 03:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
or federal requirements that they only
 
03:11:36.429 --> 03:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
sell electricity to within the state
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
boundaries um so in theory if somebody
 
03:11:40.469 --> 03:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
has a contract whether it's a utility uh
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
or other entity to buy that electricity
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
from cab Brook that is how they sell
 
03:11:46.429 --> 03:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
their electricity thank you you're
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
welcome uh representative Wy got me
 
03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
thinking a little bit so what's the
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
lifetime left on
 
03:11:53.439 --> 03:11:55.429 align:start position:0%
lifetime left on
SE

03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
SE
 
03:11:58.349 --> 03:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe and I am not I would be
 
03:11:59.630 --> 03:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with the committee on
 
03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
this I know they recently renewed their
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
license with um the
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
NRC um I believe it's out to 2050
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
something at this point um I'd be happy
 
03:12:11.950 --> 03:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
to follow up with the committee with the
 
03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
exact date all right thanks so much
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%

would you like to say

03:12:51.790 --> 03:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
representa El for the record my name is
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh Representative Keith Ammon Hillsboro
 
03:12:59.309 --> 03:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
District 42 uh and I'll submit a pink
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
card when I'm done um I was down you
 
03:13:03.750 --> 03:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
guys missed an exciting caucus if you
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
weren't in there that's why I was late
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize so uh this bill uh was
 
03:13:12.910 --> 03:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
a product of the nuclear the advanced
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
nuclear study uh commission uh and and I
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of chairing ing that
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and in our research we went through
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
statutes so we have this whole statute
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
set of statutes on atomic energy and
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're ancient they're they're very
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
ancient statutes and in the statutes uh
 
03:13:34.510 --> 03:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
by anually so every two
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
years um one of the department heads was
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be appointed the coordinator
 
03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
of atomic energy development and that
 
03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
whoever that was was supposed to every
 
03:13:48.670 --> 03:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
years create
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
reports in conjunction with many of the
 
03:13:52.590 --> 03:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
other Departments of the of the
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
executive branch and present those
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
reports to the governor and the
 
03:13:59.469 --> 03:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
executive Council so that's existing
 
03:14:02.070 --> 03:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
statute that's completely being ignored
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
so we thought it was a good uh a good uh
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know effort to update our statutes
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
with current
 
03:14:10.910 --> 03:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
language so we didn't seem like we were
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
living in the
 
03:14:14.429 --> 03:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
50s and then also resurrect that
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
position to sort of carry on the work
 
03:14:19.550 --> 03:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
that our study commission had been doing
 
03:14:21.309 --> 03:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
and put that position under the
 
03:14:22.750 --> 03:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy which is which
 
03:14:24.190 --> 03:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
didn't exist you know when when the
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
statute was written so that was sort of
 
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
the thinking of it and then we had
 
03:14:32.429 --> 03:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
experts come in from um you know the
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
different different organizations like
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
the nuclear energy Institute and the
 
03:14:40.910 --> 03:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
American nuclear Society we had um
 
03:14:44.590 --> 03:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
Federal um we had people from the the
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
office of nuclear energy from the
 
03:14:48.269 --> 03:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that came in and
 
03:14:50.429 --> 03:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
and helped us and one of the suggestions
 
03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
was we want to put the definition I know
 
03:14:54.429 --> 03:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
this isn't a policy committee but I'm
 
03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
giving you the background we wanted to
 
03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
put the definition of advanced nuclear
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
into our statutes and then include that
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
that consideration in this reporting
 
03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
requirement and we tied it the
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to tie that definition to
 
03:15:12.670 --> 03:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
the federal definition of advanced
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear so that's kind of the whole
 
03:15:17.229 --> 03:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
point of the original bill was to start
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
looking at Advanced nuclear because C
 
03:15:21.790 --> 03:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
Brook and I think I think I heard the
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
same number 2050 it's been extended to
 
03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
it may be extended further um but we
 
03:15:29.309 --> 03:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
know we have high energy costs and
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear these are these are
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
Generation 3 plus and generation four
 
03:15:38.510 --> 03:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
designs that are they're they're the
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
idea is they'd be built in a factory
 
03:15:42.830 --> 03:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
delivered by a truck assembled in a few
 
03:15:46.590 --> 03:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
months that their their safety perimeter
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
just the site boundary it doesn't have
 
03:15:52.189 --> 03:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be 10 mil in radius they don't
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
require a lot of water they can power a
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
municipality for eight years before
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
being refueled so there's some really
 
03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
cool promises that are on the horizon
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
potentially and we want to make sure we
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
send out the signal that our state is
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
aware we're interested we're looking at
 
03:16:08.429 --> 03:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
it and for to
 
03:16:12.429 --> 03:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
have um there are about a
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
hundred that it's somewhere
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
around uh let let's say about almost 10
 
03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
billion of venture capital federal money
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
going into exploring this new
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
technology um I'm trying to remember all
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
my stats there's something like 40
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
companies working on it we have a
 
03:16:32.189 --> 03:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
startup right here in
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh called star cube that's
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
working on it so so that was the the
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
idea behind the bill um and then the
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh amended it to change the
 
03:16:45.229 --> 03:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
name of the office of offshore wind
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
development to be more generic
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
for energy Innovation so that would
 
03:16:52.110 --> 03:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
cover Advanced nuclear it would cover
 
03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
hydrogen battery storage that kind of
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
thing so and uh I thought that made
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
sense and I agreed to it because uh with
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
inflation there's a lot of contracts for
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
offshore wi that are being cancelled uh
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
the costs are prohibitive so um for now
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
that may be a dead end so to repurpose
 
03:17:13.950 --> 03:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh commission makes sense to
 
03:17:16.030 --> 03:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
me so happy to answer any questions
 
03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
questions like obviously you did a good
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
job so thank you for com you have
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
something else to add I was going to say
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
I know the Department's neutral on this
 
03:17:32.349 --> 03:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
um we had had discussions with um uh
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner uh Elms and some
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
others and um my opinion is that they're
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
favorable towards the direction that
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is going but I don't want to
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
speak for
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
them I guess I do have one question I
 
03:17:51.070 --> 03:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
saw there was a reference to class to
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
money what's that
 
03:17:57.550 --> 03:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
do I don't know okay yeah the bill makes
 
03:17:59.550 --> 03:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
reference I I guess is it the is the
 
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or yeah so I haven't seen
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
the revised fiscal note
 
03:18:08.269 --> 03:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay are you like to I just i' never saw
 
03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
eye

03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
eye
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
sure um having to answer that question
 
03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh class two um refers to the class uh
 
03:18:24.990 --> 03:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
classes within the renewable portfolio
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
standard so class two is solar um so
 
03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
there are other requirements that the
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
money that we get in for acps be
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
directed towards solar activities
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
specifically within the statute um so
 
03:18:37.469 --> 03:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's where that um comes in I
 
03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
will answer your other question uh
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
regarding SE Brook station um I did look
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
it up while um representative Ammon was
 
03:18:44.670 --> 03:18:44.680 align:start position:0%
testifying uh their license was renewed
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to operate through March 15 of
 
03:18:50.189 --> 03:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
2050 all
 
03:18:53.950 --> 03:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
right I guess you don't have any yeah
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
sounds good all right thanks so much for
 
03:18:58.269 --> 03:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
your thank
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
you all right representa Sweeny's moving
 
03:19:04.590 --> 03:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I will move on to pass and
 
03:19:07.950 --> 03:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
Griffin was supposed to be
 
03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
Griffin was supposed to be
representative

03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
cell oh you already had that set up I
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
see he's one of the sponsors yeah that's
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
why I
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.640 --> 03:20:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
Griffin

03:20:15.630 --> 03:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:25.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
not to jump to 1649 but did you have an
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
amendment for that danan uh no not not
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
not at this time oh okay so I thought if
 
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
there was I got a lot of questions about
 
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
the bill but okay well I thought if you
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
if you had an amendment we could pass it
 
03:20:41.950 --> 03:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
out and look at it before we start I I
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
handed I did have a handout uh so I I
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
already handed out the one thing right
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
which was the summary of the the
 
03:20:52.110 --> 03:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
computer generated summary of the
 
03:20:54.309 --> 03:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
previous public hearing yeah and work
 
03:20:57.070 --> 03:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
sessions but I have more copies in case
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
people in the audience might like to
 
03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:03.070 align:start position:0%
people in the audience might like to
read

03:21:03.070 --> 03:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
it just they don't exactly tell the
 
03:21:08.319 --> 03:21:15.550 align:start position:0%
it just they don't exactly tell the
story

03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:45.510 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
1649 relative to prohibiting certain
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
products um receiving PFS and I believe
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
this went to the Commerce Committee and
 
03:30:57.189 --> 03:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
came out what 8 8 to three no 16 to
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
three 16 to three 16 to three ought to
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
pass and on the floor it passed on a
 
03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote that's right and just um
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman for the
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
record my name is Karen Eble and I
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
represent maram uh District 9 which is
 
03:31:13.870 --> 03:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
New London and Newbury and just for
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
further clarification on The Voice vote
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
this wasn't one that we needed uh any
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
clarification on it was unanimous but
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
for a couple of voices in the background
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
so it was uh very forcefully um
 
03:31:30.429 --> 03:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
supported as I of course believe it
 
03:31:33.150 --> 03:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
should be I didn't hear your voice Dan I
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
was listening um uh it's difficult to
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
express I think how much uh passion um
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
supports this bill and how much input uh
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
was um given on it and how much work has
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
been done frontes representative money
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you can sit with the Karen if
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
you'd like I know you're very involved
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
in this a while yeah it's okay sure um
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
but it's also it's um it's very
 
03:32:06.910 --> 03:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to talk about the
 
03:32:10.189 --> 03:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
financial um note fiscal note without
 
03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
also giving some kind of background on
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
03:32:18.670 --> 03:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
issue I think we're all very
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable at this point about St
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
gobain and the impact that it has had on
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
the um on the towns immediately
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
surrounding it's not as well understood
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
what the impact of p is on our um on our
 
03:32:37.150 --> 03:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
waist stream which is something that I'm
 
03:32:40.269 --> 03:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in and the first
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
thing that I've given to you in your
 
03:32:45.550 --> 03:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
packets so you can just look at it is
 
03:32:48.990 --> 03:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
that the sources of pasas um from
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
products setting aside industry the
 
03:32:56.110 --> 03:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
pasas bearing products end up in our
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
landfills the landfill leachate of
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
course comes out it has pasas in it the
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh lee8 and I've given you a sheet here
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of millions of
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
landfill leachate has to be processed by
 
03:33:15.309 --> 03:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
our wastewater treatment plants the
 
03:33:17.469 --> 03:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
waste water treatment plants at this
 
03:33:21.550 --> 03:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
point have no uh testing requirements
 
03:33:25.389 --> 03:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
for past when the uh Wastewater after
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's been processed is released into our
 
03:33:30.710 --> 03:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
surface waters the wastewater treatment
 
03:33:34.110 --> 03:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
plants uh a lot of the residual is
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
sludge that contains some of the past
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
the pasas goes right back in the sludge
 
03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
goes back into the landfills again many
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
of you may have heard about sludge that
 
03:33:49.389 --> 03:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
has been um land applied in the past uh
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
that had p in Maine it was a huge
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
problem because it actually ended up
 
03:33:57.389 --> 03:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
contaminating dairy cattle and dairy
 
03:34:00.990 --> 03:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
farms had to be taken offline and
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
basically it it's it's bankrupted them
 
03:34:07.389 --> 03:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
much of the land applied uh sludge in
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is actually
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
treated and is called uh biosolids so
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
that should not have p in it it is
 
03:34:15.279 --> 03:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
that should not have p in it it is
treated

03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
treated
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
but the point is that the wastewater
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and we know what an
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
investment we've made in wastewater
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
treatment plants in this state um are
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
having to deal with untold amounts of uh
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
of Wastewater and the sludge is going by
 
03:34:34.590 --> 03:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
the tons and tons and someone from waste
 
03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
management is here that can perhaps talk
 
03:34:39.870 --> 03:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
to this but Millions uh you know a lot
 
03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
of tonnage going back into the landfills
 
03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
bearing pasas and then you know who
 
03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
knows there's the leech Aid again the
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
other thing uh just to keep in mind is
 
03:34:52.750 --> 03:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
that about 80% of us have independent
 
03:34:55.630 --> 03:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
septic systems in the state most of us
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
have um a cocktail of p in our bodies
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
and it ends up in the uh septic tanks
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
and in our leech Fields the septic tanks
 
03:35:08.910 --> 03:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
gets pumped and then that goes to the
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants as well and
 
03:35:14.670 --> 03:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
then lastly but definitely not least is
 
03:35:17.550 --> 03:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
the drinking water water uh facilities
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we had a um support from the
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water utilities for this have
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
had to spend excruciating amounts of
 
03:35:29.910 --> 03:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
money to upgrade their facilities to be
 
03:35:33.630 --> 03:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
testing for p in the trillionth I have
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
not brought information here on the
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
health effects of past um whether you
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
agree with that or not the fact of the
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
matter is that we are testing the water
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
and just about everything else for past
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the trillionth and we're having to um
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're having to treat it and it's
 
03:35:54.510 --> 03:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive in fact the state of
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has probably already
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
invested hundred
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
million and um there's really no end in
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
site one thing that I gave to you is an
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
article that I got from the Minnesota
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control agency they estimate
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
remediation of past in the future will
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
be 14 to 20 8
 
03:36:20.830 --> 03:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
billion and they also have information
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
here that says although pasas can be
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
bought for 50 to ,000 per pound the
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
remediation costs are 2.7 million to $18
 
03:36:34.110 --> 03:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
million per pound to remove and Destroy
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
them from Municipal Wastewater which is
 
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount of money by
 
03:36:42.510 --> 03:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
anybody's standard another thing that I
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
have in your packet um I just want want
 
03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
you to see this is from the
 
03:36:52.469 --> 03:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
USGS and this shows that all over the
 
03:36:55.150 --> 03:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
state they have tested the soil for
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
pasas and while not all of it exceeds
 
03:37:01.030 --> 03:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
the amounts that are concerning it's
 
03:37:04.750 --> 03:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
literally everywhere and if you
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
um if you think that the products that
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
you're using that contain P aren't
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
contributing to the situation um I
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
you're wrong wrong because most of
 
03:37:21.389 --> 03:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
everything you can imagine has p in it
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I want to say also that this bill
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
came out of the solid waste working
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
group that I chair and it's a
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group that includes uh Solid
 
03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
Waste processing folks
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and representative from
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
the governor hospitals and they
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
uniformly supported the concept of
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
banning p in products uh for a lot of
 
03:37:52.830 --> 03:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
reasons but one of them is to reduce the
 
03:37:56.189 --> 03:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
toxicity in our waist string um I
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
haven't really spoken about the uh
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
Health costs that pasas can cause those
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
are really
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
unquantifiable um I focused more on the
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
on the leachate and the Wastewater and
 
03:38:12.870 --> 03:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
the drinking water now I've spared you
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
the raft of support letters that I
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
brought into Commerce but this is unlike
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
any bill I think any of us have ever
 
03:38:25.630 --> 03:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
seen this is supported by the solid
 
03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
waste industry and I've given you um an
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
association letter from the national
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
waste and recycling Association so we
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
have landfill operators we have
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities that
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
also provided a letter in support

Advocates and the issue of pasas has
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
bring brought all these people together
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
in support and this is why when you look
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
at the recommendation of Commerce you
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
will see a 16-3 vote now I know that we
 
03:39:15.870 --> 03:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
have an AI replication of what happened
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
in the hearings what's not reflected
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
there is that the chairman asked on
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
several occasions for people to step
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward in the final analysis of the way
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
we in the way we uh amended the bill and
 
03:39:33.870 --> 03:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
no one said anything and that is because
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
during the process of amending it I
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
removed several parts of it that were
 
03:39:44.110 --> 03:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
onerous I thought for manufacturers and
 
03:39:47.309 --> 03:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
I removed them one was a notification
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
provision that all manufacturers that
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
produce products with past had to um
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
submit to the department this was also
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for the Department I also
 
03:40:00.670 --> 03:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
removed a uniform labeling requirement
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
which was onerous for
 
03:40:05.309 --> 03:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I also communicated with
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
several industry groups who were
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
concerned especially about the impact on
 
03:40:13.469 --> 03:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
um medical devices I provided an
 
03:40:16.750 --> 03:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
exclusion for that I also worked with
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
Honeywell and other businesses to
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
provide an exclusion for um products
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
that may include past but at a greatly
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
reduced level that still were much less
 
03:40:32.349 --> 03:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
onerous than for instance refrigerants
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
that are used at the time um so I can
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
stop there I I want to just talk though
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the manner in which
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
the products that I have uh banned in
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
this um
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill were selected it was
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
twofold one was because I communicated a
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
great deal with the waste processing
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
folks including waste management and the
 
03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
items that bear the biggest load in
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
landfills are bulky items like furniture
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
and carpet and uh that sort of thing so
 
03:41:11.150 --> 03:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that uh represented in the
 
03:41:15.389 --> 03:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
list that I have here secondly I have
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
data that shows where people are the
 
03:41:22.510 --> 03:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
most exposed themselves to pasas that's
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
Cosmetics that's food proc uh food
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
packaging um also carpet and so there's
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
that group and feminine hygiene products
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
and then lastly out of concern for our
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
children I've included juvenile products
 
03:41:43.389 --> 03:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
so that those will no longer have uh
 
03:41:45.790 --> 03:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
past for children 12
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
and under and I have PPE which I've
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
given you a letter from the professional
 
03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters they um are strong
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill so just jumping
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
ahead then to the fiscal
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
note um first of all it is I'm sorry to
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
say wrong um part of the way this bill
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
will be um
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
administered may include the
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
participation of the apartment in a
 
03:42:19.510 --> 03:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
Clearing House the way they um currently
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
participate in a clearing house for
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
mercury and for toxics and packaging
 
03:42:27.149 --> 03:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
toxics that don't include past by the
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
way um the numbers at the time were very
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
high they were
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect um and I actually communicated
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
directly with the executive director of
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
the Clearing House where a module would
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
be developed to deal with pasas for
 
03:42:47.550 --> 03:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
different states that are um that are
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
have banned or will be banning products
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
with um pasas in them the numbers are
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
far less and now because I've removed
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
the notification and the labeling
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions they're much much less and I
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe I haven't looked behind me yes
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
there he is director um whimet will
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
corroborate the fact that a new fiscal
 
03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
note is going to have to be prepared in
 
03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
connection with this um so really the
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
costs in here relate to one employee to
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
help um administer the program an
 
03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
employee that by the terms of the bill
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
is limited to five-year position um and
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee felt very
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
strongly that rather and I agree rather
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
than putting somebody into place uh for
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
an very extended period of time you want
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the person who is
 
03:43:49.469 --> 03:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
there is doing the job for which they
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
were hired and so we have the five-year
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
Proviso in there so that's fiveyear post
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
ban um the
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
$250,000 number that is in there is
 
03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
really to get the program up and running
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
and general Administration costs right
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
now for a for a manufacturer to uh
 
03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
provide a certificate of compliance if
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
one is requested there's no fee
 
03:44:16.030 --> 03:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
associated with it there will be other
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
education and administrative costs
 
03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so I also so you have the Minnesota
 
03:44:29.790 --> 03:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
example they're not unique uh the other
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
thing is that the state of New Hampshire
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
itself is in the middle of a big lawsuit
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
to try to get mitigation money back for
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
cost that it has um it has expanded and
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
if you read the complaint as I had every
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
reason you can imagine for Banning pen
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
products is right there in the um in the
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
complaint and as those of you on fiscal
 
03:44:56.670 --> 03:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
know there's a six-month report um that
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
has to be given to fiscal every year
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
which the most recent one I just read um
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
which I think was from December and
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
itself says that when you test
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater around the state um you will
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
find P at various levels and if you want
 
03:45:17.149 --> 03:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
to look at a map on the dees website for
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
testing for P I challenge you to find a
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
place where they haven't found it
 
03:45:26.349 --> 03:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
because it's like covered with with dots
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then the very last thing I think is
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
really important for this discussion I
 
03:45:33.510 --> 03:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
gave you a chart it's called State
 
03:45:37.229 --> 03:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
action on P it's from December of
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
2023 and as you can see all the states
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
that have banned past products in some
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
in some way and you can see the um
 
03:45:51.670 --> 03:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
effective dates of the bands and I was
 
03:45:54.269 --> 03:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
very careful in the selection of the
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
products that I've included here
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
including looking at what the landfill
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
operators are concerned about including
 
03:46:04.590 --> 03:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
where our direct exposure is to look at
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
what other states have done and the um
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
products that I've selected and the
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
effective date which um I hope we can
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about um all our
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
corroborate or go along with this and
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
also are beyond the effective dates of
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
these products California in particular
 
03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with um with the what's
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
going on with cosmetics and with apparel
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
so that will be helpful and then just in
 
03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion the impact P has had on this
 
03:46:45.189 --> 03:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
state it's hard to imagine another state
 
03:46:47.229 --> 03:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been impacted the way this
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
state has I'm really proud to say that
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
we've been a national leader on this the
 
03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
next step is to ban some products that
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
have P associated with them and um for a
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
time what I think compared to the magn
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
the huge amount of money we're expending
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
already and what we can look to in the
 
03:47:12.670 --> 03:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
future what I have in this bill is um is
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
small money and I'm really really
 
03:47:20.670 --> 03:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the finance committee will
 
03:47:24.149 --> 03:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
understand The Voice vote and the
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
passion and the um necessity the passion
 
03:47:31.229 --> 03:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
behind and the necessity for this bill
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll take your questions
 
03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:35.550 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll take your questions
representative

03:47:35.550 --> 03:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you did representative
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
Moody have to leave because I mean does
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
she want to speak first oh I was
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if she might want to speak
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.590 --> 03:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay I mean are you together kind of
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
or oh okay all right well I mean because
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get into lots of detail and
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
maybe I mean I'll I'll I'll be happy to
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
side and again just a reminder for our
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
friends we try to stick to the fiscal
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
matters versus the policy right since
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
the policy's already been approved by
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
the house M Mr chair I would say there
 
03:48:21.630 --> 03:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
are other people here that want to
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
testify is and and so I wouldn't want to
 
03:48:29.070 --> 03:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
time represent McGuire you had a
 
03:48:34.510 --> 03:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
question all right so I heard you say
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
that um you're you're primarily
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
concerned with water and and
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
Wastewater um but on page four lines uh
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
four and five um line four uh line three
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
um public the these those two things are
 
03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
are being exempt from characteristics of
 
03:49:00.510 --> 03:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
this bill well that makes sense Mr um
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire because let let
 
03:49:05.309 --> 03:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
me explain to you how that happened
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
first of all um utilities are not the
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
ones that are buying banned pro products
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
that would be banned under this bill but
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are having to um
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
work with it and they're the ones that
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
are going to have to upgrade their
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
facilities to deal with pasas the reason
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they're excluded was that the
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
utilities were very concerned that for
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
some reason someone might think the
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
sludge that they produce is a p added
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
product and it's not a p added product
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why we excluded
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
it really Qui
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
so but your point is you're trying to
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
keep stuff out of those systems right
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah well it won't be a uniform um
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe me it's not going to be 100%
 
03:50:00.030 --> 03:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
effective okay
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
um all
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
right so however your your little chart
 
03:50:10.149 --> 03:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
here about um past concentrations says
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
that landfill leech a is not a problem
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
by comparison to these other
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
it what it says uh representative is
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
that that is a chart of the exposure to
 
03:50:26.189 --> 03:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
human beings from landfill leachate
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's direct exposure so not a lot of
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
people have have that much direct
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
exposure to leee that chart has to do
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
with things that we are applying to our
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
bodies or
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
consuming and landfill leachate may
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
eventually be something that uh might
 
03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
get into drinking water or something
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
like that indirectly but that's what
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is right so my point is wouldn't we
 
03:50:53.790 --> 03:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
be better
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
off um keeping it out of drinking water
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
keeping it out of food as opposed to out
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
of carpet or out of something else but
 
03:51:07.510 --> 03:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that's the point in order to keep it
 
03:51:10.349 --> 03:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
out of water and to keep it out of waste
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
waterer and to keep it out of our
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
landfills you have to stop stop using it
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
at the at the source and as I've already
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
shown you the remediation cost the cost
 
03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
for drinking water and wastewater
 
03:51:26.189 --> 03:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
facilities and the cost frankly for
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
landfills to be processing these out is
 
03:51:32.590 --> 03:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
astronomical and the way this bill is
 
03:51:36.149 --> 03:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
written you know there's really no
 
03:51:39.189 --> 03:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
particular the the the people who have
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to this are
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it's not like retailers
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
and people like that in the um in the
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
state you really and in the meantime I
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
just want to say that if you don't ban
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
the p in these
 
03:51:59.469 --> 03:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
products people are consuming them the
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
packaging is also getting thrown away
 
03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
the carpets is are getting thrown away
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
and then it goes to the wastewater
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
treatment plant so that's where you I
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean we have I have two people here from
 
03:52:12.309 --> 03:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
miramac that can speak to this far
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
better than I can but they've spent
 
03:52:17.229 --> 03:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
unbelievable amounts of money there and
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
and from a health standpoint their
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
people have been very severely impacted
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I appreciate that but I don't
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
think they've been impacted by products
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
right they were impacted by some
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of something or rather
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
right you I I think that the larger
 
03:52:37.149 --> 03:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
impact on miramac is certainly St Bo
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
gobain but you can't um that's the big
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
impact but you can't um SE separate out
 
03:52:48.910 --> 03:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
what we're all consuming um through the
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
products that we're exposed to and I
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them but I don't
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
think they want their people exposed to
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
any more P whether it's from St gobain
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
or from the products they use and I'm
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
not sure that their taxpayers want to
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
spend a lot more money on processing out
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
the P that they didn't ask for because
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
they're the the the drinking water in
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
marac is coming from the marac river
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
isn't it largely and ground and and so
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're having to process it out to the
 
03:53:24.149 --> 03:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
trillions uh that's what the testing
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirement is and you have a letter
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
from the person who's the head of the
 
03:53:30.910 --> 03:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
marac village
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
District in
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
support all right let's go ahead all
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
right so let somebody else
 
03:53:36.520 --> 03:53:37.550 align:start position:0%
right so let somebody else
representative

03:53:37.550 --> 03:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
gry I'm I'm trying to understand this
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
because and based on some of the
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked here and and
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
you made a comment earlier that
 
03:53:45.870 --> 03:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
biosolids were the problem but biosolids
 
03:53:49.229 --> 03:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
are the problem because it's leate from
 
03:53:52.030 --> 03:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
or basically it's the bi it's the it's
 
03:53:53.309 --> 03:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
the waste that comes out of the water
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
treatment plants that is the sludge that
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
is treated and when it's treated most of
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
the time it's treated for biologics it's
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
not treated for past so that it's and
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's considered safe to apply
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
to to land and that's what happened in
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
Maine was that they applied these what
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
we considered to be safe biosolids but
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
they were contaminated with PE fast that
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
comes from household waste that comes
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
from what goes down your sink um you
 
03:54:21.790 --> 03:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
know and and that's part of the problem
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I'm correct and correct me if
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong here and then the other part
 
03:54:28.030 --> 03:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
of the problem is products that are dis
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
that are disposed of through your
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
garbage um sofas coting and stuff like
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that goes to Wastewater that goes
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
to landfills is subjected to the
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
environment it's then the you know water
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
gets there the leech the P leeches out
 
03:54:46.030 --> 03:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
of that it goes into their leech eight
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
much of that ends up going over to a
 
03:54:50.110 --> 03:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
water treatment plant as well but uh
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
some of it also May in some instances
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
get into groundwater uh but the thing is
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
is that wastewater treatment plants um
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
are not able to really to take care of
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff if and if what we need
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
to do is we need you're saying we need
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
to stop it at a source so that it
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't get into the landfill and it
 
03:55:10.149 --> 03:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't go down the drain of your sink
 
03:55:12.670 --> 03:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
and and that's how we stop the past and
 
03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know you're not going to stop it all
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
but what we're looking looking at is
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of pasas I mean
 
03:55:19.309 --> 03:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
there are other ways of pasas getting
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
into the environment such as who smoke
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
stacks that you folks have dealt with in
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
in marac um but the thing is is that
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's basically materials that we have
 
03:55:29.110 --> 03:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
every day in our kitchens and our living
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
rooms and our clothing uh that's getting
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
into the water into Wastewater and
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
getting into our garbage streams that
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
are creating this and by eliminating
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
that that's going to help reduce our
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
problem I mean that's that is definitely
 
03:55:46.149 --> 03:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
the the idea I mean we can talk about
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
the biosolid but there's a lot of uh
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about sludge versus
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
biosolid biosolid is processed sludge
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
and biosolids in New Hampshire is now
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
being tested for p certain pasas um but
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
I mean you you're absolutely right what
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
is going into the landfills at this
 
03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
point is either refu from consumer
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
products um or sludge that's going back
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
in it into it I mean hundreds of
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
millions of gallons of landfill leech a
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
is being processed through these
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants and it's
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
coming from us and the products that we
 
03:56:30.070 --> 03:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
use and we can't stop any of this if we
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't stop um using products with P
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
added I also I have one more point we
 
03:56:39.790 --> 03:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
just need to understand this bill
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
applies to intentionally added past not
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
PS it happens to be there through
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
process it it it's intentionally
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
added further question representative
 
03:56:55.399 --> 03:56:58.590 align:start position:0%
added further question representative
gry

03:56:58.590 --> 03:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
have so I I understand there's a new
 
03:57:01.239 --> 03:57:02.269 align:start position:0%
have so I I understand there's a new
fiscal

03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
note is that correct no we haven't I
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
think no it's wrong so that's why the
 
03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
director really but these other PE I
 
03:57:11.790 --> 03:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
should get out of here and let these
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
other people
 
03:57:13.159 --> 03:57:15.429 align:start position:0%
other people
talk

03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
talk
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
to me well there's um it says at least
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
on the original fiscal note that the
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:57:27.550 --> 03:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
states it is unable to accur accurately
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
calculate the complete Financial impact
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
of this bill so the new fiscal note will
 
03:57:35.830 --> 03:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
completely and accurately show the
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill are there any before we have you
 
03:57:44.590 --> 03:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
Mike are there any more questions for
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative eel or I mean these guys
 
03:57:48.550 --> 03:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
should be oh I'm sorry representative
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
for for interesting the bill I'm just
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
curious the enforcement mechanism
 
03:57:55.630 --> 03:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
because it seems like we're investing in
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
this Clearing House to prevent it from
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
coming in in the first place but if
 
03:58:02.429 --> 03:58:02.439 align:start position:0%
somebody has been found to intentionally
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
add PAs to their product what is the
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
fine that we should be Ling I'm I'm
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to let the director speak more to
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
this but the process is that the uh the
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
department can request a certificate of
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
compliance and then there's a series of
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms already in our
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
statutes that they can follow to um to
 
03:58:31.870 --> 03:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
enforce the uh to enforce the Bill thank
 
03:58:33.870 --> 03:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
you kind of a follow-up to
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney what is a
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
substitute for pasas it appears that
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's using it from whether it's
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
utensils to rugs to whatever what's the
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
substitute I mean I think they're
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're figuring it out and I think I
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because that's
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
an important Point there's this concept
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
floating around out there about um about
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if pasas is essential in some way um
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to say again that the
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
products that are selected in here
 
03:59:05.199 --> 03:59:06.349 align:start position:0%
products that are selected in here
there's

03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
no essential need for pasas in them it's
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
not like it's a heart V
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
replacement or something like that I
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
mean if I don't happen to wear a
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
foundation but if I did and it ran in
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
care thank you for that
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
example um Mike
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
whimet oh I'm
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry we could go in that
 
03:59:41.309 --> 03:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
order if you like no go ahead Mor okay I
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to briefly Mooney sure thank
 
03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and colleagues on the
 
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee so for the record I'm
 
03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative Moren money I represent
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
the town of marac Hillsboro County
 
03:59:55.229 --> 03:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
District 12 I support House Bill 1649
 
03:59:57.870 --> 03:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor to House Bill
 
04:00:00.750 --> 04:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
1649 now I fully understand that some
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsors will have to be told no by
 
04:00:08.030 --> 04:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
house finance outside of a budget year
 
04:00:10.110 --> 04:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
if not then collectively the bills
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
referred to us would amount to about 2
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
billion above
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget however this bill is in a must
 
04:00:23.429 --> 04:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
pass category as a representative of a
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
community directly affected by what is
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
now the biggest most dramatic
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
environmental disaster in the state's
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
history this bill is a necessity to
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
starting stopping
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
P I've been involved like my colleague
 
04:00:45.269 --> 04:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
also from miramac in now what is
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
accumulated to hours hours of
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
discussions and meetings on the subject
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
of P both its environmental effects and
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
health effects
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
repeatedly repeatedly the only way to
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
stop it is to prohibit or ban it that's
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding that's it and this bill
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
is the vehicle having received the
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
latest Sur plus just yesterday this bill
 
04:01:18.510 --> 04:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
is Affordable necessary and good for New
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the matter of health
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
effects I would just remind the
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee that in our budget passed
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
unanimously last year we asked for the
 
04:01:34.269 --> 04:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
phase three feasibility health study in
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
miramac only twice in 10 years has a
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
phase three of a health study been
 
04:01:44.189 --> 04:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
requested because of the severity of the
 
04:01:46.590 --> 04:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
health effects on the community so with
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
that I would ask that you vote a to pass
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1649 thank you
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
all thank you would you accept any
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any certainly
 
04:01:57.600 --> 04:01:59.790 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any certainly
representative

04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:02.110 --> 04:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you for taking my thank
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:02:04.239 --> 04:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
my

04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
question um what is the process uh where
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
does that study stand at this point do
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
we have any conclusions yet uh dhh a
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS is here and we're fortunate enough
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
to have the prime sponsor of the uh
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
study here as well with regards to
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're probably the best to describe it
 
04:02:27.630 --> 04:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
but it's moving based on the um pasas
 
04:02:30.030 --> 04:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
commission I serve on and representative
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.910 --> 04:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you um Nancy Murphy town of
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
March um I know DHHS is here um but that
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
um approval for that funding was signed
 
04:02:48.269 --> 04:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
by uh governor and Council and the
 
04:02:50.349 --> 04:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
project is just in its very ear early
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
stages of Dartmouth College is working
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
with DHHS um Dr Megan Romano is leading
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
that study and um right now I know
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of putting
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
together Community um groups for for
 
04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
communication between um uh Dartmouth
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
and DHHS and the March community so
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me we're at the very at the very
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
beginning but I I I think maybe DHHS can
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
also clarify there's a limited time I
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
think it's two years maybe that two
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
years yes that they have to complete so
 
04:03:23.469 --> 04:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to do in a in a short
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
amount of time and I think they're just
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
figuring out um exactly how that how the
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
stud is going to work but finally the
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
funding was the was the big piece and um
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
once that was received the contract was
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
able to be signed and it is now in
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
process further questions for
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
president uh is there an end date where
 
04:03:48.189 --> 04:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
HHS good afternoon members of the
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michelle robers um
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau chief for public health
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
protection within the division of Public
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
Health Services with the Department of
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um to answer
 
04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
your question relative to the contract
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes the contract is in place for two
 
04:04:17.309 --> 04:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
years and it it uh goes through June
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
30th I believe of 2025 and that is the
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
expectation is to have the feasibility
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
period any further questions for
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative I yes representative wer
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
as far as we know is this the H first
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
human study all the other studies of
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
past effects have been
 
04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
past effects have been
animals

04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah no I I I I really can't speak to
 
04:04:51.309 --> 04:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
the breath of the studies but certainly
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire this is the first
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
feasibility study um that we're looking
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
at with respect to that I haven't seen
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
anything in literature that refers to
 
04:04:59.080 --> 04:05:00.910 align:start position:0%
anything in literature that refers to
human

04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
human
 
04:05:04.149 --> 04:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
studies I would say that this um PS have
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
been well studied pooa in particular
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
pfoa um and that's the um uh the prime
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
um chemical uh that we're we're dealing
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
with in March although there are many
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of of pasas chemicals
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are impacting March there are over
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
10,000 I think probably 15,000 P
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
identified but in order um for um these
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
these chemicals to um receive um the
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
determinations to be made around um
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant levels what what is
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
safe for human exposure um in a great
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
amount of research and data has to be
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
collected and that um we've often heard
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
people say well you know you have no
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
proof that it causes whatever um you
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
know a community may be raising as a
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
health issue and um fairly recently uh
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
PFA has been determined to cause cancer
 
04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
So based on Research we do have the data
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's backing up the concerns that that
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
community members are voicing in
 
04:06:07.630 --> 04:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
environmentally impacted areas this was
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
human studies yes I believe yes thank
 
04:06:10.239 --> 04:06:12.110 align:start position:0%
human studies yes I believe yes thank
you

04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions for
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney or Murphy or the
 
04:06:18.750 --> 04:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
kind lady from the Department of Health
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
Services seeing none
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
thanks representative money you have
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
something else to
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
add thank you Mr chair and I appreciate
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
it I know representative Murphy has a
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
statement to read I think it's important
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
the division hear
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
it oh absolutely thank you again good
 
04:06:41.550 --> 04:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair and honorable members
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I'm Nancy Murphy
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
representing the town of marac which is
 
04:06:48.670 --> 04:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 today I'm here in support
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
of HB uh 1649 as a co-sponsor and a
 
04:06:54.269 --> 04:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
representative for the town of marac
 
04:06:56.149 --> 04:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
which is the site of the largest
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
environmental industrial disaster in New
 
04:07:00.429 --> 04:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's history um 10 years ago New
 
04:07:02.710 --> 04:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taken no action to address the
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
use of pest in our state the Live Free
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
or Die state had few environmental
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
regulations that would have protected
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
our citizens which made it appealing
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
easy and very profitable for pollas to
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
take up residents here and so they did
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
they pretended to be corporate good
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
corporate neighbors while filling our
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
air water and soil and us with toxic
 
04:07:23.149 --> 04:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
chemicals we weren't and still are not
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
adequately protected some of us will be
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
paying the consequences of this
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
contamination for the rest of our lives
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
those citizens don't have the power to
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
stop our exposure the New Hampshire
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
general court has the ability in the
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
past but not the will thankfully some of
 
04:07:40.269 --> 04:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
that's changed the vast majority of New
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens had never heard of
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
pasas man-made toxic chemic that have
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
such concerning bioaccumulation and
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
biodegradation properties it wasn't
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
until 2016 with the discovery of the
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
past contamination of maramax and
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
surrounding uh communities in Southern
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're drinking water
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
that um a small group of informed
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
citizens recognized the enormity of the
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
mess that we were in and publicly
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
sounded the alarm since that time we're
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're in a very different place and many
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
more people are educated and informed
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
about about um why we need to be so
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about these these um these
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
harmful chemicals um March and
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities found themselves
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a public health and
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
environmental crisis um that citizens
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
neither created nor were able to end on
 
04:08:29.149 --> 04:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
our own doing nothing was not a solution
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
and so after election to the the house
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
citizen Advocates turned legislators
 
04:08:35.070 --> 04:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
began beating the drum about the
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
necessity for these public health and
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protections from pest
 
04:08:42.750 --> 04:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's what hb1 1649 is um that effort
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
you can see uh continues today since
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that time uh and through a variety of
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
efforts thankfully New Hampshire has
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
become far more informed about Pest and
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
the harms
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
Associated however that knowledge has no
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
value unless we use it for good citizens
 
04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
are paying for remediation of public and
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
private Wells the cost of inhome
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
filtration to ensure that our families
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
have safe drinking water and the cost of
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care to address negative Health

04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
causal connection was recently
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
scientifically proven and confirms one
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
of our greatest fears pest causes cancer
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%

contract with Dartmouth and is U uh
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
being used to investigate this finding
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
if we care about the health and that of
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
our families and our neighbors we must
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
stop our exposure HB 1649 is all about
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
stopping our exposure ongoing exposure
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
is particularly concerning and
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
detrimental to those of us living in
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
pfast contaminated communities like
 
04:10:03.229 --> 04:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
those in Southern New Hampshire and on
 
04:10:05.710 --> 04:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast one of the uh questions I
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
think raised earlier was um well yes our
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
exposure in March has been primarily
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
through drinking water but given the
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
exposure we've already had we don't need
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
any additional exposure and it's not
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
just our town it's it's it's as
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative eel said anywhere in New
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most people we're just aware
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
of of it and many people um with with
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
high exposure are
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
not um Beyond uh the dangers of pest the
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
most important thing we've learned is
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
that the only way to truly Pro protect
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
Public Health in the environment from
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
pest harms is to stop the source and
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm here to testify today
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
hb1 1649 is the next step New Hampshire
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
needs to take the bill aims to stop the
 
04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
source of PS contamination in Goods that
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the environment and
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
public health and burden all of us due
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the cost to manage them in the waste
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
management area remediation and impacts
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
to Public Health the number one solution
 
04:11:05.109 --> 04:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
to the pest mess we're in is to stop the
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
source HB 1649 will go a long way in
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
addressing that without Source reduction
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
this nightmare will never end um I ask
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
that you please support this important
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you can we have a copy
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
of your testimony oh I can send it this
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
one you don't want all right sure send
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
it to me I will sure thank you are there
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
Mone or
 
04:11:32.670 --> 04:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy seeing none thank you very much
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we could get Mike whimet from
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:11:40.239 --> 04:11:42.229 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
up

04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:11:42.239 --> 04:11:44.750 align:start position:0%
up
here

04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
and again just a reminder Mike if we
 
04:11:49.149 --> 04:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
could focus on the fiscal impact
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely since the house has made it
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
pretty clear of their support sure uh so
 
04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
um first of all for the record my name
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
is Mike wisat I serve as director of the
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
Services and I I do I I want to do a Mia
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
Culp here we did receive a request from
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant to do a
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal impact worksheet for this
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
bill and we we we we muffed it we didn't
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
do it quite right we we looked at it and
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
and and really kind of didn't add any
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
changes the reality is is that with the
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
Amendments that have been made to the
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
bill particularly with respect to
 
04:12:25.630 --> 04:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
removing the uh notification
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
requirements in the bill and the
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements um that does have
 
04:12:32.830 --> 04:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
a substantial fiscal impact on the on or
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
changes substantially the fiscal impact
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill when we first looked at this
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill with a notification requirements we
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
anticipated that in order to effectively
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
Implement those we would need to join um
 
04:12:46.030 --> 04:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
a a national Clearing House probably
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
through the international chemicals
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
Clearing House um and and actually pay
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
to have uh the programming done to
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
develop a New Hampshire specific module
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
to that to that Clearing House database
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that was probably going to be on the
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
order of a couple hundred thousand
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
dollar or perhaps more and it wasn't
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
really clear how much it would be
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
because there isn't a lot of it's hard
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
you if you've ever tried to get quotes
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
for for programming they always seem to
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
end up higher than where youed to start
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
so we that's one of the reasons we said
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
that it was really difficult for us to
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
develop um an actual cost of this now
 
04:13:21.790 --> 04:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
that this bill has been amended to
 
04:13:23.550 --> 04:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
remove the notification labeling
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
requirements uh we believe it's it's
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
substantially easier to to to
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
essentially estimate what it would be
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
what it would mean for the agency to
 
04:13:34.109 --> 04:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
implement the bill so as as it's been
 
04:13:36.109 --> 04:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
amended we believe that we would still
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
need a position to to work that up to
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
develop a program and be able to
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
administer it uh we don't we we probably
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
would join the clearing house but we
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
understand that's less than $10,000 a
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
year for dues um we don't believe we
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
would need to um have a module a state
 
04:13:54.030 --> 04:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
specific module programmed for the
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
agency and as a result uh we think that
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know probably that would put us in a
 
04:14:00.990 --> 04:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
position to administer the bill through
 
04:14:03.389 --> 04:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
that position um which of course makes
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
it much easier for us to estimate what
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
it might cost on an annual basis I'm
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
any do you believe you'll have that
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
information over to uh Mr Hoffman
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
so we can get it to we will absolutely
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
do that and again I apologize to the
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee we we we messed this one up
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we we should have had this right
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
before today's
 
04:14:24.309 --> 04:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
hearing representative Maguire followed
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
by representative eel uh thank you Mr
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um so we have something here
 
04:14:32.510 --> 04:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
that says that dust has half a million
 
04:14:34.510 --> 04:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion of
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
P um if we were to spend this money and
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
the bill were to become law what
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
fraction of the pasas were exposed to
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
would decline you know are we cutting
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
out half of it sure a percent of it well
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really hard for me to
 
04:14:53.550 --> 04:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
quantify that but I can talk about it um
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
in in in a qualified manner um we've
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
been working in Earnest on this ever
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
since we discovered the problem in
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire in
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
2016 and by 2017 if you go back to the
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
Department's testimony and a number of
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
bills that have come before this body
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
since then I believe we said and I I
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
personally testified before number of
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
committees that we weren't going to
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
solve this P problem unless we
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
substantially remove P from from from
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
General Commerce and the reason for that
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that what we learned you know we were
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
on a steep learning curve when we when
 
04:15:28.349 --> 04:15:28.359 align:start position:0%
we first had discovered this but what we
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
learned is that and I guess maybe the
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
best example that goes to your question
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that um just a few years ago a 16
 
04:15:38.189 --> 04:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
ounce bottle of resolved carpet cleaner
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
was essentially 100% pfoa And if you're
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
at all good at math and you know that we
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
regulate pfoa at 12 parts per ton in
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater you can imagine what one
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
bottle of that that ends up in the wrong
 
04:15:52.109 --> 04:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
place can do in practice what happens is
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
that you know carpets are already
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
treated with past compounds when they're
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured we know that that's what
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
dupon stain master and and those other
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
stain resistant treatments are and then
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
when you clean your carpet you use
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
Resolve Carpet Cleaner or a spot remover
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
um and that ends up the exposure from
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
that is substantial you got babies
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
crawling on carpets you've got dust
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's created as you asked about um
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
from a carpet it gets Airborne you know
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
when you vacuum you know it just gets
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
unless you have a hepac it gets blown
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
out one end of the vacuum cleaner and
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
everyone in your house is breathing it
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
it gets on your food and you ingest it
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
um hamburger wrappers are another common
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
place that these are used um and so all
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
that taken together results in
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
substantial exposures directly to humans
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
but also ends up as it's been discussed
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
going into our Wastewater and and and
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
and particles that go to our landfill
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then the the sort of past Circle
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
happens with lee8 then going to the
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant and the past
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
essentially not really treated but being
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
partitioned between the sludge and the
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
discharge to the which in most cases is
 
04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
to one of our New Hampshire Rivers so um
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
when we developed uh when our
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
toxicologist worked on developing a
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard for pasas um
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand what went
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
into that calculation there was an
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
estimate that if you look at the total
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
burden of fast on the average human
 
04:17:17.309 --> 04:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
person um only about 20% of it would
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
come from drinking water so they use
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
that to calculate the standard but what
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
that means is 80% comes from other
 
04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
sources and those other sources are
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
things like dust and hamburger wrappers
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
and popcorn bags and all the you know
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
the list goes on and on and and so again
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
we we determined and and it became very
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
clear to us that while we're working in
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
Earnest you know our our main mission is
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
we try to make sure people have clean
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
Safe Drinking Water if if you just tried
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
to distill de's purpose to one thing and
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the only thing but drinking
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
water is a huge part of what we do
 
04:17:53.469 --> 04:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
that's what we've really been focused on
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
but as we learn more and more about
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
these compounds we realize that the
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
exposure is much much broader than that
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what I think this bill is is
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
trying to address did I hear you say
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
that this this carpet cleaner is no
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
longer sold uh I I believe it's still
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
sold I I I I am hopeful that it has been
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
reformulated I will I will tell you that
 
04:18:13.950 --> 04:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
there are still these compounds on the
 
04:18:17.469 --> 04:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
on the market I I learned much my to my
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
chagrin I have h a particular kind of
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
tile in my kitchen that is you can buy a
 
04:18:25.469 --> 04:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
a very broadly uh widely available
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
finish for that tile at Home Depot and
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
my wife was using it just a couple years
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
ago and I looked at the bottle and lo
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
and behold I realized it it it contains
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
substantial amounts of pasas so it's
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
still out there it's still being
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
marketed man so just go make sure no one
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
else has a question anyone else have a
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
grassie has has anyone taken it and to
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
do an analysis I know we're looking at
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of what what this is going to
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
cost us to enact this bill do anyone
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
take into account the cost if we don't
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
do this bill upon wastewater treatment
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
plans local communities health care cost
 
04:19:06.590 --> 04:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh cost at the state for cleanups and
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
and and impacts on on businesses as well
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
that are going to be held responsible
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
has anybody looked at what I mean
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of Millions to billions I would
 
04:19:16.349 --> 04:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
think it's certainly it's a huge complex
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
calculation I will tell you just to put
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
in Easy
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
terms EPA has got proposed drinking
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
water standards for past including pooa
 
04:19:27.070 --> 04:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
that are even lower than the ones that
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
we currently enforce and um we commented
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
on that because we were mainly concerned
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
that their estimate of the economic
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
impact of that was vastly understated
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
because at the time that they first
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
proposed it they suggested that it would
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
cost about $700 million nationally to
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
implement and I'm sorry to say that when
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
we looked at what we knew about our
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Systems what it cost to
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
treat them to meet that standard and how
 
04:19:54.109 --> 04:19:54.119 align:start position:0%
many of them would need to do that we
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
came up with almost $700 million in New
 
04:19:56.319 --> 04:19:58.630 align:start position:0%
came up with almost $700 million in New
Hampshire

04:19:58.630 --> 04:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
so representative evil um hi uh just a
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
couple of questions just following up on
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
what representative grassy said isn't
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
there discussion also at the EPA um on
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
having testing standards for past for
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
surface water release from wastewater
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
treatment plants yes that's that's being
 
04:20:20.429 --> 04:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
looked at by the agency and and that um
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
is likely to have a substantial impact
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at you know most of the
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
major towns and cities in New Hampshire
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
have a Wastewater Plant and almost all
 
04:20:30.030 --> 04:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
of them discharg directly to they're
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
they're treated effent discharges
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
directly to one of our New Hampshire
 
04:20:35.790 --> 04:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
rivers and uh to the extent that
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
depending on where those standards land
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
and particularly for those facilities
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are located within 20 mi uh
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
Upstream of an intake for drinking water
 
04:20:45.309 --> 04:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
system and there are many because we do
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
have intakes along the marac river in
 
04:20:49.630 --> 04:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
particular um they would very likely
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
need to treat their effluent to meet
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
that standard in order to be in
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and that will be very
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
substantial in terms of cost do you
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
think it's at least 700
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
million uh did you say million or
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
billion yeah million it's well right I I
 
04:21:06.309 --> 04:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
me I think that if you start to do the
 
04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
math on this depending where this lands
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to represent a very
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
substantial substantial cost I just have
 
04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
one more on the fiscal note um I have
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
the the in the amount in the bill for
 
04:21:21.550 --> 04:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
the employee which again is capped at
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
five years there's also
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 that um amount you had
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
previously estimated would be used
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
entirely for the clearing house and now
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
the clearing and and it and it didn't
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
leave any additional money for just
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so um
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
I assume that you still will have
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
administrative costs associated with
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
this program that would be on on going
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
as you develop it um and I assume that
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
money could still be used by the
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
department that that would be our hope
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
and our understanding yes okay thank you
 
04:22:04.590 --> 04:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative Wier thank you Mr
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr whet is a lot of this stuff
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
used in the dry cleaning business they
 
04:22:13.710 --> 04:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
do they have any pfas uh yeah it's our
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that um not so much you
 
04:22:17.070 --> 04:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
know typical the typical dry cleaning
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
fluid is per chloroethylene which which
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily contain past but um
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you might have a spot
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
treated or you might have your you might
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
have your article of clothing cleaned
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
and then you might ask them to put a
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
stain resistant you know material on it
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
compound question please I just sure I I
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
do have a quick question m so the origin
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
of pasas is this a petroleum based or
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
where does it come from so pasas were
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually they're man-made compounds they
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't occur in nature they're synthetic
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
compounds that were developed in the
 
04:22:54.960 --> 04:22:56.109 align:start position:0%
compounds that were developed in the
late

04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
late
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
1940s um and they um I mean almost
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
everything that I mean they're organic
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
compounds so I wouldn't be surprised if
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
petroleum products are used in their
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but they're not by their
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
nature petroleum they don't they're not
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
contained in crude oil that you take out
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
of the ground they are actually
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
synthesized and manufactured at a
 
04:23:14.040 --> 04:23:15.550 align:start position:0%
synthesized and manufactured at a
chemical

04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
plant representative eil Follow by
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire Can you estimate
 
04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
roughly what the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
has already um expended uh for p
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
remediation and do you have any idea
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
even going ahead what you would estimate
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess if to frame the question
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
when you say the state of Hampshire you
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
mean the state government or yeah so
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
certainly I I think you mentioned
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony representable
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
over $100 million and that's certainly
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
true if you look at the money that's
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
been appropriated by this body and the
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
and the uh monies that we've used uh
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
from other sources to address this we're
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
definitely in excess of 100 million no
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
question about it I think moving forward
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
um we will indeed you know continue to
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
incur cost we we still spent a
 
04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of man hours on this
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
on this compound on these contaminants
 
04:24:09.630 --> 04:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
um but I think that almost is not the
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
story the real story is what our local
 
04:24:13.229 --> 04:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
communities is are going to be spending
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
in our in our individ in in the public
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
and private sector on a smaller scale
 
04:24:21.070 --> 04:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
because of the need to treat so many
 
04:24:23.309 --> 04:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
community and public water systems and
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
then potentially moving forward um our
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
Wastewater systems that's where the real
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
big dollars are going to start to add up
 
04:24:29.840 --> 04:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
big dollars are going to start to add up
very

04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
quickly represent McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
chairman how many products are regulated
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
by this
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
bill I I don't know the answer to that
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Su I suspect it's a substantial number
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
of products I mean if you look at um you
 
04:24:49.469 --> 04:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
know the categories there there are I'm
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
sure thousands of products that would be
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
would be banned from having P added to
 
04:24:59.109 --> 04:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
them and how would you proceed I mean do
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
you test these products are are you
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
going to start massive testing and find
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
out this one has past and therefore it's
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's gone or what so I think uh that's a
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
great question so obviously this is this
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
whole movement towards B in past and
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
products is happening both regionally
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
and nationally so I think that you know
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
large manufacturers that are marketing
 
04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
their products across the country or
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
across the region are going to be
 
04:25:25.229 --> 04:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
looking to to solve this and I think
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
what I would Envision one of the
 
04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
concerns we had frankly was when the
 
04:25:31.469 --> 04:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
notification requirements were in
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
there we didn't know how we were going
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
to process all those notifications
 
04:25:36.189 --> 04:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
because there are so many products and
 
04:25:37.710 --> 04:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
we weren't really convinced that that
 
04:25:39.109 --> 04:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
was going to be all that valuable in
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
terms of um you know the for the time
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we would spend and the money we
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
would spend to collect that information
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't convinced it was really going
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
to help very much so what we would much
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
rather do is um you know working with
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why I said we were very
 
04:25:54.510 --> 04:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
likely join the clearing house so that
 
04:25:56.429 --> 04:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
we would be getting access to
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
information that's being provided across
 
04:26:00.790 --> 04:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
different states and across the country
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
and then use that information to
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
identify where we need to focus uh
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring efforts to make
 
04:26:09.149 --> 04:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
sure you know so if we learn that what's
 
04:26:10.830 --> 04:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
being experienced in various states that
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
are implementing these laws is that a
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
particular product line is a violator
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
then we could go to that and say okay
 
04:26:19.109 --> 04:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
can you give us a a certification and if
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
they certify to us and show us that
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're compliant that's the end of the
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
story if they're not able to do that we
 
04:26:26.189 --> 04:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
might well go out and Sample the product
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
test it and then take appropriate uh
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
compliance uh assurance and and
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions do you really think
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
this certification thing is necessary
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
because if I were somebody breaking the
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
law say in ch I'm in China or something
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I just send the letter and and
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
now you're off my back for another
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
couple years or well that would assume
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we always believe everything
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
everyone tells us and we never do so if
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
I if we got a certification but we still
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
had reason to believe that there was
 
04:26:59.950 --> 04:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
non- compliance then we'd still sample
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
and evaluate but in many cases you know
 
04:27:05.870 --> 04:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
um it's a matter of timing maybe
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
somebody isn't compliant but then they
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
fix their problem and they're able to
 
04:27:11.469 --> 04:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
show demonstrate real evidence that
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
they've they've gotten they managed to
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
get the pasas out of their product then
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need to waste anybody's time
 
04:27:19.109 --> 04:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
but to the extent we weren't confident
 
04:27:20.590 --> 04:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
about that that's where we would focus
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
our compliance monitoring
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
efforts so I brought a product here uh
 
04:27:31.389 --> 04:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
it's called thundershield silicon water
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
repellent um I don't it says no cfc's
 
04:27:37.630 --> 04:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say anything about no P
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
um how would you know looking at this I
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
mean I have no way of knowing is there
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
pass in here uh I I I I don't know for
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I would look at the
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
ingredients first I mean it's easy these
 
04:27:50.429 --> 04:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
kind of things don't have a list of
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
ingredients it's not food so sure no but
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're able we we often are able to
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
obtain um safety data sheets from these
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
compounds that you don't get one when
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
you buy it at the store but they exist
 
04:28:05.070 --> 04:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
when these chemical products all have to
 
04:28:06.870 --> 04:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a safety data sheet associated with
 
04:28:08.590 --> 04:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
them and we can go you can go to the
 
04:28:11.229 --> 04:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and get a copy of that and
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's not always
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
completely um informative but you know
 
04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of staff that have been
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
working for years regulating hazardous
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
waste and hazardous waste facilities so
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
we we have a lot of experience running
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
to ground what a comp what a particular
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
product might have and then when we're
 
04:28:27.720 --> 04:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
product might have and then when we're
not

04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
certain the best way is always to obtain
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
a sample and test it
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
yourself yeah I I'm just worried that
 
04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
the the amount of money here isn't
 
04:28:41.070 --> 04:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
anything like what would be necessary to
 
04:28:41.080 --> 04:28:42.630 align:start position:0%
anything like what would be necessary to
to

04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:45.109 --> 04:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
systematically make sure that all such
 
04:28:46.750 --> 04:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
product I mean there's there's there's
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of products on
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
this list in my opinion right so are you
 
04:28:54.030 --> 04:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
sure that this will do the job this
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of money here I'm not
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting let me add something okay we
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
have another bill today right which
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
proposes to regulate 15 stores that are
 
04:29:08.349 --> 04:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
selling one product made by six
 
04:29:10.830 --> 04:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers or something like that
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
right and and the agent asks us for $8
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
million a year right okay you're asking
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
us for a quarter of a million dollars a
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
year for hundreds of thousands of
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
products it seems to me right it doesn't
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't compute here well what I'm
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
not suggesting for a moment that we'll
 
04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
ever be able to say yeah all these
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
products are are are pfast free that's
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what we can ever say about a
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
a compliance monitoring program we have
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know on a much smaller scale we have
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
several thousand small quantity
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
generators of hazardous waste we visit a
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
very small number of those every year
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
but what we do is we we we do Outreach
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
and education we do training and then we
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
through that compliance monitoring when
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
we find a problem we take appropriate
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement and we basically make an
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
example and that's one of the ways you
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
you kind of look bigger than you really
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
are by targeting the work you know
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
sharing information with our neighboring
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
states we're going to and States across
 
04:30:11.229 --> 04:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
the country that are going to have a lot
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
of information
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
and then you really targeting our
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
efforts so it's it's a drop in the
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
bucket compared to the total Universe of
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
of products no question but that's
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know nobody I would never
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
want to come to this body and ask you
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money it would take to
 
04:30:29.309 --> 04:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
sample and monitor every product that
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
would be absurd and it wouldn't be a
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
good use of anybody's money um so I
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that what we do whenever you know
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
setting this bill aside whenever we come
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
when we're asked to do something and
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
evaluate a particular sector of our
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
Commerce and and evaluate its compliance
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
with an environmental requirement we're
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
always trying to devise a coste
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
effective way to monitor it and get an
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
understanding what's happening and then
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
learn to focus in kind of like a laser
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
on the areas where there's likely to be
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and that's the way we
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
would address this and I don't suggest
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a moment that it'll be 100%
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
compliance but it it'll be good it it'll
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
effective so representative Maguire
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
raises an interest interesting point I
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned earlier you're going
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
to see a reduction in the fiscal note
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
because you're taking some things back
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
right so you're taking things back that
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
may make this a better Bill if they were
 
04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
on the bill and would require the
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
initial funding that you requested or no
 
04:31:32.910 --> 04:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
I think all I'm suggesting is that we
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know you had asked earlier I believe
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman about our statement that it
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
was very difficult to to estimate the
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
actual fiscal impact and what I'm
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
suggesting is the way the bill has been
 
04:31:46.269 --> 04:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
amended it's easier to do that now
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
because primarily the notification
 
04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
requirement being removed we no longer
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
need to administer that and that was
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a substantial cost to
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
administer and we didn't think it was
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
that helpful because number one it only
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
applied for two years it was it was it
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was originally
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
structured the notifications were
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
required for companies to notify that
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
they were monit that they were marketing
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
a product in in New Hampshire
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was going to be subject to the ban
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
in a subsequent year and so we were
 
04:32:17.790 --> 04:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
going to invest a whole lot of energy
 
04:32:20.349 --> 04:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
and money into a module with a Clearing
 
04:32:22.750 --> 04:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
House try to collect that information
 
04:32:24.030 --> 04:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
and then two years later those
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
notifications would stop coming in and
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
we just didn't see first of all it was
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
really hard for us to estimate what it
 
04:32:31.630 --> 04:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
would cost to administer that and we
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
didn't really see that it was going
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
to add that much value representative EV
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you I mean this
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
being a work session I hope it's all
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
right if I make a comment there's two
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
things and Mr uh whims can confirm this
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
the EPA in uh May of 2025 has put into
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
place a reporting requirement correct
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
for all products that are being sold
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
with pasas so that um reporting database
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
will already be available to the state
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
if they want to check anything the other
 
04:33:08.029 --> 04:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
thing that we're missing here in this
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and I just want to remind
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
everyone we are not first in in time on
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
any of these products all these products
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
are already being banned by upwards of
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
or most of them are being banned for up
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
by upwards of 14 states that are all and
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
so manufacturers are already complying
 
04:33:29.949 --> 04:33:29.959 align:start position:0%
or starting to comply with the banss
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
that have been put in place by these
 
04:33:35.189 --> 04:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
other states we're just taking a step
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
here on on and and I think if we don't
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
hear the I'm going to say this Cry of
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
the people to stop having pasas in our
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
products for two or
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
$300,000 to put this van into place I
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
think we're totally missing the boat and
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's not a question but I
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
just is it not correct that we are not
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
first in time and also we have done this
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
already with Mercury and toxics in
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
packaging yes on both counts that's
 
04:34:11.310 --> 04:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
correct are there any further questions
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
from Mr
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
webet seeing none thanks Michael thank
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
you chair do have a card Michael Strand
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
from Bedford representing the town of
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
Bedford think he's here but waste
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
management is here and they'd like to
 
04:34:30.150 --> 04:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
speak uh would you please come forward
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.709 --> 04:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you just very quickly I will
 
04:34:46.109 --> 04:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
summarize uh just a few points that I
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
had um as it was mentioned um my name is
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
Garrett treer director of public affairs
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
for Waste Management um we own and
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
operate the landfill in Rochester um uh
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
landfills as has been noted are passive
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
receivers of posos um we don't produce
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
we don't generate we don't utilize it in
 
04:35:06.510 --> 04:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
our operations but we to manage it
 
04:35:08.429 --> 04:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
through the course of um running our
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
landfill um I'll just go right to the I
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
was mentioned FIS impacts um TurnKey
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
facility does have a water leate
 
04:35:19.949 --> 04:35:19.959 align:start position:0%
treatment plant um recently invested $
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
three and A5 million do in that in that
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
process um to maintain that every month
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
is another $50,000 uh chart cost to the
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
facility which is born by the businesses
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
and residents who utilize a facility so
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh managing these materials is extremely
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
expensive um and without uh beginning
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
the process of starting to remove them
 
04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
from the environment um those costs will
 
04:35:45.070 --> 04:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
probably only increase as time goes by
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
that does not include you know facility
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance and and uh future um
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
expansions and whatnot so again I just
 
04:35:52.830 --> 04:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to be really quick as also was
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned other states are are dealing
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
with this we are supporting other states
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
to do that and as more do that I think
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers will start to um
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
change the way they uh make their
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
products so happy to answer any
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
questions and again thank you for
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
allowing me the time to to speak uh
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions I I
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
have one
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
um are you of course are you not a
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
member of the national waste and
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
recycling Association group and are
 
04:36:23.230 --> 04:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
there not uh members of that group from
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
around the state of New Hampshire that
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
that Association is speaking for that
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
also support this Bill yes the industry
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned did submit testimony uh
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the other Committee hearing and the
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
industry is uh supportive of these types
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
of bills not just here but throughout
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
the country absolutely yes and that
 
04:36:44.590 --> 04:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
would include cassella and wheel abider
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
and a variety of other companies that
 
04:36:49.869 --> 04:36:49.879 align:start position:0%
operate members of N correct thank you
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
of course seeing no further questions
 
04:36:52.480 --> 04:36:53.869 align:start position:0%
of course seeing no further questions
thank

04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
you um Michael Strand uh representing
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the town of
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford and it's asked for two minutes
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.709 --> 04:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
that we there we are I'll learn how to
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
use these someday um so my name is
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
Michael Strand I'm a a town counselor in
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
the town of Bedford um here to speak U
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
both on behalf of the interests of uh
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
the town and taxpayers but also have
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
some additional comments that are my own
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to clarify the difference
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
when we get there um most fundamentally
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill long-term will
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
protect municipalities from legal
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
liability and exposure um um we are in a
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
current environment no pun intended
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
where um when you know
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
long-term indirect exposure uh happens
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
towns are on the hook and often
 
04:37:58.349 --> 04:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
uninsured so we are facing uh a very
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous situation right now both
 
04:38:01.949 --> 04:38:01.959 align:start position:0%
short-term and long term and this is
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide many towns um
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
where you know if found uh you know
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
liable for past exposure that we either
 
04:38:14.910 --> 04:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know about or didn't cause um you
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
know you'd be in a situation where you
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
know local budgets can't handle that
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
type of cost you would directly impact
 
04:38:23.789 --> 04:38:23.799 align:start position:0%
you know property taxes um you know the
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
other part of it I think um you know is
 
04:38:29.310 --> 04:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
protecting the people in the towns and
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know I know that there's often uh
 
04:38:34.189 --> 04:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
you know a sentiment to you know protect
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire and that's not
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
a bad thing um but at what cost um so I
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
would offer that open question uh to the
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
committee um another issue that I have
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
having you spent the last two years on
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
the state P House Commission um is I
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
find it uh pretty unacceptable that the
 
04:38:57.629 --> 04:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
only way we can do remediation which you
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
know obviously water in this case um is
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
through state funded or federally funded
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
remediation mechanisms and so I would
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
remind the committee when we talk about
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
about cost that you know when we use
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars whether they're Federal
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars that we all pay or
 
04:39:22.590 --> 04:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
state you know taxpayer dollars you know
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
largely funded through property tax
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals Etc um you know we're
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
using taxpayer dollars to clean up
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination you know
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
this is tantamount to subsidizing our
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
own corporate chemical
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
polluters and there may not be an
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
immediate answer but this bill does
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
something to remove this substance from
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
the environment and that is noteworthy
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
and it is worthwhile and I would urge
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
you to pass it
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
um and I'll shift now you know some
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
couple quick personal opinions and get
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
out of your hair but um you know I would
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to consider long-term cost
 
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
versus short-term thinking um I have
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
noted on more than one occasion we
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
struggle with that in New Hampshire
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it doesn't make any sense
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
to leave our kids with the bill uh or
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
future tax payers with the bill because
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
we wanted to uh you know be friendly to
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
large companies whom often are shipping
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
their profits out of state sometimes out
 
04:40:20.718 --> 04:40:21.510 align:start position:0%
their profits out of state sometimes out
of

04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
country um so I would urge you to put
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
people in public health um in our local
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
towns over again often out ofate
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
National or multinational corporate
 
04:40:35.070 --> 04:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
profits um we have to remove this from
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
the environment every day that we stall
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
in doing so we'll continu the same
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
issues that we are paying for hand over
 
04:40:46.270 --> 04:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
fist and you know if you believe in free
 
04:40:48.750 --> 04:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
market capitalism which I most certainly
 
04:40:52.350 --> 04:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
do it's not the job of government to
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
protect big business it's just not let
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
the free market adjust we'll be
 
04:41:00.080 --> 04:41:02.470 align:start position:0%
the free market adjust we'll be
fine

04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you seeing no further
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions or anyone else like to speak
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
seeing n the pleasure of the division
 
04:41:14.830 --> 04:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
again a reminder we are waiting for new
 
04:41:14.840 --> 04:41:17.948 align:start position:0%
again a reminder we are waiting for new
fiscal

04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.958 --> 04:41:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
note

04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.948 --> 04:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
your'll do it representative Evel you
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
had a question um your no I mean if the
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
I obviously am very interested in
 
04:41:39.390 --> 04:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
getting but it would be
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
helpful if it would be help to the
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
committee in um thinking more favorably
 
04:41:47.310 --> 04:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
toward it I would certainly be willing
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
and happy to wait for the updated fiscal
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
note represent McGuire thank you um I
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
know that um representative Mooney will
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
not be in committee on the 19 so um
 
04:42:01.470 --> 04:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
there's no harm I I think she would like
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
to vote uh in favor of this bill and so
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
um therefore I don't think we should
 
04:42:09.628 --> 04:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
execute next week in the full committee
 
04:42:11.470 --> 04:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore we don't necessarily L
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
have to execute
 
04:42:17.470 --> 04:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
today um and I just in I'm sorry I was
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
just going to say In fairness to the
 
04:42:22.110 --> 04:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
committee I want you to also know that
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney me and
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman have an amendment
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we were going to bring to um move
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
up the effective date from July 1st 2028
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
to January 1st of
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
2027 and um Mr Hoffman can distribute
 
04:42:40.920 --> 04:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
2027 and um Mr Hoffman can distribute
that

04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say I I've done a lot
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
of work on this obviously if any of you
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
have any questions um I hope you will
 
04:42:53.830 --> 04:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
ask me um I think just from the people
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
that have been here today you see the
 
04:42:58.030 --> 04:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
strength of the feeling here and this is
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
about half of what uh we saw before the
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee which went through

February so it's just someone that would
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.030 --> 04:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none

Griffin I think correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman but uh didn't fiscal deal
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
with a bill from the federal government
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
uh a million and some dollars for for an
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
identical program no no we're talking
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
about 1666 oh I'm sorry yeah we're
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's the next one I'm I'm ahead of you
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're one no problem no problem
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman um uh let me ask um LBA I
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
believe that the house Amendment um
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
removed all the spending is that correct
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
um no there's actually a revised fiscal
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
note in front of you but I'm also or a
 
04:47:40.558 --> 04:47:41.350 align:start position:0%
note in front of you but I'm also or a
revised

04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
revised
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the amendment I'm also going to do
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
another one I just got some additional
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
information from secretary of state so
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
the new cost would be a one-time cost in
 
04:47:54.190 --> 04:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2026 for 50,000 to 150,000
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
costs that's a fiscal note that Aon
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
brought in there was a correction to it
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
she just sent me some additional
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
information so we need a new fiscal note
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
any other issues NOP that's
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
it does the division wish to wait to the
 
04:48:23.470 --> 04:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
now so we will wait for the revised
 
04:48:26.520 --> 04:48:29.868 align:start position:0%
now so we will wait for the revised
fiscal

04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
note um Melissa so we'll just let Janet
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
know this will be on for
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.718 --> 04:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
so next we have
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
1678 establishing a New Hampshire Farm
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%

years so good afternoon and this bill
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%

04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
and energy from stakeholders across the
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
state those in agriculture and the food
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
sectors those in school nutrition
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
programs and those community members who

are part of the social infrastructure
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
that helps local food the local food
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
economy thrive D last year we submitted
 
04:50:44.910 --> 04:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
a bill requesting State investment in a
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
farm to school program that school
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
districts across the state would be able
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
to access after feedback and
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department of
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture we have come back this year
 
04:50:56.590 --> 04:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
to ask first for the development of a
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
pilot program to help assess the
 
04:51:00.750 --> 04:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
feasibility of a local food incentive
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
program before attempting a program that
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
would allow access to all school
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
districts Statewide New Hampshire's Farm
 
04:51:09.230 --> 04:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
to school program operates in some
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
schools across the state where local
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
food nourishes children supports local
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
farmers and strengthens the resiliency
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
of our supply chain in some communities
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
however there are currently schools
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
across the state who would like to get
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the farm to school program
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
who need encouragement fiscally and
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
operationally the pilot program would
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
allow one school district in each of our
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
10 counties to
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
participate schools across the state can
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
apply to the Department of Agriculture
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
who will put together a committee and
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
criteria to choose schools to
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the pilot program and
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
then the department will also gather
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
data from the pilot program in order to
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
discern if and how best to go about a
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
farm to school incentive program that
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
would be accessible to all schools
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
across the
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
state um a couple of months ago the
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
United States Secretary of Agriculture
 
04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
Tom vilsack spoke here in New Hampshire
 
04:52:01.150 --> 04:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
and he described the many ways that we
 
04:52:02.670 --> 04:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
can support farming and Rural
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire one of the
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
ways we can do this is by investing in
 
04:52:09.910 --> 04:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
our local food systems investment in the
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
farm to school programs is an investment
 
04:52:14.190 --> 04:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
in our local economies investing in our
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
local food systems especially our rural
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
economies makes a big difference in the
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
economic viability of small and Medi
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
mediumsized Farms as
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
well this investment will support our
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
kids our schools and our
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
farmers and not only can we help our
 
04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
economy locally but we can also improve
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of our
 
04:52:35.070 --> 04:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
children and the resiliency at the local
 
04:52:35.080 --> 04:52:36.350 align:start position:0%
children and the resiliency at the local
food

04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
food
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
system so my hope is that we can start
 
04:52:40.628 --> 04:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
this pilot program and strengthen New
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's agricultural sector as well
 
04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
as our um food Security in New
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and again there are folks here
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
who'll be able to answer technical
 
04:52:54.270 --> 04:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions about the program um behind me
 
04:52:54.280 --> 04:52:57.390 align:start position:0%
questions about the program um behind me
as

04:52:57.390 --> 04:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
well well thank you would would you take
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
any questions um yes I will do my best
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman you said
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
that this will improve health school
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
children in in what
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
way sure so probably um Jean Pierce
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
who's behind me um a a food service um
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
Professional School nutrition
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
professional probably has a better
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
answer to that than I do but um food
 
04:53:29.788 --> 04:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
that does not have to travel as far does
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
not lose its nutrients as quickly so the
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
longer food is out of the ground or off
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
the vine the quick the um more nutrients
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
it loses by the time it gets to your
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
plate so if you can get food grown
 
04:53:47.230 --> 04:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
closer to home it maintains more of its
 
04:53:47.240 --> 04:53:51.670 align:start position:0%
closer to home it maintains more of its
nutrition

04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:54:00.670 --> 04:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um I seem to
 
04:54:05.070 --> 04:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
remember in uh fiscal some time ago uh
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with a government gr uh grant
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
that was basically for the same program
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that yes I I sure am I
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
think we talking about we refer to the
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders refer to as the Cooperative
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
agreement and there was half a million
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
dollars that we were able to get from
 
04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government um after after we
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
tried to um get the local Farm to school
 
04:54:33.190 --> 04:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
program last time then um some folks in
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit sector worked very hard um
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
to turn around a Grant application real
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
quickly and we got that $500,000 grant
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
for um specific schools mostly I think
 
04:54:46.590 --> 04:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
maybe entirely schools that have a
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of folks in the free
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch program but that
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
program is a short a very short program
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
and then that um goes away my
 
04:54:58.868 --> 04:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is whether or not we spend
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
all the money um although hopefully the
 
04:55:04.390 --> 04:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
schools will be able to but but um
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough because we got that
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement and the Department
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture is already administering
 
04:55:10.080 --> 04:55:10.830 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture is already administering
that

04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
then they felt comfortable um taking on
 
04:55:16.270 --> 04:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
a pilot program that would help schools
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
um a pilot in every County um so that
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
they could the timing works out such
 
04:55:24.510 --> 04:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
that the Cooperative agreement ends and
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
then the pilot program would begin and
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
they would hopefully the department will
 
04:55:30.830 --> 04:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
be able
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
to use some of their knowledge having
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
worked out some kinks in The Cooperative
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
agreement in order to go forward with
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
the pilot program with
 
04:55:41.948 --> 04:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
ease that
 
04:55:44.430 --> 04:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
clarify thank you
 
04:55:47.070 --> 04:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so the Department of Agriculture
 
04:55:49.548 --> 04:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
they're supportive of your yes yes they
 
04:55:52.830 --> 04:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
are represent cells thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh would you happen to know what
 
04:55:56.670 --> 04:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of that 500,000 went to
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually buying the agricultural
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
products for the kids uh as opposed to
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
administrative costs I do not I am not
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
that deep in the weeds of the
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement um 100% there is
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
no money
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
allow s if you could just come up and
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
use the mic please we might be getting
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
into the questions that Stacy Perlo is
 
04:56:19.390 --> 04:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
the administrator for the farm to school
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
program I was going to say that but I
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
didn't want to jump ahead of us yeah
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
Food are there any further
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions all right I guess you're both
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
off the
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
hook would you like to hear from would
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
that be helpful to hear from the arm to
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
school administrator well we're we try
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
to just focus on financial matters and
 
04:56:48.910 --> 04:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
we're running a little behind schedule
 
04:56:50.190 --> 04:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
in a sense although we have something
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
coming up at three but um we know that
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
it was supported out a committee I think
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
but great by 17 to three votes so we're
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
good on the policy apparently great well
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
um if you have Financial
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions were helpful I mean if you
 
04:57:09.310 --> 04:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
have any more money questions were
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
helpful hopeful are able to hopefully
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
take those as well all right so are
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
there any money questions Financial
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions about how the money's been
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
used in the past for any such program is
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
this an entirely new program this has
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
never ever been done before right right
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's never been done in New Hampshire
 
04:57:30.350 --> 04:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
but other states have similar programs
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
wer I remember my local school district
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
doing some of this and just putting the
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
word out to anybody that had excess food
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
please bring it in so it's
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
locally okay rep represent McGuire thank
 
04:57:51.628 --> 04:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
you how will the schools that are
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
picked yeah sure that's um in the bill
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture will be um
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
will be coming up with I mean there's
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
some details outlined in the bill and
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture will form
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
you all set so presumably then there
 
04:58:18.390 --> 04:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
must be administrative costs right
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
because they they'll have to do things
 
04:58:24.110 --> 04:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
to contact schools and do other things
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
oh I was talking about the Cooperative
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
agreement didn't have any administrative
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
costs oh I see so of this money it's not
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
100% Going to
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
food now this money does also support a
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
halftime coordinator position that would
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
be outsourced from the Department of a
 
04:58:41.840 --> 04:58:42.750 align:start position:0%

okay we'll open up the work session on
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1633 three relative to the
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
legalization and regulation of cannabis
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
and making Appropriations
 
05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
therefore this came out of the Commerce
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
Committee on to pass as
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
amended uh and had a division vote and
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
the division yeah division vote 239 to
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.548 --> 05:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
amended so do we have someone here
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's a sponsor of the bill that would
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record my
 
05:09:19.230 --> 05:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
name is Erica Leon I'm a state
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative out of dairy I'm um and
 
05:09:24.430 --> 05:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor of this bill this
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
bill Builds on quite a bit of work in
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
the past um initially we um there was
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 which passed last year by
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
a resounding level but clearly was shot
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
down um once it left our body because
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
there was a list of requirements that
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be included in the bill in
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
order for it to pass and become law
 
05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
there were 10 items there that we large
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we largely addressed and then there
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
were two additional ones that came out
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
of um the Work Commission so I was
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually the chairman of the committee
 
05:09:58.830 --> 05:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
of conference that created the study
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
group for to study the state run model
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
for the legalization of cannabis we had
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
actually charged that commission with
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
coming out with legislation that
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
commission failed to produ UC
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to be introduced to the
 
05:10:14.110 --> 05:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
house um I recognize what a challenge it
 
05:10:15.628 --> 05:10:15.638 align:start position:0%
is if it was easy this would have been
 
05:10:18.510 --> 05:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
done many many many years ago but I
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
think that when we look to the different
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
points of view we need to understand the
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
path of all of these I never intended
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to represent the commission's
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
work I expected that they would file
 
05:10:30.750 --> 05:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
their bill but in good faith I have been
 
05:10:33.070 --> 05:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
working closer and closer and closer to
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
those guidelines implementing as many
 
05:10:37.788 --> 05:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
items that were found in the commiss
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
found in the work of the commission
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
and trying to get to a good bill that
 
05:10:44.350 --> 05:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
can actually make it all the way to
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
law two of the challenges uh that were
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
noted from the bill that's already
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
passed the house is that we had what
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
some might call a soft 15 store limit we
 
05:10:56.190 --> 05:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
had a 15 store limit but we laid out a
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
pathway to which that could expand um at
 
05:11:02.350 --> 05:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
the last commission meeting the one of
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's Representatives came in
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and said that we need to have um we need
 
05:11:09.670 --> 05:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
to move slowly we may increase or
 
05:11:10.990 --> 05:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of stores but we
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
need to move slowly we had taken that in
 
05:11:14.830 --> 05:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
with that language I have an amendment
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
it hasn't gone through OS but you have
 
05:11:19.470 --> 05:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
my very expensive color Staples copy of
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
what I submitted to OS so that it's a
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
little bit easier to track what's in
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
there I also have a road map for you so
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
you can see what we have so now it's a
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
hard limit um there's also there was a
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
request for a ban on lobbying and
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
political contributions from any lensey
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
I see some First Amendment issues with
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
that but if it's possible the Secretary
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
of state would know how to do that so
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended to ask the
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to um to come up with
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
rules in order to give that restriction
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
because that was one of the one of the
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
last minute requirements that came in
 
05:11:56.750 --> 05:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
and led to the commission to study the
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
state run cannabis model not being able
 
05:12:01.150 --> 05:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
to meet their charge Duty because they
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
were presented with two items at the
 
05:12:02.638 --> 05:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
were presented with two items at the
last

05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
minute so the amendment that I have for
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
you has those two changes
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
um and then it also has some other
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
clarifications we had removed the Dual
 
05:12:15.788 --> 05:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
use therapeutic cannabis I know some of
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is policy but some of it really
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
adds to the cost um we had removed the
 
05:12:23.230 --> 05:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
Dual use therapeutic um license and
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
there are some other areas where it
 
05:12:26.230 --> 05:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
comes back in there's some clarification
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
and advisory cleaning up definitions and
 
05:12:30.190 --> 05:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
loose ends that's why it has the number
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
of pages that I have but most of those
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
are ones that are well within the scope
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
of of just specifying these one that's
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
large is that the fine of $100 on the
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
first offense of public consumption the
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
$100 fine had not been included so it
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually could be up to ,000 fine and
 
05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's a potential of somebody actually
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
spending some time in a Cell um I'm not
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how long but if we don't
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
specify that there is that risk and that
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
would have a higher cost to the state as
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
well as a cost to the individuals
 
05:13:04.830 --> 05:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
obviously um the the restrictions that
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
we have on public consumption really are
 
05:13:08.350 --> 05:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
designed so that we're not like some of
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
these other states when you walk down
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
the street and instead of smelling
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoke you're smelling cannabis
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
smoke all the time that's just not
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
acceptable you know even for people who
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
are consuming it you shouldn't be
 
05:13:20.590 --> 05:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
forcing that on
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
others so I guess the big question the
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
gorilla in the room is do I believe that
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
this meets the requirements to become
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
law and I do Minnesota enacted a
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
state-run model and as I looked at their
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and their rul making it is
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
very very similar to this agency store
 
05:13:41.788 --> 05:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
model that you have here in front of you
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
um when we've heard commentary about
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
what bills would work I've never seen a
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
strong Embrace of the franchise model
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
which I know is the alternative option
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's being pursued because there has
 
05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
been no clear Embrace of the franchise
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
model I think it's our duty in this body
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do the best work that we can here and
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
then if there are others that have a
 
05:14:06.270 --> 05:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
different perspective let them let them
 
05:14:08.350 --> 05:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
see if it makes sense to change it
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
change it over the
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
Senate right here we have a chance to
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
finally end Prohibition in a way that
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
will not grow the market very much
 
05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:14:22.510 --> 05:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
advertising you know how large did the
 
05:14:24.910 --> 05:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
illegal cannabis Market grow without any
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
advertising I don't think this Market
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
needs any sort of billboards or anything
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
else but it does allow people to reach
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
out look for it find it in Industry
 
05:14:35.948 --> 05:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
Publications and
 
05:14:38.230 --> 05:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
whatnot so basically what I'm asking you
 
05:14:42.910 --> 05:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
to do is to work with me as we move to
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
make those final finishing touches on
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
this agency store modeled Bill one that
 
05:14:53.070 --> 05:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
will be able to breathe and grow over
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
time with the state as we see what a
 
05:14:58.230 --> 05:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
mature cannabis Market looks like my
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
concern with the other Alternative
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
Market is that once you put in a
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
franchise once you put in a limited
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
market where the government designates
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
who can
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
participate and the prices that can be
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
set I'm an economist that is the
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
definition of a cartel we don't want to
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
create a cartel like OPEC in New
 
05:15:21.990 --> 05:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we want to do what would
 
05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
be the best way to be able to adapt over
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
time would it be have a very very
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
tightly regulated tightly controlled
 
05:15:32.590 --> 05:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
agency store modeled plan like you have
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
before you this is our best way to
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
thread that
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
needle and
 
05:15:41.548 --> 05:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
reduce those undue influences just like
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
you see in the illicit market today why
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
create that in the legal market so with
 
05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any
 
05:15:51.548 --> 05:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
so the document that you provided us uh
 
05:15:58.548 --> 05:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
outlining your goals that's highlighted
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
that you referenced this has not been
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
submitted to the uh OS folks yet for
 
05:16:06.750 --> 05:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
drafting or it has um yes so that one
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
was submitted to them but um given given
 
05:16:10.270 --> 05:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
that there's so many committees that are
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get some finalized work they
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get that in time for
 
05:16:16.030 --> 05:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
this work session but it is in process
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
cuz we're under some time constraint as
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
well so getting these documents today uh
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
kind of pushes us back a little bit and
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
I was just handed a document that
 
05:16:26.750 --> 05:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
apparently is coming from the Senate
 
05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
side on the same issue so um just to
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
make you aware that um we're going to
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
try to get to this as fast as we can but
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
there are a number of questions on the
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
bill the amendment that's before us
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
which won't take in well may take into
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of your comments and suggestions
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
but we have a number of questions and
 
05:16:47.310 --> 05:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refer to representative
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire to start thank you Mr chairman
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for coming um
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
you talked about the agency model this
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
is the franchise model and then a third
 
05:17:03.548 --> 05:17:03.558 align:start position:0%
possibility would be uh just run like
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission with you know like
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
sell sell it just like they sell alcohol
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
um for for you for you personally would
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
you support the bill if it ended up in
 
05:17:18.990 --> 05:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
any of those three ways or not um I
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
prefer the thank you for the question I
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
prefer this model I would be fine with
 
05:17:26.430 --> 05:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
an actual State operated system where
 
05:17:28.270 --> 05:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
it's just like our existing Liquor
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
Stores um just like the bill that passed
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
last term with a 13 vote margin I think
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the potential problems with the
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
franchise model are so large especially
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
because then you get the franchise board
 
05:17:41.830 --> 05:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
involved if you have one of the
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
franchises or somebody at a franchisee
 
05:17:46.990 --> 05:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
that slips has a problem then you're
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
bringing in a federal agency that has
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
not been dealing with cannabis whether
 
05:17:53.070 --> 05:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
or not they decide that the state of New
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the franchise or is liable
 
05:17:58.270 --> 05:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not they Des decide that they
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
want to investigate our Communications
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
and Records whether or not they want to
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
put a freeze on the assets of the State
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for any potential
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
settlement we don't know we know know
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
how those agencies that already interact
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
with the Cannabis Market act but
 
05:18:15.070 --> 05:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
bringing in the franchise model just
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
brings a huge amount of risk and if
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to go that way let's just go
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
whole hog and do the state run stores
 
05:18:24.030 --> 05:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
because that way at least there's
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
transparency thank you I'll give you
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a copy of thisk
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
question represent sweene thank you Mr
 
05:18:33.628 --> 05:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
being here in your work on this
 
05:18:36.670 --> 05:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
obviously you alluded to the history of
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
this topic uh at the beginning of your
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
talk we need a bill that gets 2011 house
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
votes 13 Senate votes and gets signed by
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
one person mhm does this get signed by
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
that one person yes I believe that it
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
can and I will continue talking with him
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
through next week to try and get him to
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
have a firm statement of yes but he
 
05:18:59.070 --> 05:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
wanted a state-run model um he talked
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
about State control so looking into the
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
liquor model New Hampshire is one of the
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
highest control control States as
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to open States for liquor there
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
are many control states that have a
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
touch that's very similar to this
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
throughout their system followup Mr
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for that have you
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
talked to him about this proposal I've
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
been trying I hope that I can get a
 
05:19:21.150 --> 05:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
chance to actually speak with him I've
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
been doing my best all right thank you
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
very much and if anybody can help me get
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
in with him I would appreciate that
 
05:19:26.000 --> 05:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
in with him I would appreciate that
thank

05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
questions I have a
 
05:19:35.708 --> 05:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
few so I'm looking at the draft that we
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
have of your bill as it came out of
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
Commerce and that's where my questions
 
05:19:44.590 --> 05:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
are focused um one of the biggest
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
concerns I have is the cost obviously
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's the finance committee and cost of
 
05:19:51.628 --> 05:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
what we look at now I did read the 124
 
05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
pages of the commission report and they
 
05:19:55.948 --> 05:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
had different numbers for cost of
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
implementing what they had suggested
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
upwards of $18 million in this amendment
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
that we have that came from Commerce
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's a line for $8 million for
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
General funds to get this started is
 
05:20:08.878 --> 05:20:10.350 align:start position:0%
General funds to get this started is
another

05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to get it
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
started obviously that's General funds
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
which concern us it's not the Liquor
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
Commission you know paying for it even
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
though it's the same part of money what
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission gives us goes into
 
05:20:24.030 --> 05:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
the general
 
05:20:24.040 --> 05:20:25.788 align:start position:0%
the general
fund

05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
but your proposal is that still the $8
 
05:20:34.430 --> 05:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
million or is it less amount required
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
from the state to implement the your
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
franchise proposal um thank you so this
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
this is the agency control it would
 
05:20:45.390 --> 05:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
simply have a higher level of control um
 
05:20:48.990 --> 05:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
than in the 639 bill um it may make
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
sense to it'll it's one of those areas
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
where we want to try and break it down I
 
05:20:56.590 --> 05:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
do know that um Mr Mike Hol from the
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
has a little bit more refinement for
 
05:21:02.190 --> 05:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
some of the positions required for the
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
data um data in the data collection
 
05:21:08.110 --> 05:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's required but as we look at this
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at Ru making at this
 
05:21:12.670 --> 05:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
point um before we'd be well into next
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
bium by the time that we start moving
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
past the ru making and and those
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
processes well you raise a good point as
 
05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
far as timing because our folks at the
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
LBA have looked at the time to get the
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
rules put in place and it could be
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
upwards of 20 months and during that
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
time there'd be a lot of cost that the
 
05:21:35.310 --> 05:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
state would bear as far as Enforcement
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
Officers rules the folks you know
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
developing rules whether it's a Liquor
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
Commission or something else is
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
developed so there's a lot of cost here
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to get our hands on
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
and just again we try not to go into
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
policy but this is quite an issue and
 
05:21:52.350 --> 05:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
we've got all these different things
 
05:21:55.150 --> 05:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
before us that aren't going before now a
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
policy committee obviously we're not
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to kick this back your proposal
 
05:22:00.510 --> 05:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
back to Commerce so it's going to be
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
here for us to look at but looking again
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the amended version that was provided
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
to us uh after the House vote the
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's some troubling language at least
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
for me and uh should it be the Liquor
 
05:22:19.708 --> 05:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
21 the commission shall appoint liquor
 
05:22:25.230 --> 05:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
investigators who primary whose primary
 
05:22:28.110 --> 05:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
function shall be the proper prosecution
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
chapter uh the liquor investigators
 
05:22:36.990 --> 05:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
shall have statewide
 
05:22:40.350 --> 05:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as far as a reference of U
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
reference to enforcement of all laws
 
05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
either in the co uh cooperation with or
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
independently of officers of any town or
 
05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
County so this is giving the Liquor
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
Commission the authority to go into any
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
Town any County without notifying the
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
local police officials of their
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
activities that kind of stuck out to me
 
05:23:04.350 --> 05:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
is something that I don't think we want
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
to do but any comments from you on that
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
well I think that that is maybe a great
 
05:23:11.868 --> 05:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
refinement this um as being a
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative process over so many years
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
um just talking with all the different
 
05:23:17.390 --> 05:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders everybody that's involved
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
in it that wasn't one of the areas that
 
05:23:22.110 --> 05:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me but if you have a way
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we can better re them in while
 
05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the authority
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
that they need I would be very
 
05:23:30.270 --> 05:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
interested um if you give me some
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
direction trying to find some correct
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
language to include into an amendment
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
for next week now in addition to that on
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
the next page on on um page 11 it talks
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
about whether the commission has the
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
authority to suspend revoke licenses and
 
05:23:49.230 --> 05:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
it says this can be done without any
 
05:23:49.240 --> 05:23:50.310 align:start position:0%
it says this can be done without any
hearing

05:23:50.310 --> 05:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it seems to me when we have
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the do conducting hearings on violations
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
so that any agency within state
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
government has a setup so if someone's
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
AG grieved by their decision they can
 
05:24:05.948 --> 05:24:05.958 align:start position:0%
have a hearing just as the um Lottery
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
Commission had with a casino here in
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing which the person was
 
05:24:12.750 --> 05:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh grieved by their decision could
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
testify and bring his lawyers or
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives this would not allow
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
that so if the commissioner just says
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
sets someone in suspension mode that's
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
it there's no hearing or appeal process
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
is that something that you address in
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
your new proposal so this is an area
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
where the government takes a much
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
stronger hand than they do in the
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
gambling um when you look at that with
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
the gaming commission it's that's the
 
05:24:39.868 --> 05:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of State involvement but
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a higher level of stra State
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
involvement the state may not be
 
05:24:45.230 --> 05:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
operating those stores but what the
 
05:24:47.310 --> 05:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
state giveth the state can take away in
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
this so by doing that we have a Liquor
 
05:24:52.350 --> 05:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
Commission and liquor enforcement that
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
are very good at their jobs and they're
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
used to managing when somebody goes
 
05:24:57.750 --> 05:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the rules and the laws and by
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
doing that they're able to make sure
 
05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the people who are operating under
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
their Authority are doing what they are
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that's one way that we
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
can have the assurance that without
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
having that Financial tie through either
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
operating it or having that fiduciary
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
relation relationship of a franchise
 
05:25:17.948 --> 05:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
that we know that the state will be able
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
to exercise appropriate control on them
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
should this Market mature and reach a
 
05:25:25.150 --> 05:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
point where it can become a little bit
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
less tightly connected as it would be in
 
05:25:30.030 --> 05:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
this law it might make sense in the
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
future to change that but right now the
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
whole intention isn't to raise a baby
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
and throw him out onto the free range
 
05:25:37.948 --> 05:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
the whole point is to keep that baby
 
05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
close to you make sure that it's very
 
05:25:42.510 --> 05:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
close to the state as this Market starts
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
getting up takes its first steps and
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
starts to see what the world around it
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
is as it becomes more mature we can it
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
we can as a legislature look at giving
 
05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
them a little bit more space to operate
 
05:25:55.150 --> 05:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
but keeping it tightly controlled to
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
start I think is one of the big ways
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
that we address the requirement for
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
state run control for the governor now
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at Massachusetts I believe
 
05:26:06.430 --> 05:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
they have five Commissioners and they
 
05:26:08.830 --> 05:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
have a cannabis commission all separate
 
05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
from liquor nobody else and if you take
 
05:26:13.510 --> 05:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
a look at one of their maps of all their
 
05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
stores around the state they're all
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
along our border on the side that just
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
from Salem you can go to methan or havil
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
or anywhere and this 15 store limit to
 
05:26:28.590 --> 05:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
me it just sounds excuse me like a
 
05:26:31.390 --> 05:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
disaster um because you've already got
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
all these stores out there in the
 
05:26:35.110 --> 05:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
Restriction of 15 stores in the state
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
within a population base of 15,000
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
th000 that's Manchester may get eight
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
stores or conquered five what about the
 
05:26:47.548 --> 05:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
other communities like uh ammer Milford
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
Peterboro that have less than 15,000
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
people are all the stores going to wind
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
up in the bigger communities so those
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
people that live in the surrounding
 
05:26:57.310 --> 05:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
small towns would just go over to
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont M or Massachusetts to buy their
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis um so the language and what
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
passed the house says that a
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
municipality can have one or one per
 
05:27:09.750 --> 05:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
15,000 people but right the issue of ma
 
05:27:12.510 --> 05:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nash and conquered means that
 
05:27:14.430 --> 05:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
those concentrations can basically take
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
up the entire capacity and that doesn't
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
make sense the amendment that I have in
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
drafting for you says that
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities may have two if they have
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
a population of over 30,000 or have one
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
because we're launching it with such a
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
small number of stores if people wanted
 
05:27:31.628 --> 05:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
to keep it to one per municipality I
 
05:27:34.270 --> 05:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
would understand that too also you
 
05:27:35.750 --> 05:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
brought up a great point with all of the
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
crossb stores if we only have stores
 
05:27:40.590 --> 05:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot more attractive
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
for them to be in areas that aren't
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
served with that crossb flow I've
 
05:27:46.110 --> 05:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually gone and I've went into a lot
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
of dispensaries both in border states
 
05:27:49.628 --> 05:27:49.638 align:start position:0%
and in other states to understand how
 
05:27:51.390 --> 05:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
this Market works and what it actually
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
looks like instead of just trying to
 
05:27:56.310 --> 05:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
read reports and whenever you drive by
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
half of the plates or more are from New
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so clearly the people who live
 
05:28:02.590 --> 05:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
near the borders already have access to
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's they're not buying on
 
05:28:05.948 --> 05:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
the street from the illegal cartels with
 
05:28:08.110 --> 05:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
the potential of contamination from f
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
senel because of that because it's so
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
tightly restricted it's quite possible
 
05:28:14.910 --> 05:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see stores pop up in
 
05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
the areas that aren't quite as well
 
05:28:19.150 --> 05:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
reached by the borders if it's more
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
competitive to be near a border because
 
05:28:23.708 --> 05:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
we have half the tax or not tax whatever
 
05:28:25.990 --> 05:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
you want to call it rate then that's one
 
05:28:27.750 --> 05:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
thing but I could really really see it
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
being more competitive having some of
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
these up in the mountains having them in
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
areas where people will come to because
 
05:28:35.070 --> 05:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
they're on their pathway you're coming
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
to explore the mountains you're coming
 
05:28:38.270 --> 05:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
to enjoy the beauty and nature of New
 
05:28:40.350 --> 05:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and quite a few people who are
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
into Outdoor Sports would really like to
 
05:28:44.510 --> 05:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
buy some New Hampshire specific product
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
to enjoy in the woods as well so um
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
that's one of the areas where I think
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of in my mind honestly I
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
do think 15 store limits kind of a bug
 
05:28:55.868 --> 05:28:55.878 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer not to have it but it also
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
creates some hard conversations about
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
what works best and I think that we're
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably will find that we're going to
 
05:29:03.670 --> 05:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
better suit the actual New Hampshire
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
Market by having those constraints on it
 
05:29:09.868 --> 05:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just opening it up
 
05:29:11.788 --> 05:29:11.798 align:start position:0%
now is your proposal there's a proposal
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the Commerce amended version that
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
requires people to be a resident for
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
three years which caught my attention it
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem fair like if say
 
05:29:19.798 --> 05:29:20.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem fair like if say
representative

05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
Maguire's sibling decided to move to New
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he or she couldn't sell
 
05:29:27.310 --> 05:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis for three years or get a
 
05:29:29.548 --> 05:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
franchise I I don't know how that holds
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
up as far as people's right I mean you
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
can run as a state legislator just
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
moving into the state and signing up in
 
05:29:38.910 --> 05:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
June or whatever so where did is that in
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
your proposal that someone has to be a
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
resident for three years before they can
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
get a franchise it is and don't we have
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be a resident for two years before we
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
filed a run not necessarily in our
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
specific town but we need to be in New
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for two
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
years a lot of I've been here all my
 
05:29:55.390 --> 05:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
life so I guess I didn't know that a lot
 
05:29:57.868 --> 05:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
of that is just because we want this to
 
05:30:00.670 --> 05:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
be a classy craft cannabis sort of look
 
05:30:02.750 --> 05:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't want to have
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
Mad Men all of the big chains coming in
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
here and just squashing our market and
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
making it look like a McDonald
 
05:30:10.510 --> 05:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to go to something
 
05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
where it feels like you're at a 7-Eleven
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're at any sort of um basic
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
utilitarian store where there's not
 
05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
really anything that makes it special
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
then let all the large um they're not
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
really multi-state because you can't be
 
05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
multi-state because of the federal
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
requirements but in essence they are
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
because they have somebody operating in
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
each of these states and they're using
 
05:30:36.350 --> 05:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
um franchised franchise names um this is
 
05:30:38.310 --> 05:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
to keep it New Hampshire specific
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not about crowding us out
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges other states have
 
05:30:43.548 --> 05:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
seen are when people come in from out of
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
state come in flood the market and then
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
they crash the market and they take
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
people out of
 
05:30:50.590 --> 05:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
competition that's one of the big
 
05:30:52.030 --> 05:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
reasons to have the residency
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
requirement then again it's been going
 
05:30:55.230 --> 05:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
on so long maybe some of those people
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
have already moved in and gotten a home
 
05:30:59.548 --> 05:30:59.558 align:start position:0%
and they're voting with us too who knows
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
but uh I want to try and protect this
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
market and make it be for New Hampshire
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
and not just have us be yet another
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
place that's feeding money to some out
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
of state location it's not about big
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis I just have one more and we'll
 
05:31:13.548 --> 05:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
let the other members speak up but one
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal notes noted that in the
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
first year after things really got
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
worked out the state may realize about
 
05:31:23.270 --> 05:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
4.9 million the next year 6.9 million in
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
the meantime this general fund is
 
05:31:27.510 --> 05:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
funding this right along and it could
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
take you know more than two or three
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
years but this before the state even
 
05:31:33.948 --> 05:31:33.958 align:start position:0%
realizes any return let alone the
 
05:31:36.030 --> 05:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
payback the general funds that would be
 
05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
used to get this up and run
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's just a concern that I have there's
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
a long layover before the state really
 
05:31:45.628 --> 05:31:45.638 align:start position:0%
realizes any Revenue state of Maine I
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
think averages 13 to 15 million a year
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
in Revenue
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's one of the areas
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
where I really truly deeply share one of
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
the goals of the governor to focus on
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction over profits um one of
 
05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the biggest problems we have is people
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
who already use cannabis because most
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
people who are going to start using it
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law will be the people
 
05:32:13.230 --> 05:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
who either already were using it or
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
there're such rule followers they are
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
waiting for us to make it totally legal
 
05:32:17.548 --> 05:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:32:19.628 --> 05:32:19.638 align:start position:0%
decriminalized so you have people who
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
currently use cannabis and if they're
 
05:32:23.548 --> 05:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
not driving out of state they're buying
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
from somebody in the elicit Market
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's intentional to get somebody
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
hooked on the other product lines or
 
05:32:32.110 --> 05:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
just because of poor product handling we
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
have seen people overdose and die from
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl because cannabis that they
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
bought on the street had fental in it a
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
woman in my town lost her son to that
 
05:32:42.270 --> 05:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
and that was in the opioid review
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
commission so it is happening and it's
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
not just one of these boogey men but
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
beyond that it's about making it so that
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
we build a model slowly I'd love to open
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
up the gates and have it be something
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
where it's going to become cost neutral
 
05:32:59.070 --> 05:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
to a benefit to our taxpayers sooner but
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's not what's there's no pathway
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
like that in front of us that I can see
 
05:33:05.788 --> 05:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
unless we are bringing in investors and
 
05:33:09.310 --> 05:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
having investors invest in a state run
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
model um whether you're investing in a
 
05:33:14.350 --> 05:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
franchise and expecting a future return
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
on that investment you know that that
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
state company partnership makes me a
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
little bit uncomfortable especially on a
 
05:33:25.070 --> 05:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
product like this and especially when um
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's all sorts of federal
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
statutes about colluding to violate
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
federal laws and while nobody's been
 
05:33:33.430 --> 05:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
gone after over Rico over cannabis the
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
closer we get the state into the
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
business relationship as opposed to the
 
05:33:39.150 --> 05:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory relationship the more danger
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
we bring so as a regulatory body it's
 
05:33:43.868 --> 05:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
very very clear that the state can
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
enforce business res regulations and
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
health and safety regulations most of
 
05:33:50.990 --> 05:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
what we're worried about is health and
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
safety so that doesn't get us into any
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
challenging areas with the federal
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
government but I am very very concerned
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
that the franchise would even if that
 
05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
means that in that investment companies
 
05:34:03.670 --> 05:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
are going to be funding some of the
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
early development I don't want to trade
 
05:34:07.948 --> 05:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
off the future of this market and build
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
a cartel in New Hampshire just because
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
of that and I'm not trying to offend
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
anybody from say from Cartel I'm an
 
05:34:16.230 --> 05:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
economist I get to the sort of core
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
principles on what it is but when you
 
05:34:19.868 --> 05:34:19.878 align:start position:0%
have a relationship between the state
 
05:34:22.430 --> 05:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the only businesses who can do it
 
05:34:25.868 --> 05:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
that is de facto what it is I appreciate
 
05:34:28.350 --> 05:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
your tenacity on this issue uh I do have
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
further questions but I'd like to allow
 
05:34:32.310 --> 05:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to ask a few represent cim
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
Bells anything yes thank you Mr chair um
 
05:34:37.230 --> 05:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say with some of the
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendments depending that we would not
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
charge any tax on this or uh so um I
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
said tax because the governor doesn't
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
want it to be taxed it's an agency fee
 
05:34:52.150 --> 05:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
so at our 10% agency fee we'd be a
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
little less than a quarter of what
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
California has which is why it has such
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
a supercharged elicit market and a
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
little under half of what Massachusetts
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
has which is one of the reasons that
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're still struggling with a lot of
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
the illicit Market I actually spoke to
 
05:35:07.150 --> 05:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
some enforcement agents when I was just
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
driving down to check out the Tings Boro
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
store and I asked them what their
 
05:35:12.270 --> 05:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
biggest problem was and they said our
 
05:35:14.430 --> 05:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
tax rate is is too high it's probably
 
05:35:16.590 --> 05:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
about two times as high as it should be
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
for our Market because there's a lot of
 
05:35:19.788 --> 05:35:19.798 align:start position:0%
people that aren't coming to the stores
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're still going to the dealers on
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
the street okay followup Mr year so with
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
a 10% rate fee whatever you want to call
 
05:35:28.990 --> 05:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
it do you think that that'll be
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
competitive enough to com obviously you
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
can compete with Massachusetts what but
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
how about the illicit Market how close
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
are you to the illicit Market do you
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
have you guys done studies on that um so
 
05:35:42.990 --> 05:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
the elicit Market has a sporadic 100%
 
05:35:45.390 --> 05:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
taxation rate because if they lose all
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
of their products it's taxed at 100% And
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
same with their customers um 10% is very
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
competitive with other states although I
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
forget exactly which state but somebody
 
05:35:56.750 --> 05:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
just introduced 8% there is a cannabis
 
05:35:59.070 --> 05:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that's created as
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
part of this and one of the things that
 
05:36:03.230 --> 05:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
they do is look at the tax rate so if we
 
05:36:06.670 --> 05:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
find that it doesn't seem that we are
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
keeping moving some of the sales from
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
either on the street or out of state
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
into those stores that would be a good
 
05:36:15.070 --> 05:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
reason to look at either if it's the tax
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
rate the product offerings and try and
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
understand why the state didn't get the
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
market dynamics right the first time
 
05:36:24.830 --> 05:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly you can't uh make
 
05:36:26.830 --> 05:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
business Decisions by Committee Action
 
05:36:29.070 --> 05:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
very well um but it'll give them a
 
05:36:30.590 --> 05:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
pathway in order to give us
 
05:36:32.350 --> 05:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how to do that
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and get it in in better
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
sync with the actual Market
 
05:36:36.520 --> 05:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
sync with the actual Market
cycle

05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
05:36:38.080 --> 05:36:38.788 align:start position:0%
cycle
thank

05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Sweeney you have
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
far you've given us a lot to read for
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure now you you mentioned you'd like to
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
see The Liquor Commission basically run
 
05:37:00.628 --> 05:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
this have you support got their support
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
for your suggestion or proposal um so
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
I've want to make sure that I'm not
 
05:37:08.430 --> 05:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
attributing words that didn't come out
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
of somebody's word mouth to them um what
 
05:37:12.990 --> 05:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
I do want to say is that when I've
 
05:37:14.788 --> 05:37:14.798 align:start position:0%
spoken with them it has seemed like it
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
would be generally agreeable I can do
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
some work uh before you have your next
 
05:37:20.670 --> 05:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
work session and try and figure out
 
05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
exactly if you give me a list of
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you want me to check with I
 
05:37:25.910 --> 05:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
will take it there I will do the
 
05:37:28.390 --> 05:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
homework I will confirm exactly what I
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
hear from them and uh let you know what
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
their perspectives are and also do any
 
05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
necessary tweaks in order to make it
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
work for them as
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
well yeah under the proposal again the
 
05:37:41.110 --> 05:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce version I think I counted about
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
29 positions that would need to be
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
funded pretty shortly after if the
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bill's passed um do you have an idea how
 
05:37:51.470 --> 05:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
many people your proposal would require
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
from liquor or um thank you for the
 
05:37:56.470 --> 05:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
question my I I did write the one that
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
came out of Commerce that is my bill
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I've been working on the Amendments
 
05:38:03.788 --> 05:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
that I have um they deal with moving to
 
05:38:05.628 --> 05:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
the hard limit of 15 empowering the
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State the fine on the first
 
05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
offense clarifying some of the age
 
05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
restriction restrictions flow through of
 
05:38:15.150 --> 05:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
removal of dual use um one of the things
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
that was highlighted was our volatile
 
05:38:19.548 --> 05:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
compound extraction that was in there we
 
05:38:21.070 --> 05:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
actually needed to specify it a little
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
bit more because some of the ways of
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
extracting it actually do need to be
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
done in a more controlled way so we
 
05:38:28.270 --> 05:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
added that into the definitions and set
 
05:38:30.310 --> 05:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
the requirements clarification in the
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
advisory committee cleaning up
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and then um there just the
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
change back to saying is liquor
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
commission instead of the liquor and
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission so this is not a
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
large departure from what passed
 
05:38:46.510 --> 05:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce what I'm suggesting is just a
 
05:38:50.270 --> 05:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
few changes um a few small changes
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
because they were there was also the
 
05:38:55.150 --> 05:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
deadline there in order to work forward
 
05:38:58.270 --> 05:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
um and also I'd be very happy to figure
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
out how to work um with whoever I can in
 
05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
order to get so sharpen our pencil a
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more on the costs and the
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
expenses quite frankly this is the first
 
05:39:09.070 --> 05:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill of mine that I brought into Finance
 
05:39:10.468 --> 05:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
so I could have a little bit of
 
05:39:12.510 --> 05:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
education and making sure that I'm
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
bringing you exactly what you need and
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to put that work in for you
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um so the reason why I'm so adamant that
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's this model and if we need to go so
 
05:39:23.830 --> 05:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
something more tightly controlled it's
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
the state actually operating it is
 
05:39:27.708 --> 05:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
because the franchise model is just
 
05:39:29.350 --> 05:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
something that I will not be able to
 
05:39:31.628 --> 05:39:31.638 align:start position:0%
support at all that's why I'm putting in
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
this work that's why I've been trying to
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
get to something where we all can come
 
05:39:38.430 --> 05:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
to agreement 2011 reps 13 senators and
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
one other guy so that we can actually
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
get this done and I'm going to keep
 
05:39:43.708 --> 05:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
working as long as you give me more time
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
in the deadline in order to meet all of
 
05:39:45.478 --> 05:39:46.750 align:start position:0%
in the deadline in order to meet all of
your

05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
requirements so I do have a couple of
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions just looking at uh
 
05:39:55.110 --> 05:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
going to page 32 there's a reference to
 
05:39:58.510 --> 05:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
a statute RSA
 
05:40:02.590 --> 05:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
77- on line 24 as far as the Department
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration I could not
 
05:40:08.270 --> 05:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
find that um in my searches so I'm not
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
sure maybe it's just a misprint or
 
05:40:13.628 --> 05:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
somebody typed the wrong number but if
 
05:40:16.510 --> 05:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
you could check that out okay
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
um I will absolutely catch that I
 
05:40:20.190 --> 05:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
thought I tried to follow each of those
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
breadcrumbs and thank you for catching
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
one for me page
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
was and then going to page 44 again the
 
05:40:38.590 --> 05:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
money aspect um on page 44 line 14 it
 
05:40:41.708 --> 05:40:41.718 align:start position:0%
talks about the sum of
 
05:40:45.390 --> 05:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
$500,000 uh for the bium ending in
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
2025 for treatment prevention Recovery
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
Fund um it doesn't say where that money
 
05:40:53.750 --> 05:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
is coming from doesn't say it's being
 
05:40:55.948 --> 05:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
drawn in a warrant by the governor
 
05:40:58.390 --> 05:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
coming with a general fund somewhere so
 
05:41:00.510 --> 05:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
we need to know where that particular
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
amount of money half a million dollars
 
05:41:04.868 --> 05:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
is coming from okay thank you I can find
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
where that would come from and that's
 
05:41:09.510 --> 05:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
simply to make sure any any increase of
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
interest because we're talking about it
 
05:41:13.548 --> 05:41:13.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't lead to people um needing these
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
services and making sure that we're
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
taking care of those people already
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
already using um before we move into
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
this now I'm going back through you had
 
05:41:24.990 --> 05:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
a list of percentages going to like the
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
education fund I think was like 65% or
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
something but there were a whole list of
 
05:41:32.830 --> 05:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
um folks that
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
would 33 that would
 
05:41:36.240 --> 05:41:43.310 align:start position:0%
would 33 that would
benefit

05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:47.110 --> 05:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
um okay starting on line five on page
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
33 uh as you know we have the drug and
 
05:41:54.110 --> 05:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund already so I was curious
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
about developing this new
 
05:41:57.120 --> 05:41:59.150 align:start position:0%
about developing this new
fund

05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:42:03.548 --> 05:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
um let's see under on line 27 the
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
substance Ed prevention treatment
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
recovering fund established
 
05:42:12.030 --> 05:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
because we already have under rsa's 176
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
colon 16 Roman 3 the drug and alcohol
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
fund so You' you be looking to create
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
even another fund and I'm thinking
 
05:42:21.830 --> 05:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you just send it to the
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
governor's drug and alcohol fund um so
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge with that is this
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
is something that's still federally
 
05:42:32.110 --> 05:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
prohibited and it's just a matter of
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out when you mingle
 
05:42:36.390 --> 05:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
those funds or not um it may make sense
 
05:42:38.670 --> 05:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
for the 65 % that goes to the education
 
05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund to go in perhaps the the day
 
05:42:44.110 --> 05:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
the day before it happens or figure out
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
some way so that it can off set those
 
05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
local property taxes so it's not
 
05:42:49.548 --> 05:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
co-mingling there but the intention is
 
05:42:51.868 --> 05:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
to directly offset local property taxes
 
05:42:55.070 --> 05:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
with the 65% going to education um
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
similar and if there's any clarification
 
05:42:59.070 --> 05:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
you can help me have there to make sure
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not comingling funds there
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
also would be important but that's why
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's separate because if we end up with
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
any issues with co-mingled funds that's
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
why most Most states when they've
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
implemented legalization they have that
 
05:43:12.670 --> 05:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
five Commissioners in the Massachusetts
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis and they're not really
 
05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
reporting to anybody that's because they
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
were trying to insulate it enough from
 
05:43:19.548 --> 05:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
the state so that the federal government
 
05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come after the state itself at
 
05:43:23.708 --> 05:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
this point we're maturing but we still
 
05:43:25.230 --> 05:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
want to be careful with that I mean if
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
you look at how if you have an improper
 
05:43:30.590 --> 05:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
trade in your 401k fund when you're 30
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
they can still come after you when
 
05:43:33.788 --> 05:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
you're 70 for anything that they deem to
 
05:43:35.788 --> 05:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
be profits off of those improperly
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
mingled funds and it basically poisons
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
most of that account if you had violated
 
05:43:44.110 --> 05:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
one of the rules early on and so that's
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
why having a separate fund keeps it
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
safer considering that it's still
 
05:43:47.360 --> 05:43:48.628 align:start position:0%
safer considering that it's still
federally

05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
federally
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
prohibited so um I asked the state
 
05:43:53.468 --> 05:43:53.478 align:start position:0%
treasurer to be here today because of
 
05:43:55.110 --> 05:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
the whole co- mangling and if you're
 
05:43:57.788 --> 05:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
going to take money raised from Cannabis
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
and you're going to give it to the
 
05:44:02.590 --> 05:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
education fund or these other agencies
 
05:44:04.350 --> 05:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
and then somebody at some point comes
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
back and says uh you can't do this and I
 
05:44:09.468 --> 05:44:09.478 align:start position:0%
know that there's a cannabis fund that
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
will be set aside separate that will be
 
05:44:14.430 --> 05:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
overseen by the state treasury so I'd be
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
just curious at some point today we'll
 
05:44:18.750 --> 05:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
call Monica up here from the the state
 
05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
treasurer to speak to that issue because
 
05:44:22.590 --> 05:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
that is a big concern if you're giving
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
all this money out and then somebody
 
05:44:27.390 --> 05:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
like you say says there's a problem with
 
05:44:30.270 --> 05:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
giving this money to other sources so
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
obviously something be a lot easier if
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
the federal government would just
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis but they haven't yet
 
05:44:39.548 --> 05:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
second um I don't think I have anything
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
else unless uh representative evil yes
 
05:44:45.750 --> 05:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um could you talk a
 
05:44:48.030 --> 05:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about how this interfaces
 
05:44:50.468 --> 05:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
with the atc's and the people that are
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually using the atc's now for medical
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana um will they well first of all
 
05:45:00.070 --> 05:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's the issue of whether an ATC will
 
05:45:02.230 --> 05:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
get any sort of preference but
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
secondarily will the folks that need Med
 
05:45:06.990 --> 05:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana then be in a position
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
position where they have to go to these
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
newly licensed facilities well thank you
 
05:45:14.310 --> 05:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
for the question that's actually a big
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
part of why in the amendment I address
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
some of the ATC concerns um initially we
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
looked about having a dual use
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
certification but that made multiple
 
05:45:26.430 --> 05:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
people uncomfortable um about having an
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
entity that would be underneath both The
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and the Department of
 
05:45:31.990 --> 05:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services we have rule
 
05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
making Authority within the law for um
 
05:45:36.990 --> 05:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a requirement for the liquor
 
05:45:39.548 --> 05:45:39.558 align:start position:0%
commission and DHHS to come to us with a
 
05:45:41.708 --> 05:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
proposal for how they will blend those
 
05:45:43.628 --> 05:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
two programs while making sure to
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
prioritize the maintenance of access um
 
05:45:50.430 --> 05:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
the atc's there this sets out a whole
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
process by which they will in a in a
 
05:45:56.110 --> 05:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
clear way set the requirements and the
 
05:45:58.350 --> 05:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
metrics to assess a good applicant for
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
one of the Cannabis retail outlets one
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
of those metrics will need to be
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
something that reflects the experience
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
of running a successful cannabis vent
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
Venture in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
which only benefits the atcs because
 
05:46:14.110 --> 05:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
they have been doing this we can't just
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
the first thought was to just
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
automatically give each of the three
 
05:46:18.868 --> 05:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
atcs one of the licenses but then you
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
get into other challenges why them why
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't somebody else get one of the
 
05:46:26.350 --> 05:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
licenses and while they are the ones who
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
have been providing this access to
 
05:46:29.788 --> 05:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
patients who need it especially those
 
05:46:32.468 --> 05:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain and other issues um
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's we also need to make sure we strike
 
05:46:36.990 --> 05:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
a balance um the amendment that I have
 
05:46:39.110 --> 05:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
for you include some language just to
 
05:46:40.468 --> 05:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
make sure that they'll be able to grow
 
05:46:43.390 --> 05:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
both the therapeutic and adult use um at
 
05:46:45.628 --> 05:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
the same site subject to appropriate Ru
 
05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
making and just to make sure that
 
05:46:49.628 --> 05:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
they're not having to run two separate
 
05:46:52.310 --> 05:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
businesses because ideally the adult use
 
05:46:54.270 --> 05:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
will help subsidize the cost of the
 
05:46:57.910 --> 05:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis um this is one of
 
05:46:59.628 --> 05:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
those very important issues because we
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that there's still
 
05:47:03.270 --> 05:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
that access this also would allow any of
 
05:47:05.230 --> 05:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
the retail outlets to sell therapeutic
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis and that therap utic cannabis
 
05:47:10.510 --> 05:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
in in my mind would be coming from the
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
atc's growing it because they have the
 
05:47:15.270 --> 05:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
experience and knowing which strains
 
05:47:17.070 --> 05:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
have been shown to be more beneficial in
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
different uses and to make sure that
 
05:47:21.190 --> 05:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
that experience is leveraged and by
 
05:47:22.948 --> 05:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
being able to have a market to sell it
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the other stores that's helps but
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
just being able to sell it in somebody
 
05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
else's store isn't enough to be able to
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
make it so that they can be a more
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
robust operation and make it so those
 
05:47:35.590 --> 05:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
prices can come down
 
05:47:38.270 --> 05:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
because I I I haven't pulled any
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
patients lately but I have uh plenty of
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
people that in the past have talked
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
about the cost of it and I know that the
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
more that we have give them an
 
05:47:48.430 --> 05:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make money in a more more
 
05:47:50.350 --> 05:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
in a more Market driven situation as
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to a more therapeutic situation
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
it should be able to bring the
 
05:47:56.830 --> 05:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.840 --> 05:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
down

05:48:03.190 --> 05:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic I can't wait to see what
 
05:48:20.350 --> 05:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:22.708 --> 05:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.040 --> 05:48:35.708 align:start position:0%
 
mipel

05:48:35.708 --> 05:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.990 --> 05:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
the so I saw that um back in November
 
05:48:53.708 --> 05:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
that you testified before the commission
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
and you express some of those concerns
 
05:48:57.468 --> 05:48:57.478 align:start position:0%
that we all know about and one in
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
particular that state would effectively
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
be engaged in a state sanction money
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
laundering due to the Canabis being
 
05:49:07.948 --> 05:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
illegal and and then of course the
 
05:49:10.110 --> 05:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty Banks whether the state
 
05:49:11.948 --> 05:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
existing banks that the state uses would
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
be willing to accept money from Cannabis
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
sales could you expand on that or sure
 
05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that comment um I'm
 
05:49:24.350 --> 05:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
just going to clarify that during my
 
05:49:27.430 --> 05:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that I think I think that um
 
05:49:29.788 --> 05:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
that statement that became part of the
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
report it was part of a conversation so
 
05:49:33.948 --> 05:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
I think it was just described in the
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
report that he came from my testimony
 
05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
but I think was again a conversation at
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
that time um but it's but it it's true
 
05:49:44.310 --> 05:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of um the concerns that I I
 
05:49:46.270 --> 05:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the commission at the time
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
were uh what we've been here in you know
 
05:49:51.510 --> 05:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
all over the country uh there are um
 
05:49:54.990 --> 05:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
some banks who are U banks are concerned
 
05:49:57.990 --> 05:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
about the r that they will um take uh
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
due to the banking loss and some of the
 
05:50:02.590 --> 05:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
federal laws that they have to comply
 
05:50:06.910 --> 05:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
with um the other um again the we we
 
05:50:09.468 --> 05:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
hear and and this is just based on uh
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
limited information that I've received
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are some banks that are willing to
 
05:50:16.468 --> 05:50:16.478 align:start position:0%
bank with um and do business with the
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
Cannabis business um I was um able to
 
05:50:22.510 --> 05:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
speak to at least two of the banks that
 
05:50:24.910 --> 05:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
we do business with and um I had two
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
different responses one um One bank said
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
yes we we could do we could we could
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
bank with you um if if you end up with a
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill that has cannabis the other bank
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
said absolutely not we can we can't do
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
that so we'll so we'll find that um I
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
think you know it'll be interesting to
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
to and and as I mentioned in my previous
 
05:50:48.030 --> 05:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we do business with many banks
 
05:50:51.150 --> 05:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
um with most chter um State chared Banks
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and then we also bank with three
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
Banks primarily because of their large
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
footprint we're able to um we conduct
 
05:51:01.230 --> 05:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
most of our business with those uh three
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
large um Banks uh in the state and and
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
and again it will be uh we will have to
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
really um find out uh if this this bill
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
passes of some sort of this bill um or
 
05:51:18.670 --> 05:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
again some some um a canab uh bill
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
passes we will have to learn and and try
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
to find out how um you know if we can
 
05:51:26.270 --> 05:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
conduct business the same way with those
 
05:51:29.948 --> 05:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
Banks um if not at least we at least we
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
know that there is one Bank willing to
 
05:51:35.310 --> 05:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
to uh bank with us so we will have to
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
work with that particular Bank
 
05:51:39.788 --> 05:51:39.798 align:start position:0%
uh to to receive the
 
05:51:44.270 --> 05:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
collections um the other um something
 
05:51:46.110 --> 05:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
that after after I was doing some
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
research and we were able to contact the
 
05:51:52.230 --> 05:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
State of Maine so um I know um we
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
haven't receive detail information from
 
05:51:58.590 --> 05:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
Main but this um uh um Main's Treasures
 
05:52:00.190 --> 05:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
Office is willing to work with us and
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
try to to we we could learn from them
 
05:52:04.750 --> 05:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
and and learn their model how they're
 
05:52:07.830 --> 05:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
how they were able to implement um their
 
05:52:10.990 --> 05:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
law and also how they conduct their
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
business so at least we will be able to
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
learn from um again I've I've been in
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
touch with Maine but we likely will be
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
able to learn how all the states U are
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
able to conduct business with the uh
 
05:52:22.878 --> 05:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
able to conduct business with the uh
Federal

05:52:24.150 --> 05:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
challenges yeah main is interesting it's
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
under the department of administrative
 
05:52:30.750 --> 05:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
Services up there is a bureau cannabis
 
05:52:32.110 --> 05:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
which thought that was kind of an
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
interesting model but are there any
 
05:52:36.150 --> 05:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
questions for the state treasurer yes
 
05:52:36.160 --> 05:52:37.070 align:start position:0%
questions for the state treasurer yes
repr

05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
repr
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
Madame Treasurer um does the Liquor
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
Commission currently for their alcohol
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
business have their own bank and their
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
own bank accounts and so on or is
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
everything through
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
you we do have separate banks for the
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but it's not
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh it's just clearly for
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
convenience at this time uh once we
 
05:53:01.350 --> 05:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
collect those funds everything gets
 
05:53:04.150 --> 05:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
pulled we we call pull cash all of the
 
05:53:06.030 --> 05:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
collections on the state taxes fees
 
05:53:08.310 --> 05:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
everything that'ss in One bank account
 
05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh to be able to earn
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
interest so that's that's how we
 
05:53:15.990 --> 05:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
typically conduct our business even
 
05:53:18.190 --> 05:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
though we use separate bank accounts for
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
this particular case I think we could
 
05:53:22.830 --> 05:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
accommodate One bank account for this
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
one fund but when it gets complicated is
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
really um and as I was listening to the
 
05:53:30.868 --> 05:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
testimony I started thinking about how
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
we would be able to separate
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
funds um can AB
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
funds we could do as much as we can
 
05:53:42.510 --> 05:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
again having a separate bank account but
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
when it's time to transfer funds to the
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
other agencies that's when it will
 
05:53:50.430 --> 05:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
become really tricky um everything will
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
probably this fund the Cannabis fund
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
will live in the accounting system as
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know as part of the state accounting
 
05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
system I don't see any resources that
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
speaks about uh having a separate Ledger
 
05:54:03.830 --> 05:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
or separate accounting system that will
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
track this so we will have to become
 
05:54:07.708 --> 05:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
part of what you know what we use for
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
the state's business and and and again
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
when we so doing that we again commingle
 
05:54:15.030 --> 05:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the funds so we may be able to collect
 
05:54:16.990 --> 05:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
them in One bank account but then we
 
05:54:19.948 --> 05:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
need to start Distributing it to the uh
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
ultimate recipients of this funds so I
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if that will create
 
05:54:26.708 --> 05:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
additional challenges as I was listening
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
as I was here if I may follow up so when
 
05:54:31.948 --> 05:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission currently pays
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
their suppliers the dis the distillers
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't know Johnny Walker
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
or somebody do do you write the check do
 
05:54:42.750 --> 05:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
they on their own bank account or does
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
it come from from your we do it I mean
 
05:54:48.310 --> 05:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
it technically is is just the way
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
mechanically Works uh even though we
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
collect the Liquor Commission funds in
 
05:54:55.230 --> 05:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
One bank account ends up again in our
 
05:54:58.750 --> 05:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
other accounts that we use for um for
 
05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
our vendor payments so it's One bank
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
account again we just collect the money
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then we utilize other bank accounts
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the payments the same with
 
05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
payroll we have one bank account for
 
05:55:11.708 --> 05:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
payroll uh another one for vendors and
 
05:55:15.310 --> 05:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
business where are
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
questions as a followup to
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's question I know
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
that the law specifically states that
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
liquor is supposed to make daily
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
deposits and that hasn't been done for a
 
05:55:31.390 --> 05:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
period of time is that improved at all
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
or I believe they do uh they I believe
 
05:55:35.430 --> 05:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
they do that it's just because most of
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
the businesses with um credit cards and
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
now they use um saves that automatically
 
05:55:43.270 --> 05:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
deposits those funds into our bank
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
accounts so I believe that's um happens
 
05:55:50.350 --> 05:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
you well seeing no further questions
 
05:55:55.868 --> 05:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
thanks Monica thanks very
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
much so we have
 
05:56:04.990 --> 05:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
um where's banking G uh Wells Todd Wells
 
05:56:12.350 --> 05:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.548 --> 05:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
Todd good afternoon Mr chairman and good

further comments or uh I would uh so I
 
05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
think my best response to that would be
 
05:56:37.468 --> 05:56:37.478 align:start position:0%
to say uh I was the banking Department's
 
05:56:39.548 --> 05:56:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh designated represent uh
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative or or serving on the
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission uh to study the legalization
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
regulation and taxation of marijuana
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
back uh we issued a final report in
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
2018 in preparation for uh my attendance
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
here today I did review that I would
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
tell you from the perspective of the
 
05:56:57.670 --> 05:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
federal guidance that is out there
 
05:57:00.190 --> 05:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
really nothing has changed there was a
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
the report that we issued under that
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
commission back in
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
2018 referenced uh some guidance from
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
what's known as the financial crimes
 
05:57:10.430 --> 05:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement network uh that remains in
 
05:57:13.948 --> 05:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
place uh I would also uh let you know
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
that as a department the New Hampshire
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
banking department has not issued any
 
05:57:19.788 --> 05:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
kind of a position statement in this
 
05:57:22.390 --> 05:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
matter nor have we issued any particular
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
guidance all right thought you looked
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
familiar uh we've had a number of these
 
05:57:30.750 --> 05:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis Commissions in the past and uh
 
05:57:33.070 --> 05:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
seems we always end up in the same spot
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway thanks Todd are there any
 
05:57:35.120 --> 05:57:38.190 align:start position:0%
but anyway thanks Todd are there any
questions

05:57:38.190 --> 05:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:45.548 --> 05:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
coming is I have a card here for the
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Liquor Commission if
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.120 --> 05:58:21.788 align:start position:0%
 
somewhere

05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the committee Joseph Mala chairman of
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and Tina deir our
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
CFO uh We've handed some things out uh
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
some updated
 
05:58:36.628 --> 05:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
information through the LBA and
 
05:58:38.430 --> 05:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
05:58:43.150 --> 05:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:45.310 --> 05:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation so we've received as you
 
05:58:47.468 --> 05:58:47.478 align:start position:0%
already know some changes to the bill
 
05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
that came through Commerce which we
 
05:58:51.708 --> 05:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to really get into
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
I guess the LBA and Os will be getting a
 
05:58:57.948 --> 05:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
draft of those changes to us and we also
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
have a an amendment that's just been
 
05:59:02.990 --> 05:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
given to us from the Senate side of
 
05:59:04.990 --> 05:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
things which we haven't looked at either
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
but I appre appreciate you being here
 
05:59:09.390 --> 05:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
and you've probably heard some of the
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and again we really just have
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
05:59:18.788 --> 05:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
the the most recent um update as your
 
05:59:21.070 --> 05:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
the financial impact and looking back at
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the financial notes from the original
 
05:59:25.750 --> 05:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill as it was
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
amended so I see that there was some
 
05:59:30.990 --> 05:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement uh with the Liquor
 
05:59:32.430 --> 05:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
Commission some of the costs that you
 
05:59:34.468 --> 05:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
felt that probably be greater than what
 
05:59:36.430 --> 05:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
was set aside in the amendment I think
 
05:59:40.030 --> 05:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment called for $2 million for
 
05:59:43.270 --> 05:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
some of the startup there was an $8
 
05:59:45.868 --> 05:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
million request in there to get this up
 
05:59:49.590 --> 05:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
and running um I think I counted about
 
05:59:53.070 --> 05:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
29 new positions again I don't know what
 
05:59:56.070 --> 05:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
these new amendments call for but I
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
guess the big question of the day are
 
06:00:00.868 --> 06:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
you looking to do this is this something
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission wants to do
 
06:00:07.628 --> 06:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
or has an interest in
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
well that's a difficult question I
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
suppose but I mean we're we're business
 
06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
people Mr chairman that's that's what we
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
do so I mean this is we are quite
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
frankly the state of New Hampshire is
 
06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
bleeding money to the states around us
 
06:00:23.430 --> 06:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh it's not something that we're
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing as business people
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we you know we
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
we s certainly try to take advantage of
 
06:00:32.190 --> 06:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
as the Liquor Commission but I mean in
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
the first 10 months of business uh the
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont had $67 million in
 
06:00:40.468 --> 06:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh Massachusetts will do $2
 
06:00:42.430 --> 06:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
billion this year and Maine will
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
probably do 500 million and uh I've been
 
06:00:49.270 --> 06:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
to those States and visited a lot of
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
those stores and I would say 40 to 50%
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the cars in those parking lots are
 
06:00:57.468 --> 06:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire so uh we
 
06:01:01.390 --> 06:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
feel uh a conservative estimate would be
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
our first full year in business we could
 
06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
probably take back 10 to 15% of that
 
06:01:08.430 --> 06:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
business and put it into back into our
 
06:01:10.468 --> 06:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
state coffers rather than the
 
06:01:12.910 --> 06:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding states so is there an
 
06:01:14.510 --> 06:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
interest on the part of the Liquor
 
06:01:17.948 --> 06:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
Commission to do that yes sir there is I
 
06:01:19.868 --> 06:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
do have further questions but I'll open
 
06:01:21.430 --> 06:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
it up to my colleagues for US
 
06:01:24.350 --> 06:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
Representative Maguire um thank you Mr
 
06:01:26.750 --> 06:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr commissioner
 
06:01:29.230 --> 06:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
um looking at the first year the big
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
number here you have roughly 9 million
 
06:01:34.350 --> 06:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
in expenses there's a $5 million item
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
for says standal government traceability
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
solution licensing and auditing and Erp
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
Financial system can you explain that
 
06:01:44.670 --> 06:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
and why is it so
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
expensive well we're just going through
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
the system now the Erp system for uh The
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission which is a 39y old
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
system which uh hasn't been upgraded in
 
06:01:59.708 --> 06:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
in that many years and I I'm not sure
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
where we're actually at but I'm say I
 
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
would guess that we're somewhere in the
 
06:02:07.230 --> 06:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
$30 million range um to run the Liquor
 
06:02:09.548 --> 06:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
Commission business so this is this in
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
fact was an estimate to run that type of
 
06:02:16.830 --> 06:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
system separate from the liquor entity
 
06:02:19.150 --> 06:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to co-mingle the
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
funds or blend the funds in case there
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
was ever an issue with uh the federal
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
government we wanted to make sure that
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
we could clearly identify in an audit
 
06:02:32.590 --> 06:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
what was liquor funds transferred and
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
what were uh cannabis funds transferred
 
06:02:35.600 --> 06:02:36.350 align:start position:0%
what were uh cannabis funds transferred
and

06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:39.230 --> 06:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I feel it's a probably a
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
million yes thank you um apparently in
 
06:02:50.190 --> 06:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
the past there was a bill that passed
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
the house to um actually uh not have the
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
liquor um commission sell marijuana at
 
06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
at themselves directly right and so
 
06:03:06.350 --> 06:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
would some of these costs um line if
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
such a bill became long no uh the the
 
06:03:11.548 --> 06:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
costs that you have in front of you now
 
06:03:15.150 --> 06:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
are our estimates on a separate model
 
06:03:17.708 --> 06:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
the main thing with selling it in our
 
06:03:20.990 --> 06:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
stores so to speak is there's a certain
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
clientele that comes into uh the liquor
 
06:03:27.150 --> 06:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
stores and we certainly it's we've
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
created a family business I was in one
 
06:03:31.590 --> 06:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the stores yesterday there was a
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
gentle a husband and wife shopping with
 
06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
their children that's no place for
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis to be sold and quite frankly I
 
06:03:42.190 --> 06:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would I think it
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
would turn off some of the consumers
 
06:03:46.510 --> 06:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
that shop in The Liquor Commission
 
06:03:48.990 --> 06:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
stores to have that co-mingling of
 
06:03:51.150 --> 06:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
stores so the idea was to go with a
 
06:03:54.150 --> 06:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
separate a separate model a franchise
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
model and this is what I had originally
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
proposed uh in the Commerce Committee
 
06:04:02.750 --> 06:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
when we did it so it would know the cost
 
06:04:05.548 --> 06:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
that you see there would not diminish so
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm very surprised to hear you say
 
06:04:09.548 --> 06:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
that because to me alcohol is not
 
06:04:11.708 --> 06:04:11.718 align:start position:0%
something for children either right well
 
06:04:13.868 --> 06:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not saying that something is
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that alcohol is for children at all that
 
06:04:17.948 --> 06:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't the statement and that wasn't my
 
06:04:20.830 --> 06:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
mindset my mindset was that we've
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
created stores on the highways we're
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
putting out the RFP for the Hamptons uh
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming week people stop they
 
06:04:32.468 --> 06:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
buy their children lunch they they take
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of our our roadside stores and
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
then they go into the liquor store with
 
06:04:39.548 --> 06:04:39.558 align:start position:0%
their children I I just wouldn't think
 
06:04:43.628 --> 06:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
that the state would want that exposure
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh of families in a a 21y old uh or an
 
06:04:49.320 --> 06:04:52.230 align:start position:0%
uh of families in a a 21y old uh or an
adult

06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
adult
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
consumable reference with with cannabis
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
we just didn't think that it would would
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
blend we the thing with the Cannabis
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
Market is is unique in that there's a
 
06:05:07.150 --> 06:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
certain generation of people that are
 
06:05:10.430 --> 06:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
very in tune to it and very much buying
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
the product we saw that during the D the
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
D the past dry January so the the
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales
 
06:05:21.190 --> 06:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
Nationwide declined 45% but the Cannabis
 
06:05:24.990 --> 06:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
sales Nationwide increased 75% just
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
during the month of January during the J
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
January and the and the folks that are
 
06:05:32.750 --> 06:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
gen Z's and gen xers are drinking less
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
but they're using they're using cannabis
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
products so so that's our our our
 
06:05:40.910 --> 06:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
feeling and our mindset was we have an
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
established business with the New
 
06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire liquor and wine outwits and we
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to uh wouldn't want to
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
turn off any of our of our consumers
 
06:05:52.788 --> 06:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
that come here and have shop with us for
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
many many years we're 90 years in
 
06:05:57.310 --> 06:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
business this year so we're established
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
and pretty proud of that thank
 
06:06:03.548 --> 06:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
you sh represent Sweeney thank you Mr
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you chairman for being
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
here so just want to clarify by of the
 
06:06:10.310 --> 06:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
models presented franchise is is what
 
06:06:12.430 --> 06:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
what do you support we support the
 
06:06:14.868 --> 06:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
franchise model that we feel that it's
 
06:06:17.190 --> 06:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
the best way for the state to go about
 
06:06:21.350 --> 06:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
about being in business it is uh in in
 
06:06:24.190 --> 06:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
our mind I I I don't particularly love
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
the cliche but it is kind of a public
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
private partnership where the Liquor
 
06:06:31.390 --> 06:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
Commission would oversee the model but
 
06:06:34.628 --> 06:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
it would there the benefit to the people
 
06:06:37.468 --> 06:06:37.478 align:start position:0%
that had the license is and to the jobs
 
06:06:40.590 --> 06:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
that it would create Vermont created 700
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
jobs in the first 10 months when they
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
opened so our model would be at least
 
06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:56.468 --> 06:06:56.478 align:start position:0%
you further questions I do have another
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
one so in the original amendment that we
 
06:07:01.510 --> 06:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
have before us uh in the fiscal note it
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
stated that the upper management of the
 
06:07:06.190 --> 06:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission should res receive at
 
06:07:09.150 --> 06:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
least a 10% stipend or increase is that
 
06:07:11.788 --> 06:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
in your new fiscal note or yes that was
 
06:07:14.548 --> 06:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
in the note and and the the stien was
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
for anyone I believe that we we put in
 
06:07:19.390 --> 06:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
the original language and we had just
 
06:07:22.670 --> 06:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
passed out if I can find it quickly and
 
06:07:24.590 --> 06:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
read it but it's not just for upper
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
management it's for anybody that's going
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be involved with doing two jobs
 
06:07:36.030 --> 06:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to be asked to work on uh
 
06:07:38.190 --> 06:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
the liquor the liquor model your normal
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
job and then you're going to be asked to
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
develop a brand new model the Cannabis
 
06:07:46.230 --> 06:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
model so we felt that it was fair to
 
06:07:49.150 --> 06:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
motivate folks to do that by giving them
 
06:07:52.110 --> 06:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
a 10% stien and it would be anyone
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
involved with it across the board at The
 
06:07:54.120 --> 06:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
involved with it across the board at The
Liquor

06:07:55.990 --> 06:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor
 
06:07:58.030 --> 06:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
Commission and do you have an estimate
 
06:08:01.430 --> 06:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
of that cost somewhere we
 
06:08:04.430 --> 06:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
do we estimated at about 200,000 in the
 
06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of and as you know
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
that we've spoken to this many many
 
06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
times there's not a lot of full-time
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
positions at The Liquor Commission to
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
begin with there's only about 400
 
06:08:21.910 --> 06:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
full-timers that includes our
 
06:08:24.990 --> 06:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement our headquarters and our
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
stores so this is just a what I would
 
06:08:33.788 --> 06:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
consider a thank you for being able to
 
06:08:36.030 --> 06:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
to do two jobs and develop velop a new
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
business that would benefit the state
 
06:08:42.430 --> 06:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
the 10% stien would would be just
 
06:08:46.030 --> 06:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
that so you raised a good point about um
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
bringing more money in supporting the
 
06:08:51.708 --> 06:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
state uh as you know in Massachusetts
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
they just have a separate cannabis
 
06:08:55.948 --> 06:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
commission and they have five
 
06:08:59.510 --> 06:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with this new role is it
 
06:09:01.390 --> 06:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate to just have one I don't
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
like you know put you on the spot but U
 
06:09:06.150 --> 06:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
to be quite candidate seems at least to
 
06:09:08.030 --> 06:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
me that we should have at least more
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
than one commissioner if there's such a
 
06:09:14.190 --> 06:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
large agency handling um both cannabis
 
06:09:14.200 --> 06:09:16.510 align:start position:0%
large agency handling um both cannabis
and

06:09:16.510 --> 06:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:18.750 --> 06:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
liquor I don't feel that that would be
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
necessary I think that the the business
 
06:09:23.230 --> 06:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we have in place there used to be
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners at The Liquor
 
06:09:27.628 --> 06:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
Commission and one was the chairman uh
 
06:09:29.708 --> 06:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
about six years ago they made it a
 
06:09:32.390 --> 06:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and a Deputy Commissioner uh I
 
06:09:34.708 --> 06:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
don't feel that in order to run this
 
06:09:36.750 --> 06:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
business because we're not actually
 
06:09:39.468 --> 06:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
we're not we're running the back side of
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
the business the we're running the the
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
advertising piece we're running the uh
 
06:09:47.788 --> 06:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
licensing piece so all those folks are
 
06:09:50.350 --> 06:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
considered in what we've asked as far as
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
the upper management there's no the the
 
06:09:57.270 --> 06:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
business piece of it is all being run by
 
06:09:59.070 --> 06:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
the additional folks that we've asked
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
for so no I don't feel that there's a
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
necessary a need for another
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
whatever you choose to call that now in
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
your um again the earlier Amendment and
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you heard my question uh
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
it gives a Liquor Commission complete
 
06:10:20.430 --> 06:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
authority to go into a community with or
 
06:10:22.350 --> 06:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
without notifying either the local
 
06:10:25.468 --> 06:10:25.478 align:start position:0%
police the state police or the county is
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
that something you're comfortable with
 
06:10:29.390 --> 06:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
or because I'm not I think that if
 
06:10:30.750 --> 06:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's something going on that the
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission should certainly
 
06:10:35.310 --> 06:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
notify the local police of some kind
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
kind of activity and does not go into
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
any Community unannounced well the chief
 
06:10:41.910 --> 06:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
is here but it's my understanding
 
06:10:43.948 --> 06:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
whenever we go into a community that
 
06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
Community knows that we're there from a
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
what the amend say from a liquor
 
06:10:50.670 --> 06:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint well I I wouldn't agree that
 
06:10:52.590 --> 06:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
we would ever have the authority to go
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere into a pro into a community and
 
06:10:57.628 --> 06:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
not let people know they were we're
 
06:11:01.110 --> 06:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
there and just one more I noticed that
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's no fiscal oversight for
 
06:11:04.240 --> 06:11:05.788 align:start position:0%
uh there's no fiscal oversight for
transfers

06:11:05.788 --> 06:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
06:11:08.110 --> 06:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
so is that something uh as you know that
 
06:11:10.670 --> 06:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement for transfers over
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
$75,000 to come to fiscal that is not in
 
06:11:16.350 --> 06:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment so you're allowed to make
 
06:11:18.990 --> 06:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
any transfers without fiscal
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
oversight well I think in running any
 
06:11:23.230 --> 06:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
business we've uh you know we went from
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
having the ability to run to move 5% of
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
our total budget and and I certainly
 
06:11:34.030 --> 06:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
think that in starting a business we
 
06:11:35.708 --> 06:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
should be able to have that
 
06:11:37.670 --> 06:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
transferability if the legislature
 
06:11:41.150 --> 06:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
chooses to confine it at some point or
 
06:11:43.948 --> 06:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
restrict it at some point that would be
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
the legislator's decis legislative
 
06:11:48.110 --> 06:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
decision but I think when we're starting
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
the business we should have the ability
 
06:11:52.510 --> 06:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
to transfer the funds to move it and
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
build the business the way we see that
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
it needs to be as it grows I guess I
 
06:11:58.948 --> 06:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
would disagree I think starting a
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
business you would more likely want that
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
authority to take a look and there's my
 
06:12:06.990 --> 06:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
colleague on fiscal Jess Edwards says
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
the more eyes the more transparency so
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
well I I I certainly understand uh your
 
06:12:17.110 --> 06:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint but the flexibility of of
 
06:12:18.750 --> 06:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
running a business and opening a
 
06:12:21.150 --> 06:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
business is what we need and I know that
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
the time frames and the time constraints
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
are a big piece of what we're doing here
 
06:12:28.110 --> 06:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
the states around us have a big lead and
 
06:12:29.548 --> 06:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to catch up and
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to catch up quickly
 
06:12:35.190 --> 06:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
with rules regulations licensing we have
 
06:12:37.030 --> 06:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
to allow enough time for the people that
 
06:12:38.948 --> 06:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
come in to get the licenses to build
 
06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
their buildings put up their green
 
06:12:43.628 --> 06:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
houses do their retail stores we have to
 
06:12:46.150 --> 06:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
have a certain look and feel much like
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have with the Liquor Commission
 
06:12:49.750 --> 06:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
stores so I think that's that
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
flexibility is necessary in order to be
 
06:12:55.390 --> 06:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
nimble while we're building the business
 
06:12:57.670 --> 06:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
now you mentioned rules I noticed that
 
06:12:59.948 --> 06:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
the the possible rules delay could be
 
06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
upwards of 20 months you know how
 
06:13:04.390 --> 06:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
difficult it is to get through the rules
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
process so when would you guess that the
 
06:13:08.830 --> 06:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
first day that the state would receive
 
06:13:11.390 --> 06:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
any sort of return and not have to take
 
06:13:13.070 --> 06:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
money out of the general fund to keep
 
06:13:15.390 --> 06:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
this thing going well we just did we
 
06:13:17.628 --> 06:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
just have redone 11 rule sets at The
 
06:13:19.270 --> 06:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission in the last three
 
06:13:21.910 --> 06:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
years so I certainly understand doing
 
06:13:25.390 --> 06:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
that as far as I I think it let's let's
 
06:13:28.750 --> 06:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
find out what the actual bill looks like
 
06:13:30.350 --> 06:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
and what we're going to pass and then
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to answer that
 
06:13:35.670 --> 06:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate that yeah because
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of things in front of us
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
that we haven't seen until today so it
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
kind of sets us back a little bit and
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for that represent Maguire
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
thank so um in the franchise model
 
06:13:48.990 --> 06:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment it gives you control over
 
06:13:52.670 --> 06:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
prices of products is it is it the case
 
06:13:54.670 --> 06:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
that every store would have exactly the
 
06:13:56.548 --> 06:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
same product and the exactly the same
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
price and so on and and any kind of
 
06:14:01.390 --> 06:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
promotions would be common among all the
 
06:14:04.110 --> 06:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
stores uh there would be our feeling
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
would be that there be certain over I
 
06:14:08.190 --> 06:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
think the word that we wanted to use was
 
06:14:10.510 --> 06:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of pricing we wanted to make
 
06:14:13.070 --> 06:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we had the ability to look and
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
see what the franchises were carrying
 
06:14:18.390 --> 06:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we were price
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
competitive hopefully beating the states
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
around us when it comes to those
 
06:14:25.948 --> 06:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
particular products so we wanted to have
 
06:14:28.830 --> 06:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
oversight of those products regardless
 
06:14:31.270 --> 06:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
of what they were when they're cannabis
 
06:14:33.868 --> 06:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
related as far as other other items that
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
the stores would carry not on cannabis
 
06:14:38.510 --> 06:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know Swag t-shirts merchandise
 
06:14:40.670 --> 06:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it would be that's up to the
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
the business individually but we
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want uh the stores to be
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
overpricing or price gouging uh our uh
 
06:14:52.510 --> 06:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
consumers and making us uncompetitive
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
and as far as what the stores carried no
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
all we would ask of the franchisees is
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
that they let us know what they're
 
06:15:01.390 --> 06:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
carrying in their stores and if they
 
06:15:03.230 --> 06:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to differentiate from store to
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
store What They Carried or if there was
 
06:15:06.830 --> 06:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
a specific grower that they had a
 
06:15:08.430 --> 06:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
business relationship with that they
 
06:15:10.270 --> 06:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that product in we're
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
fine with that thank
 
06:15:16.150 --> 06:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
you so you may have been out of the room
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
when I asked this question earlier one
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the things I noticed it said that if
 
06:15:22.350 --> 06:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
there was a disciplinary matter brought
 
06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
up before the commission uh the
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner would set whatever
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
suspension or fines or whatever without
 
06:15:31.628 --> 06:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
the possibility of a hearing now as you
 
06:15:33.310 --> 06:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
know like Lottery has hearings if
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
someone's upset by one of their decision
 
06:15:38.830 --> 06:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to having uh a
 
06:15:40.628 --> 06:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
hearing so someone could defend
 
06:15:42.030 --> 06:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
themselves if they found that the
 
06:15:44.030 --> 06:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
commission was wrong or at least
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
alleging that it was wrongdoing on the
 
06:15:48.750 --> 06:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
commission's part no absolutely not just
 
06:15:50.468 --> 06:15:50.478 align:start position:0%
like we do on the liquor side of the
 
06:15:52.910 --> 06:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
house uh people are allowed to come to
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
our weekly meetings and they're allowed
 
06:15:56.830 --> 06:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're all public hearings and they're
 
06:15:59.868 --> 06:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to uh have uh a hearing in front
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the Commission in front of our
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
hearings officer on any dispute that
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
they that they have
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't be against that at all no I
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
think that it would be prudent quite
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
frankly well thank you for your
 
06:16:15.390 --> 06:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh sorry your able
 
06:16:17.430 --> 06:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
assistant wasn't able to speak on
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
anything but more than able assistant
 
06:16:22.628 --> 06:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman thank
 
06:16:25.548 --> 06:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%

chaffy

06:16:44.350 --> 06:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:46.510 --> 06:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the
 
06:16:46.520 --> 06:16:48.030 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the
committee

06:16:48.030 --> 06:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:16:50.830 --> 06:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you thank you and good
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon um and thank you for the
 
06:16:56.468 --> 06:16:56.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment I will be brief
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
um I just want to first start by saying
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
that I have so much respect for all of
 
06:17:04.628 --> 06:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
the work that has gone in to this effort
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
um and I just sort of want to share I
 
06:17:09.270 --> 06:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
think some of the um sentiments that
 
06:17:11.468 --> 06:17:11.478 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney uh indicated
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
earlier which is that we have a very
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity this year with
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
regards to actually making progress on
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
this effort of moving forward with
 
06:17:22.070 --> 06:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis Senator Bradley
 
06:17:23.670 --> 06:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
has recognized that we have the votes in
 
06:17:26.310 --> 06:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate the governor has indicated
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
that with certain um conditions he will
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
sign the bill it's a very you know for
 
06:17:33.310 --> 06:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been working on
 
06:17:35.628 --> 06:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
this issue for many many many many years
 
06:17:38.110 --> 06:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
many of you whom have uh the idea that
 
06:17:39.590 --> 06:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
we could finally move this across the
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
Finish Line I think is very exciting I
 
06:17:45.390 --> 06:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
have a very uh small and discreet issue
 
06:17:47.868 --> 06:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
that I want to bring to the committee um
 
06:17:51.310 --> 06:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
and some unintended p uh potential costs
 
06:17:54.190 --> 06:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
that might be associated with that issue
 
06:17:56.670 --> 06:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
and it has to do with um an issue that
 
06:17:59.628 --> 06:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative Leon referred to earlier
 
06:18:01.670 --> 06:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
um with the increase in penalties for
 
06:18:04.948 --> 06:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
smoking in public um you can find it in
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
the version of HB 1633 that passed the
 
06:18:12.310 --> 06:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
house you can find it on page nine lines
 
06:18:15.190 --> 06:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
um lines 13 through
 
06:18:19.310 --> 06:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
15 where you see that um the uh the
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
penalty for the third offense for
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
smoking in public uh it is uh you should
 
06:18:27.670 --> 06:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
one should be guilty of an undefined
 
06:18:29.670 --> 06:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it just says guilty of a
 
06:18:32.270 --> 06:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's unspecified because it
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify whether it should be a
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Class A or a last b um what this means
 
06:18:40.590 --> 06:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
is that under existing law if you are
 
06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
caught with less than
 
06:18:45.628 --> 06:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
34 uh of an ounce of marijuana on that
 
06:18:48.750 --> 06:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
third offense um the that the highest
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
def the highest penalty that you can
 
06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
receive is a Class B misdemeanor under
 
06:18:56.670 --> 06:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
existing law um what this means is
 
06:18:58.990 --> 06:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
essentially should this pass uh the
 
06:19:01.110 --> 06:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
state will be on the hook for providing
 
06:19:03.430 --> 06:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
potentially providing a public defender
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to represent any individual who is
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
charged with a class a misdem meter um
 
06:19:12.230 --> 06:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
under this um elevated penalty here in
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
addition to any costs of potentially um
 
06:19:17.548 --> 06:19:17.558 align:start position:0%
holding an individual who's convicted of
 
06:19:19.548 --> 06:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
a Class A misdemeanor in jail this is
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
because with a Class A misdemeanor you
 
06:19:24.590 --> 06:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
can actually face jail time whereas a
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor which is still a
 
06:19:30.948 --> 06:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
crime it still has Hefty fines of up to
 
06:19:33.788 --> 06:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
$1,200 so significant penalty still
 
06:19:36.190 --> 06:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
creates a criminal record for the
 
06:19:38.910 --> 06:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
individual um but that wouldn't require
 
06:19:41.070 --> 06:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh the state to pay for public defenders
 
06:19:43.430 --> 06:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
or potentially pay to hold this person
 
06:19:46.390 --> 06:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
who was smoking in public in jail um and
 
06:19:50.708 --> 06:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very easy fix um uh to
 
06:19:52.868 --> 06:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
address these potentially
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
unintended uh costs coming from them all
 
06:19:57.230 --> 06:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
you would have to do is insert the word
 
06:19:59.310 --> 06:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
Class B in front of Miss demeanor on
 
06:20:02.190 --> 06:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
line 15 um and I would just really
 
06:20:04.910 --> 06:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee as you're going
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is an issue that will
 
06:20:08.910 --> 06:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
likely be present in all I don't I
 
06:20:10.350 --> 06:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
haven't seen all of the versions that
 
06:20:12.110 --> 06:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
you've seen but I believe that it is
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
likely a concern that would apply to any
 
06:20:16.310 --> 06:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
version of it that's likely before you
 
06:20:18.510 --> 06:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
and I would ask that you give serious
 
06:20:21.070 --> 06:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
consideration as to whether or not New
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers should be paying for
 
06:20:24.990 --> 06:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
public defenders for somebody who was
 
06:20:26.990 --> 06:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
caught smoking in public or whether or
 
06:20:29.430 --> 06:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
not that should be um specified as a
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
class be
 
06:20:33.628 --> 06:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor thank you so
 
06:20:36.990 --> 06:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
much so that's it nothing else gets your
 
06:20:39.708 --> 06:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
attention that is my primary concern
 
06:20:41.230 --> 06:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
06:20:43.270 --> 06:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative eil so I just want to
 
06:20:45.230 --> 06:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody understands what you
 
06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
said this bill the way it's written
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
makes uh changes the class of
 
06:20:54.468 --> 06:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to a higher class than what
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
it is now correct under the under this
 
06:21:01.788 --> 06:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
existing under this under existing law
 
06:21:03.510 --> 06:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
if you if you're SM if you were smoking
 
06:21:05.548 --> 06:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
in public and had less than 3/4 of an
 
06:21:07.830 --> 06:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
ounce which most people that would it
 
06:21:10.390 --> 06:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be less than 3/4 of an ounce the
 
06:21:13.070 --> 06:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
highest penalty that you can face is a
 
06:21:16.150 --> 06:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor under this law under
 
06:21:18.270 --> 06:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
the the the bill as passed by the house
 
06:21:20.230 --> 06:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
you could potentially face jail time
 
06:21:21.788 --> 06:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
which would be a significant increase in
 
06:21:23.350 --> 06:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
penalty and that would have an
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
Associated cost to the state represent
 
06:21:29.708 --> 06:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:21:32.788 --> 06:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
um there's a similar thing I think for
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
for consuming while operating a mo
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
moving vehicle should that be the
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
same I think the issue with related to
 
06:21:46.110 --> 06:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
consuming while operating a vehicle I
 
06:21:49.548 --> 06:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
think is clearly a that is clearly a a
 
06:21:52.150 --> 06:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
much more significant crime that may
 
06:21:53.910 --> 06:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
warrant more significant penalties
 
06:21:55.390 --> 06:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about potentially putting
 
06:21:57.868 --> 06:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
people in danger if you're consuming a
 
06:21:59.430 --> 06:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
substance that's going to you know alter
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
your state while driving um so I would I
 
06:22:03.868 --> 06:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
would I I think that there's a clear
 
06:22:05.350 --> 06:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
distinction to be be made there I'm not
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
saying that you shouldn't Rec you know
 
06:22:08.548 --> 06:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
consider that there might be similar
 
06:22:10.590 --> 06:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
considerations but from our perspective
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're certainly more concerned with that
 
06:22:14.270 --> 06:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
third offense for simply smoking in
 
06:22:17.310 --> 06:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
public which is in our opinion a much
 
06:22:20.468 --> 06:22:20.478 align:start position:0%
more minor crime just in general I've
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
spoken to police and asked them this
 
06:22:24.990 --> 06:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
question and they say they never have
 
06:22:27.430 --> 06:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
problems with with cannabis it's all
 
06:22:30.590 --> 06:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
with alcohol so you know anyways thank
 
06:22:39.750 --> 06:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:47.670 --> 06:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hannon good afternoon members of the
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Joe Hannon uh I
 
06:22:51.708 --> 06:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
was a former legislator myself in the
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee years ago and after I
 
06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
left um voluntarily I
 
06:23:00.110 --> 06:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
guess depends if the voters ATS say um I
 
06:23:01.628 --> 06:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
I was on the Cannabis study Commission
 
06:23:04.990 --> 06:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
in 2018 uh did extensive uh work on this
 
06:23:06.830 --> 06:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
then I've been a part of the Coalition
 
06:23:07.990 --> 06:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is helping to craft some of the
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation for the last uh year and
 
06:23:12.830 --> 06:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
even before that um I I just wanted to
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
run a couple anecdotal things past you
 
06:23:17.190 --> 06:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
to maybe give some context or Clarity to
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
things that have already been said um
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know as far as uh our familyfriendly
 
06:23:23.070 --> 06:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
liquor stores that are on the side of
 
06:23:24.310 --> 06:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
the highways as you enter the state of
 
06:23:27.468 --> 06:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I'm someone who's in
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
recovery from alcohol and other
 
06:23:31.708 --> 06:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
substances for well over 30 years uh
 
06:23:33.310 --> 06:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol was probably one of the most
 
06:23:34.750 --> 06:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
horrible things that I'd encountered Ed
 
06:23:38.310 --> 06:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
and I had encountered a lot of stuff um
 
06:23:40.150 --> 06:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
I had been to one liquor store when I
 
06:23:41.788 --> 06:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
was here and it was at an opening at the
 
06:23:44.750 --> 06:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
liquor store in eping when I was a um
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative like yourselves and I was
 
06:23:48.910 --> 06:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
a dignitary I saw the chairman give a
 
06:23:50.468 --> 06:23:50.478 align:start position:0%
nice speech about how it's a safe
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
product that it's regulated it's much
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
more um it's a better thing to be
 
06:23:58.990 --> 06:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
regulated um and that was the first time
 
06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
I was in a store the second time was
 
06:24:02.190 --> 06:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
recently when I was in the in the stores
 
06:24:03.628 --> 06:24:03.638 align:start position:0%
looking at the labels because we were in
 
06:24:05.070 --> 06:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
the last Commission was talking about oh
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have to have labels that are safe and
 
06:24:08.590 --> 06:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
kid-friendly and all that and I took
 
06:24:09.990 --> 06:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pictures of the bottles in
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
the liquor store of all the labels that
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'd call them child safe
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm not arguing about that but when
 
06:24:17.510 --> 06:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
I was there interestingly enough I
 
06:24:18.910 --> 06:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
noticed a little child and we heard
 
06:24:20.590 --> 06:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
there were kids in the stores because of
 
06:24:22.468 --> 06:24:22.478 align:start position:0%
f familyfriendly environment there was a
 
06:24:24.468 --> 06:24:24.478 align:start position:0%
little child walking around and I'm
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
thinking oh I didn't know you were
 
06:24:27.350 --> 06:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
allowed in here cuz I've gone to visit
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and other states and every
 
06:24:30.830 --> 06:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
single one I've been in Maine Vermont
 
06:24:32.708 --> 06:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you have should not only
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
give ID at the door they won't let you
 
06:24:35.670 --> 06:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
in if it's not a current valid ID I was
 
06:24:37.190 --> 06:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
behind a lady who was obviously in her
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
late 80s or 90s who had a expired
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
driver's license cuz she hasn't driven
 
06:24:43.548 --> 06:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
since probably the late 80s and they
 
06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let her in meanwhile there's a
 
06:24:47.948 --> 06:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
5-year-old child running around the
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
store hanging on the shopping cart full
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
of booze they get to the cat checkout
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
register and the lady that works at the
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
store one of the employees of the state
 
06:24:59.270 --> 06:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
hands the kid a lollipop so what better
 
06:25:00.990 --> 06:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
incentive than to have a family-friendly
 
06:25:02.310 --> 06:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
environment where we give the kids candy
 
06:25:03.708 --> 06:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
come back to the liquor store kids as
 
06:25:06.628 --> 06:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
I'm walking out out I see now you may if
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
any of you have had kids you notice that
 
06:25:09.788 --> 06:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
they put all the candy at the checkout
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
aisle at eye level for children there
 
06:25:14.750 --> 06:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
are a bucket of candy canes that were
 
06:25:17.548 --> 06:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
Hollow filled with shots of hard liquor
 
06:25:19.708 --> 06:25:19.718 align:start position:0%
right by the door this high off the
 
06:25:21.948 --> 06:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
ground now I didn't notice it at first
 
06:25:23.150 --> 06:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
so I noticed the kid then I started
 
06:25:24.788 --> 06:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
looking around a little more and I
 
06:25:25.788 --> 06:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
noticed that I thought it was a little
 
06:25:28.350 --> 06:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
strange so I I think the familyfriendly
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
thing I think it's a brand that that the
 
06:25:32.708 --> 06:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
state might not want to have interrupted
 
06:25:34.990 --> 06:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
because sales do go down especially
 
06:25:38.270 --> 06:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
amongst younger individuals um who just
 
06:25:40.910 --> 06:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't really drink as much I uh
 
06:25:42.510 --> 06:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
approached uh I'm on the board of ham
 
06:25:44.590 --> 06:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis um New Hampshire
 
06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
um cannabis and we had one of our other
 
06:25:49.548 --> 06:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
board members is a pretty prominent Tik
 
06:25:50.910 --> 06:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
Tock artist and she has hundreds of
 
06:25:52.150 --> 06:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of followers and we went
 
06:25:54.510 --> 06:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
downtown Manchester to ask people
 
06:25:56.110 --> 06:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
questions you know about their use
 
06:25:57.868 --> 06:25:57.878 align:start position:0%
legalization what they felt and we were
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of amazed that most of the young
 
06:26:01.150 --> 06:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
people we talk to don't really claim to
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
drink that much they'd much rather smoke
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
a legal safe
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
product um in Canada and other places
 
06:26:09.270 --> 06:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
they've seen the cost of uh the liquor
 
06:26:10.788 --> 06:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
sales go down especially in those
 
06:26:12.270 --> 06:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
demographics and we heard the chairman
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
also say in dry January that prices
 
06:26:17.628 --> 06:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
sales went down cannabis sales went up
 
06:26:19.150 --> 06:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
there are other things you also see
 
06:26:20.948 --> 06:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
other than alcohol consumption possibly
 
06:26:24.350 --> 06:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
going down um opioid prescriptions have
 
06:26:26.670 --> 06:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
gone down uh significantly in states
 
06:26:28.468 --> 06:26:28.478 align:start position:0%
that have legalized spec First Medical
 
06:26:31.110 --> 06:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then actually recreational uh opioid
 
06:26:32.910 --> 06:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
prescriptions not all prescriptions went
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
down but they looked at coding spefic
 
06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
specifically and Codine is one of the
 
06:26:37.548 --> 06:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
easier narcotic prescriptions to get
 
06:26:38.910 --> 06:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that most people
 
06:26:40.270 --> 06:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
that are in recovery could tell you well
 
06:26:42.030 --> 06:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
it started they gave me Codine or perco
 
06:26:43.948 --> 06:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
setes that was one of the things that
 
06:26:46.390 --> 06:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
went down significantly in the in the
 
06:26:48.510 --> 06:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
years right after legalization uh
 
06:26:50.430 --> 06:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums had gone down
 
06:26:51.990 --> 06:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
significantly uh I can't remember the
 
06:26:53.270 --> 06:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
exact number I can find it for if you'd
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
like but it was well over $5 $1600 for
 
06:26:57.990 --> 06:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the average insurance premium cost that
 
06:27:01.628 --> 06:27:01.638 align:start position:0%
went down um so if we're worried about a
 
06:27:03.310 --> 06:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
few million here and there and we look
 
06:27:04.590 --> 06:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
at the revenue that's coming in from
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
other states it's not even close if we
 
06:27:10.030 --> 06:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
give 6 million 8 million whatever it is
 
06:27:12.030 --> 06:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
if um you know if we give the liquor
 
06:27:13.750 --> 06:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the employees Li
 
06:27:15.548 --> 06:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner sorry there's only one uh
 
06:27:16.708 --> 06:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
if we give the commissioner and the
 
06:27:19.310 --> 06:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
employees a 10% bonus which you know I
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
find funny that it keeps popping up in
 
06:27:22.910 --> 06:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
their versions of the bill and
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
amendments um and also we have this
 
06:27:27.868 --> 06:27:27.878 align:start position:0%
drastic need for no lobbying from the
 
06:27:29.468 --> 06:27:29.478 align:start position:0%
corner office and other people in the
 
06:27:32.708 --> 06:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
Senate and representative for this bill
 
06:27:34.670 --> 06:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
put that in there no lobbying whatsoever
 
06:27:35.788 --> 06:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
so the fact that they need more
 
06:27:37.628 --> 06:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
employees to go over how advertising is
 
06:27:39.270 --> 06:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
done there won't be
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
any they don't need 29 employees for 15
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
stores for that uh it's a licensing
 
06:27:46.230 --> 06:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
apparatus unless they're actually
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
involved in the implementation of the
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
store design and all this other stuff
 
06:27:52.670 --> 06:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
picking out locations you know giving
 
06:27:54.390 --> 06:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
those locations to set in certain
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
individuals you know I don't know how
 
06:27:57.468 --> 06:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
the process works I'm sure it's an open
 
06:28:01.310 --> 06:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
process of RFP stuff but um it's it's a
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
pretty non-transparent thing to have I
 
06:28:05.110 --> 06:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
believe one person person and I'm not
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
saying we have to change that now it's
 
06:28:07.948 --> 06:28:07.958 align:start position:0%
kind of late if the Senate wants to do
 
06:28:13.150 --> 06:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
it I welcome that um you know last thing
 
06:28:15.910 --> 06:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
um what else I think I've said enough
 
06:28:19.310 --> 06:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
damaging things uh but uh if there's any
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions about uh you know what's
 
06:28:22.868 --> 06:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
happened at the last commission the the
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
1918 2000 sorry 2018 commission or
 
06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything in the past year I'd be happy
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
to take
 
06:28:32.910 --> 06:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
them represent Maguire thank you Mr
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Dr for coming
 
06:28:40.030 --> 06:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
um regardless regarding your point about
 
06:28:42.830 --> 06:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
comparing the harms of alcohol to to
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis and also you said about your
 
06:28:48.910 --> 06:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
own addiction problem would you believe
 
06:28:50.830 --> 06:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
that if you were to go to the CDC
 
06:28:54.110 --> 06:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
website and look up whether cannabis is
 
06:28:57.830 --> 06:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
addictive it'll tell you 10% of users
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
are addicted okay but it has a reference
 
06:29:04.628 --> 06:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
to an article a medical article and when
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
you go look at that medical article this
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
is an arttic it from 2011 and it
 
06:29:12.110 --> 06:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
compared the
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
addictiveness of
 
06:29:14.638 --> 06:29:16.350 align:start position:0%
addictiveness of
nicotine

06:29:16.350 --> 06:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
nicotine
 
06:29:19.390 --> 06:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
cocaine alcohol and
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis okay and what the article
 
06:29:27.270 --> 06:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
actually says is nicotine 67%
 
06:29:31.110 --> 06:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
addictive alcohol 23%
 
06:29:37.270 --> 06:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
addictive cocaine 21% % day and cannabis
 
06:29:40.708 --> 06:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
9% so not not only did they raise 9% to
 
06:29:43.830 --> 06:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
10% right but but it sounds like when
 
06:29:45.750 --> 06:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
you first look at their page it's it's
 
06:29:49.670 --> 06:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
10% addictive oh my God but but it's
 
06:29:51.468 --> 06:29:51.478 align:start position:0%
it's half as much as cocaine you know
 
06:29:54.468 --> 06:29:54.478 align:start position:0%
what I mean so do is that comport with
 
06:29:56.590 --> 06:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
your understanding I know many people
 
06:29:58.350 --> 06:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
who are in recovery who actually use
 
06:30:00.590 --> 06:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh I know people who were heavy
 
06:30:04.468 --> 06:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
smokers who uh they may no longer smoke
 
06:30:06.390 --> 06:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or cigars or tobacco but they
 
06:30:08.510 --> 06:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
chew gum or use patches sometimes for
 
06:30:11.390 --> 06:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
years I'm one of those people I quit
 
06:30:13.670 --> 06:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
smoking cigarettes probably
 
06:30:17.070 --> 06:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
33 34 years ago 33 years ago smoke
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
cigars for a while now I chew gum all
 
06:30:20.468 --> 06:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
all the time all the time and I don't
 
06:30:22.150 --> 06:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
care about I don't have a problem with
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
going I don't mind if people smoke now I
 
06:30:25.390 --> 06:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
don't mind I don't have this urge to go
 
06:30:26.830 --> 06:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
have a cigar or do something that's more
 
06:30:28.510 --> 06:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
harmful to myself I have a way to
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
mitigate that harm that's what harm
 
06:30:32.350 --> 06:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
reduction is harm reduction and we keep
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
hearing the governor and other people
 
06:30:35.708 --> 06:30:35.718 align:start position:0%
talk about this is a harm reduction Bill
 
06:30:38.150 --> 06:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
not a money-making Bill well except the
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner talked about this is a
 
06:30:41.310 --> 06:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
business and you know so if we want it
 
06:30:42.990 --> 06:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
to be a business I think that's the
 
06:30:44.590 --> 06:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
person that should do this it's also a
 
06:30:46.030 --> 06:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
question I asked in the last Commission
 
06:30:48.830 --> 06:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
in 2018 I said you know I I praise them
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
for doing a great job at the commission
 
06:30:52.350 --> 06:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
they have a big advertising budget they
 
06:30:54.468 --> 06:30:54.478 align:start position:0%
do a great job getting a quality product
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
to as many people as they possibly can
 
06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
and raising a lot of money for the State
 
06:30:59.150 --> 06:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so if we wanted to sell
 
06:31:01.150 --> 06:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
as much cannabis as possible put them in
 
06:31:02.670 --> 06:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
charge of it now in the beginning it
 
06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
might be a slow roll out but in the end
 
06:31:08.030 --> 06:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
like with alcohol it's we don't have a
 
06:31:09.948 --> 06:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
alcohol control State anymore to keep
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
people from drinking or having access to
 
06:31:13.590 --> 06:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol that that ship has sailed a long
 
06:31:16.430 --> 06:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
time ago now that mandate to do that to
 
06:31:18.510 --> 06:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
do specifically that make it a safer
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
less accessible product is one of the
 
06:31:23.070 --> 06:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
biggest businesses in New Hampshire now
 
06:31:24.030 --> 06:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we're going to
 
06:31:26.190 --> 06:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
see if we set New Hampshire up to be a
 
06:31:28.910 --> 06:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
state purely run without having any
 
06:31:32.190 --> 06:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
other buyin uh from private sector I
 
06:31:34.430 --> 06:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a mistake um
 
06:31:36.190 --> 06:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't understand the 15 stores
 
06:31:37.628 --> 06:31:37.638 align:start position:0%
and I asked some Senators who were
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
pushing this and you know that heard
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
from the governor directly so I heard
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
indirectly that how are you going to
 
06:31:45.310 --> 06:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
have 15 stores unless they can the and
 
06:31:46.750 --> 06:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
we heard an industry person who I think
 
06:31:48.030 --> 06:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
might be here talk about that each store
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
would have to do about $2 million a
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
month in Revenue to to deal with the
 
06:31:53.070 --> 06:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
demand that's going to be in New
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a lot that's more than
 
06:31:57.110 --> 06:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
many of the state liquor stores actually
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
make but most of these liquor stores are
 
06:32:00.510 --> 06:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
not little You Know hole-in-the-wall
 
06:32:03.548 --> 06:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
Places they're giant you know Warehouse
 
06:32:06.750 --> 06:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
type Stores um you know that's how
 
06:32:08.350 --> 06:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to have 15 stores you're
 
06:32:09.708 --> 06:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
going to have to have these massive
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
structures that are going to be you know
 
06:32:12.750 --> 06:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's the only way it's going to work
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
if you have 15 little stores here and
 
06:32:16.590 --> 06:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
there nobody's going to be really going
 
06:32:18.628 --> 06:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
there unless they live around the corner
 
06:32:21.430 --> 06:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing is the state has
 
06:32:24.350 --> 06:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
the a mandate for this the sole sale of
 
06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
alcohol because the 21st amendment when
 
06:32:28.310 --> 06:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol prohibition was repealed
 
06:32:30.590 --> 06:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
specifically gave States the man the
 
06:32:32.910 --> 06:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
total control of Commerce of alcohol
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
within their states
 
06:32:36.990 --> 06:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen for any other
 
06:32:38.948 --> 06:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
product that I'm aware of so the fact
 
06:32:40.948 --> 06:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire State wants to take
 
06:32:42.510 --> 06:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
over the control of an industry that
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to do and the
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
argument is well it's illegal for them
 
06:32:47.548 --> 06:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
to do it and it's illegal for us so
 
06:32:48.708 --> 06:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
what's the difference if we break the
 
06:32:50.430 --> 06:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
law I think there's a big difference
 
06:32:51.750 --> 06:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
especially if we're looking at the
 
06:32:55.750 --> 06:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
long-term Financial impacts of a program
 
06:32:57.310 --> 06:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
that right now it's illegal to have
 
06:32:59.150 --> 06:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
Interstate sales but we're going to have
 
06:33:01.388 --> 06:33:01.398 align:start position:0%
a banking law change soon I believe I we
 
06:33:02.910 --> 06:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing it but I think it's very
 
06:33:04.270 --> 06:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
close we even heard the president talk
 
06:33:06.830 --> 06:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
about changes coming very soon with the
 
06:33:08.468 --> 06:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
rescheduling and also we're going to
 
06:33:10.910 --> 06:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
have banking changes so it's just a
 
06:33:12.708 --> 06:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
matter of time before we have some kind
 
06:33:14.628 --> 06:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
of Interstate sales or some kind of
 
06:33:16.388 --> 06:33:16.398 align:start position:0%
program to do that the reason why the
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
state is so so successful in alcohol
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
sales is because they have a legal and
 
06:33:23.948 --> 06:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
rightful Monopoly under the Constitution
 
06:33:25.510 --> 06:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the 21st amendment to be the only
 
06:33:27.670 --> 06:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
people to do it but they can also get it
 
06:33:28.948 --> 06:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
from anywhere they want they don't have
 
06:33:30.430 --> 06:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
to wait for a bunch of people that
 
06:33:31.990 --> 06:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
they've handed licenses to in New
 
06:33:34.110 --> 06:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to grow it they can go to Iona
 
06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
they can go to Italy they can go
 
06:33:36.990 --> 06:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
wherever they want and buy alcohol to
 
06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
sell in the New Hampshire stores that's
 
06:33:41.430 --> 06:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
why it works if you have only a market
 
06:33:43.190 --> 06:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and the state is the
 
06:33:44.350 --> 06:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
only person selling it how are they
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
going to compete with larger states with
 
06:33:48.468 --> 06:33:48.478 align:start position:0%
more outdoor growing or more uh lower
 
06:33:49.948 --> 06:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
energy costs they can do more indoor
 
06:33:51.830 --> 06:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
grows we are going to put ourselves at a
 
06:33:54.468 --> 06:33:54.478 align:start position:0%
significant disadvantage if we prop up
 
06:33:56.990 --> 06:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
this program and it might be a slow roll
 
06:33:57.910 --> 06:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
out in the beginning but then we're
 
06:33:59.750 --> 06:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to be stuck with it and you know
 
06:34:01.548 --> 06:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more temporary more
 
06:34:03.030 --> 06:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
permanent than a temporary government
 
06:34:04.708 --> 06:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
program so I don't think this is the way
 
06:34:07.070 --> 06:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
we should be doing this I can keep going
 
06:34:08.548 --> 06:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
and I'd love to rant but I know you have
 
06:34:11.110 --> 06:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
other people to hear and it's getting
 
06:34:14.150 --> 06:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
late seeing no further questions uh
 
06:34:20.510 --> 06:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:23.270 --> 06:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
all Matt
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:32.638 --> 06:34:43.468 align:start position:0%
 
cannabis

06:34:43.468 --> 06:34:43.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:45.230 --> 06:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
06:34:47.190 --> 06:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Matt Simon I
 
06:34:50.830 --> 06:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
work for granite Leaf cannabis uh we are
 
06:34:52.990 --> 06:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
one of the three licensed alternative
 
06:34:54.948 --> 06:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
treatment centers that supplies
 
06:34:57.670 --> 06:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis to uh just over
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
14,000 patients who are now registered
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
as part of New Hampshire's
 
06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:04.190 align:start position:0%
as part of New Hampshire's
program

06:35:04.190 --> 06:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:35:06.910 --> 06:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
so again we do support the bill uh we
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
support the Amendments that have been
 
06:35:10.708 --> 06:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
offered by the prime sponsor I'd like to
 
06:35:12.468 --> 06:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
thank the prime sponsor for all the hard
 
06:35:14.468 --> 06:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
work she's put in to trying to thread
 
06:35:17.030 --> 06:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
this difficult needle I've personally
 
06:35:19.350 --> 06:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
been working on cannabis policy for 17
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
years in the state and I'm pleased that
 
06:35:24.510 --> 06:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
we're finally close to being able to
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
pass a legalization Bill however I
 
06:35:29.628 --> 06:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
remain very concerned about some of the
 
06:35:32.310 --> 06:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
details uh just as some background I was
 
06:35:34.190 --> 06:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
part of the Coalition that helped write
 
06:35:37.230 --> 06:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
HB 639 so I'm very much on record as
 
06:35:40.750 --> 06:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
preferring that model uh and I'm on
 
06:35:42.788 --> 06:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
record as opposing the actual State
 
06:35:44.750 --> 06:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
Monopoly model that would have had state
 
06:35:47.868 --> 06:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
run stores uh this fall we participated
 
06:35:49.868 --> 06:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
in the study commission we were asked to
 
06:35:52.548 --> 06:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
comment on the franchise model and we
 
06:35:54.590 --> 06:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
indicated that we were willing to work
 
06:35:56.990 --> 06:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
within the framework of the franchise
 
06:35:59.388 --> 06:35:59.398 align:start position:0%
model I would respectfully disagree with
 
06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor uh that in the
 
06:36:05.190 --> 06:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
comparison with the State Monopoly model
 
06:36:06.910 --> 06:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
I believe if we were to go down the road
 
06:36:09.548 --> 06:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
of state run stores and then we were to
 
06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
find out that that is problematic from a
 
06:36:13.910 --> 06:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
legal perspective federally and there
 
06:36:16.070 --> 06:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
are a number of ways that could happen
 
06:36:17.548 --> 06:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
that it would be very difficult to
 
06:36:18.910 --> 06:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
change course the state would have
 
06:36:20.750 --> 06:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
already made a large investment and have
 
06:36:22.388 --> 06:36:22.398 align:start position:0%
gone down a path that would that would
 
06:36:25.030 --> 06:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
be very likely to wind up as a
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
boondoggle uh so I think the franchise
 
06:36:30.868 --> 06:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
model if it does it is a unique model so
 
06:36:33.788 --> 06:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
it may encounter difficulties uh but if
 
06:36:35.990 --> 06:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
it does I think it would be much easier
 
06:36:39.070 --> 06:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
to change some details and uh you would
 
06:36:40.948 --> 06:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
still have private businesses operating
 
06:36:43.270 --> 06:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
the franchise with some changes that
 
06:36:45.590 --> 06:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
could be made a a program that would be
 
06:36:47.910 --> 06:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
less problematic uh but I wanted to
 
06:36:49.350 --> 06:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
mainly comment on on what we've been
 
06:36:50.910 --> 06:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
asked to comment on throughout this
 
06:36:53.750 --> 06:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
process which is the impact on
 
06:36:56.110 --> 06:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
registered therapeutic cannabis uh
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
patients on the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:37:00.350 --> 06:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
program and on the atcs that that have
 
06:37:02.990 --> 06:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
been serving patients now for almost 8
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
years each
 
06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
um this is a program that has been under
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of scrutiny ever since it passed
 
06:37:12.310 --> 06:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh I would submit that if there had been
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
problems that you would have heard about
 
06:37:18.110 --> 06:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
them and read about them by now and uh I
 
06:37:19.830 --> 06:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the three companies that
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
have been doing this have been doing it
 
06:37:23.510 --> 06:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
under a microscope have complied with
 
06:37:25.990 --> 06:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
complex regulations
 
06:37:29.110 --> 06:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
and um both from a policy perspective
 
06:37:31.750 --> 06:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
but more uh to the relevance of the
 
06:37:33.670 --> 06:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
focus of this committee from a revenue
 
06:37:35.230 --> 06:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
perspective I think one of the biggest
 
06:37:37.030 --> 06:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
mistakes New Hampshire could make would
 
06:37:38.708 --> 06:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
be to try to move forward with cannabis
 
06:37:41.230 --> 06:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
legalization without incorporating the
 
06:37:43.150 --> 06:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
existing businesses and the existing
 
06:37:45.388 --> 06:37:45.398 align:start position:0%
program we've learned a lot in the last
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
eight years and it would be a shame to
 
06:37:50.388 --> 06:37:50.398 align:start position:0%
not do that New York is probably the
 
06:37:52.830 --> 06:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
biggest example of a state that tried to
 
06:37:55.070 --> 06:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
build a new adult use program from
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
scratch without incorporating medical
 
06:37:59.708 --> 06:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
canvas businesses and they're very much
 
06:38:02.070 --> 06:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
regretting it at this point uh and that
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
Pro that roll out has been
 
06:38:06.430 --> 06:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
a big disaster so it would it would be
 
06:38:09.468 --> 06:38:09.478 align:start position:0%
advantageous from a revenue uh and an
 
06:38:11.788 --> 06:38:11.798 align:start position:0%
easy rollout perspective if the existing
 
06:38:13.310 --> 06:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
businesses have a clear path to
 
06:38:16.750 --> 06:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
licensing and are able to participate in
 
06:38:19.910 --> 06:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
all of these license types it is the
 
06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
retail license that are by far of the
 
06:38:23.760 --> 06:38:24.628 align:start position:0%
retail license that are by far of the
most

06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
most
 
06:38:28.670 --> 06:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
interest uh Most states have seen fit to
 
06:38:30.430 --> 06:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
have existing medical cannabis
 
06:38:33.830 --> 06:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
businesses have a very easy if not a
 
06:38:37.190 --> 06:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
guaranteed path to licensing and uh
 
06:38:39.070 --> 06:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
generally it's as long as your
 
06:38:40.948 --> 06:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
application is complete your licens is
 
06:38:43.708 --> 06:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
in good standing you shall be issued
 
06:38:46.468 --> 06:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
this license so we proposed that to the
 
06:38:48.548 --> 06:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
study commission we encountered a lot of
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
opposition uh so the language that is in
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Amendment on this
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
establishes that it shall be a major
 
06:39:00.150 --> 06:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
criteria in the application process that
 
06:39:03.030 --> 06:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
at that previous experience that we have
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
oper ating in the state so we think that
 
06:39:08.628 --> 06:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
language is is very important uh one of
 
06:39:09.948 --> 06:39:09.958 align:start position:0%
the issues with the bills that came out
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
of Commerce was that language only
 
06:39:14.388 --> 06:39:14.398 align:start position:0%
applied to retail licenses it did not
 
06:39:17.110 --> 06:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
apply to the other license types so I
 
06:39:18.708 --> 06:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
believe the amendment although I haven't
 
06:39:20.830 --> 06:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment I believe that it
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
applies that same language to all of the
 
06:39:25.468 --> 06:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
license types and that's one reason I
 
06:39:29.230 --> 06:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
think it's very important um Vermont has
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
had adult use sales for about a year and
 
06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
a half now uh they've reportedly had a
 
06:39:36.788 --> 06:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
50% decrease in patient registrations
 
06:39:40.230 --> 06:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
and a similar decrease in sales within
 
06:39:43.788 --> 06:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
the medical cannabis space uh the report
 
06:39:46.190 --> 06:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I've passed around is a a research
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
report that we presented to the study
 
06:39:50.430 --> 06:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
commission uh looking at the experiences
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
of other states that have moved from
 
06:39:54.868 --> 06:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis to adult use and
 
06:39:57.468 --> 06:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
similarly finds that nearly all states
 
06:40:00.548 --> 06:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
have a major decrease in registered
 
06:40:02.948 --> 06:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
patients and in sales on the medical
 
06:40:05.948 --> 06:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
side so that is the biggest concern that
 
06:40:08.990 --> 06:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
we have is that this new program May
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
simply wipe away the the old
 
06:40:14.110 --> 06:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
program uh the commissioner in Vermont
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
warned the legislature in Vermont
 
06:40:17.788 --> 06:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
recently that the Standalone medical
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
dispensaries are in danger of closing no
 
06:40:21.750 --> 06:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
longer being
 
06:40:25.388 --> 06:40:25.398 align:start position:0%
viable basically as soon as you can buy
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis anywhere without having a card
 
06:40:30.628 --> 06:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh that removes people's incentive to
 
06:40:34.510 --> 06:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
get the card and uh you for now has 73
 
06:40:37.670 --> 06:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
retail locations they only have seven or
 
06:40:39.990 --> 06:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
eight uh medical dispensary locations so
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
you probably live much closer to an
 
06:40:44.350 --> 06:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
adult use store and the adult use stores
 
06:40:46.948 --> 06:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
are mostly giving patients a tax cut
 
06:40:48.350 --> 06:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying the taxes for the
 
06:40:50.910 --> 06:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
patients uh I've heard this informally
 
06:40:52.110 --> 06:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
that they're just oh if you show your
 
06:40:54.150 --> 06:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
card we will give you a discount that
 
06:40:56.750 --> 06:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
offsets the tax we'll pay the tax on
 
06:40:59.230 --> 06:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
your behalf so the current bill does
 
06:41:01.990 --> 06:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
exempt patients from the agency fee
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
which we think is appropriate
 
06:41:08.110 --> 06:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
um but if the atcs are not able to get
 
06:41:10.830 --> 06:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
at least one retail license a piece
 
06:41:13.350 --> 06:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
there is great danger that they will not
 
06:41:16.510 --> 06:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
be viable companies and that they will
 
06:41:18.670 --> 06:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
not be able to operate Standalone
 
06:41:21.510 --> 06:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
dispensaries so from our perspective if
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
there only going to be 15 licenses those
 
06:41:25.510 --> 06:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be very sought-after and in
 
06:41:28.868 --> 06:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
demand we think the atc's need at least
 
06:41:32.350 --> 06:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
one of them in order to be not only
 
06:41:35.230 --> 06:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
viable but able to
 
06:41:37.590 --> 06:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
improve the services we offer to
 
06:41:39.868 --> 06:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
patients this should be an opportunity
 
06:41:42.628 --> 06:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
to expand and improve access to patients
 
06:41:45.070 --> 06:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to extending access to
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
adults from our perspective most people
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
who use cannabis we hear the word
 
06:41:51.310 --> 06:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
recreational a lot I actually stopped
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
using it a long time ago because poll
 
06:41:55.468 --> 06:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
after poll of cannabis consumers
 
06:41:57.910 --> 06:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
indicates that most people who use
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis do so at least partly for
 
06:42:03.628 --> 06:42:03.638 align:start position:0%
medical reasons if not entirely so we
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose the program that
 
06:42:07.350 --> 06:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've got we want to learn from it and
 
06:42:09.030 --> 06:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
we want to incorporate it and integrate
 
06:42:12.948 --> 06:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
it into this so be happy to take any
 
06:42:15.270 --> 06:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate your comments I
 
06:42:17.388 --> 06:42:17.398 align:start position:0%
couldn't have said it better well thank
 
06:42:20.230 --> 06:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman so how many
 
06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
atcs are there in New Hampshire now you
 
06:42:25.350 --> 06:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
said six there are three companies
 
06:42:30.628 --> 06:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:32.788 --> 06:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
locations I know they grow a lot of my
 
06:42:34.708 --> 06:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
community of Peterboro there's a large
 
06:42:36.750 --> 06:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
facility there that's my company's
 
06:42:38.350 --> 06:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
production facility is is the one
 
06:42:41.910 --> 06:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
located in Peterboro so so right now is
 
06:42:43.150 --> 06:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
06:42:45.830 --> 06:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
Services they oversee your operation
 
06:42:49.788 --> 06:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
testing qualifying inspection all that
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
every aspect of it from seedling to sale
 
06:42:52.718 --> 06:42:54.350 align:start position:0%
every aspect of it from seedling to sale
patient

06:42:54.350 --> 06:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:42:56.910 --> 06:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
registrations so I I'll be candid as I
 
06:42:58.910 --> 06:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
try to be all the time but I think the
 
06:43:01.830 --> 06:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
15 store model is a disaster so I
 
06:43:03.910 --> 06:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with what you said that
 
06:43:05.628 --> 06:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
you folks are already in the business
 
06:43:07.868 --> 06:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
you know it you've got a long record of
 
06:43:10.070 --> 06:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
doing it without a heavy hand of the
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
state so just want to put that out there
 
06:43:16.388 --> 06:43:16.398 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you thank you Mr
 
06:43:19.070 --> 06:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Simon for coming
 
06:43:22.788 --> 06:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
um so if the atc's
 
06:43:25.110 --> 06:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
converted in under these
 
06:43:28.948 --> 06:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
bills would that be seven of the 15 or
 
06:43:32.270 --> 06:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
three of the 15 or how does that work so
 
06:43:33.868 --> 06:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
what Most states have done is they have
 
06:43:39.750 --> 06:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
allowed dual use retail so you have a
 
06:43:42.708 --> 06:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
medical dispensary you create a separate
 
06:43:44.750 --> 06:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
counter for adult youth sales a separate
 
06:43:47.030 --> 06:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
counter for medical sales you operate
 
06:43:49.230 --> 06:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
from the same location this is obviously
 
06:43:51.270 --> 06:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
much cheaper and more efficient way to
 
06:43:54.788 --> 06:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
have a roll out that's what we would
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
prefer to have and that's what was in HB
 
06:43:59.510 --> 06:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
639 which got 10 votes in the Senate but
 
06:44:02.270 --> 06:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
did not become law uh there are some on
 
06:44:04.750 --> 06:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
the study Commission who objected to
 
06:44:07.750 --> 06:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
that I won't put words in their mouth to
 
06:44:09.388 --> 06:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
try to explain why they did but they
 
06:44:11.510 --> 06:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
felt it would be unfair to
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
allow our businesses to have any
 
06:44:18.830 --> 06:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
advantage in the licensing process uh so
 
06:44:21.150 --> 06:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
we we're willing to live with some
 
06:44:24.310 --> 06:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
degree of un uncertainty uh the prospect
 
06:44:26.030 --> 06:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
of this moving forward without us
 
06:44:28.750 --> 06:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
getting any retail licenses it puts not
 
06:44:30.788 --> 06:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
only our companies but the entire
 
06:44:34.030 --> 06:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
program in Jeopardy so so understanding
 
06:44:35.270 --> 06:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we weren't going to get a
 
06:44:38.070 --> 06:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
guaranteed license uh out of the Senate
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
we instead pushed for this language that
 
06:44:44.590 --> 06:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
we feel reduces the risk uh both to the
 
06:44:46.548 --> 06:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
program and to our
 
06:44:49.590 --> 06:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
companies sure so so I heard a story at
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
lunch about someone who a patient who
 
06:44:57.070 --> 06:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
chooses not to buy in the the local
 
06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
store the the medical store in New
 
06:45:01.430 --> 06:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they they go to Vermont
 
06:45:03.270 --> 06:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
because the price is so much cheaper or
 
06:45:05.910 --> 06:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
just in the regular retail store would
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
prices for medical come way down if this
 
06:45:12.270 --> 06:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
bill passes well I believe they would it
 
06:45:14.430 --> 06:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
would one of there are several issues
 
06:45:15.910 --> 06:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
that contribute to higher costs of
 
06:45:19.270 --> 06:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis in New Hampshire one is
 
06:45:20.788 --> 06:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have to grow entirely
 
06:45:22.830 --> 06:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
indoors there's a bill that would change
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
that uh other states allow outdoor and
 
06:45:27.230 --> 06:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
greenh Greenhouse cultivation which is
 
06:45:30.670 --> 06:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
much cheaper that's just one of many um
 
06:45:32.388 --> 06:45:32.398 align:start position:0%
the other is the limited number of
 
06:45:34.070 --> 06:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
patients so when there were only a few
 
06:45:36.548 --> 06:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
thousand patients and we're all creating
 
06:45:39.110 --> 06:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
a broad range of products and making
 
06:45:40.868 --> 06:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
very small batches of them we're not
 
06:45:43.310 --> 06:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
able to benefit from the economies of
 
06:45:45.910 --> 06:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
scale whereas if we could expand our
 
06:45:48.708 --> 06:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
production facility grow more cannabis
 
06:45:51.548 --> 06:45:51.558 align:start position:0%
for adults also be a we we would be able
 
06:45:54.150 --> 06:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
to pass those cost savings on to
 
06:45:55.590 --> 06:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
patients there were some Provisions in
 
06:45:59.708 --> 06:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
HB 639 that would have spelled that out
 
06:46:02.910 --> 06:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
more clearly and required us to uh
 
06:46:05.948 --> 06:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
maintain low costs and a broad uh
 
06:46:08.190 --> 06:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
Services broad spectrum of products for
 
06:46:09.910 --> 06:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
patients I'm afraid that's not in the
 
06:46:11.990 --> 06:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
current bill but uh it's certainly very
 
06:46:13.430 --> 06:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
much Our intention we want to make
 
06:46:15.430 --> 06:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis more affordable we
 
06:46:17.628 --> 06:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
have decreased our prices o over the
 
06:46:20.310 --> 06:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
last couple of years uh some of those
 
06:46:21.948 --> 06:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
patients aren't checking our menu often
 
06:46:23.548 --> 06:46:23.558 align:start position:0%
and may not be aware of that but we've
 
06:46:25.788 --> 06:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
worked hard to get our prices down and
 
06:46:29.310 --> 06:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
this would enable us to do that more I
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
believe further
 
06:46:33.990 --> 06:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:47:01.830 --> 06:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:01.840 --> 06:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

06:47:07.190 --> 06:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:09.388 --> 06:47:09.398 align:start position:0%
Senor good afternoon thank you for
 
06:47:12.190 --> 06:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
having me for the record Senator Daryl
 
06:47:14.150 --> 06:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
abbis I represent District 22 I serve
 
06:47:16.708 --> 06:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
the communities of pum Salem ACC and
 
06:47:19.468 --> 06:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
plastow I am testifying in opposition to
 
06:47:23.070 --> 06:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
the the draft because um I can go into
 
06:47:24.990 --> 06:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
the specifics why but I do know I heard
 
06:47:26.708 --> 06:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimonies saying this
 
06:47:28.388 --> 06:47:28.398 align:start position:0%
this will pass and this will get
 
06:47:30.310 --> 06:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
supported that draft does not have to
 
06:47:32.110 --> 06:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
support in the state inate at least by
 
06:47:35.388 --> 06:47:35.398 align:start position:0%
my whip count there's 24 of us I would
 
06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
say 10 at best so so that's a d I'm
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
sorry that's a draft that we received a
 
06:47:43.310 --> 06:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
copy of at the beginning of the hearing
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
no no what what was I believe passed the
 
06:47:49.670 --> 06:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce Bill yes so your there's and
 
06:47:51.070 --> 06:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
when I say there's some opposition to
 
06:47:53.150 --> 06:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
that I I understand that this this has
 
06:47:54.388 --> 06:47:54.398 align:start position:0%
been something been worked on for
 
06:47:57.948 --> 06:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
multiple years and it's really a um
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
compromise among several individuals and
 
06:48:03.270 --> 06:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
I would point out
 
06:48:05.430 --> 06:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the compromis from people
 
06:48:07.070 --> 06:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
who had traditionally voted against
 
06:48:09.590 --> 06:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization including myself
 
06:48:10.868 --> 06:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
if anyone serving the house of me last
 
06:48:13.270 --> 06:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
two terms it doesn't matter if it was
 
06:48:14.708 --> 06:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
roll called I I was doing the floor
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
speeches in opposition to many of the
 
06:48:21.548 --> 06:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
bills so I think it's fair to say I I'm
 
06:48:23.030 --> 06:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
just trying to be as transparent as
 
06:48:25.270 --> 06:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
possible wouldn't expect anything less
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
from you so yeah well um so the we just
 
06:48:30.750 --> 06:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
got a copy I guess this is your proposal
 
06:48:33.190 --> 06:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
that we just got a received a copy today
 
06:48:34.110 --> 06:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take credit for the
 
06:48:35.708 --> 06:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
whole document because like I said it's
 
06:48:37.708 --> 06:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
a compromise so every provision in there
 
06:48:40.350 --> 06:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
myself I may not necessarily personally
 
06:48:42.230 --> 06:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
agree with but it's something that I
 
06:48:44.310 --> 06:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
would support as part of the compromise
 
06:48:46.430 --> 06:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the compromises is the
 
06:48:49.750 --> 06:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
franchise model uh if last ter we had HB
 
06:48:53.468 --> 06:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
98 that was the full State Control model
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
where the state would really run the
 
06:48:57.750 --> 06:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
store and the state employees be working
 
06:48:59.590 --> 06:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the store they would pay to build out
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the store I my opinion I actually like
 
06:49:04.628 --> 06:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
that the best the compromise between
 
06:49:06.948 --> 06:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
that and just a you know an open market
 
06:49:10.830 --> 06:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
was the State Franchise model and I
 
06:49:12.430 --> 06:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
think there been some criticism over the
 
06:49:14.510 --> 06:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
amount of stores that's part of the
 
06:49:16.750 --> 06:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
compromise as well will that number stay
 
06:49:20.070 --> 06:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
at 15 five 10 years from now highly
 
06:49:22.510 --> 06:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
doubtful but I also think what other
 
06:49:24.310 --> 06:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
states did they kind of came out too
 
06:49:26.190 --> 06:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
fast and you saw the market kind of
 
06:49:28.468 --> 06:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
collapse on itself for some reason every
 
06:49:30.070 --> 06:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
single state has done that I can't
 
06:49:32.350 --> 06:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
imagine why every other state that wants
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
to follow that same direction I rather
 
06:49:38.030 --> 06:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
start slow and go the opposite way and
 
06:49:39.788 --> 06:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
then take our time because when the
 
06:49:41.628 --> 06:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
market drops out you have stores going
 
06:49:44.430 --> 06:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
out of business in a franchise model if
 
06:49:47.230 --> 06:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
one goes out out of business it's bad
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
for the brand itself The Branding
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
identity if there's a fast food chain
 
06:49:53.190 --> 06:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
and a store goes out of business it
 
06:49:55.868 --> 06:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
makes the brand look bad so the idea is
 
06:49:57.350 --> 06:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
that you want to protect your
 
06:49:58.948 --> 06:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
franchisees you don't want to put
 
06:50:01.590 --> 06:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
someone in business set them up only to
 
06:50:04.430 --> 06:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
have them fail so the idea is we rather
 
06:50:07.070 --> 06:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
them have over demand that they can't
 
06:50:08.788 --> 06:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
even keep up with the demand and that's
 
06:50:11.190 --> 06:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
a very good reason to come to the
 
06:50:13.868 --> 06:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
legislator and ask for more stores but
 
06:50:15.150 --> 06:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
right now I know if you change that
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
number from 15 to 16 it's it breaks the
 
06:50:21.628 --> 06:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
compromise so I would just recommend in
 
06:50:23.270 --> 06:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
whatever version we have we leave it at
 
06:50:25.548 --> 06:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
that future legislators I'm sure can
 
06:50:29.030 --> 06:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
look into that uh some of the other I
 
06:50:32.310 --> 06:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
think uh difficult issues that is the
 
06:50:35.190 --> 06:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
over it I believe the bill that came out
 
06:50:37.708 --> 06:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
of uh Commerce there was dual oversight
 
06:50:41.230 --> 06:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
between DHHS and the Liquor Commission
 
06:50:42.948 --> 06:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the enforceability of
 
06:50:45.548 --> 06:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
the rules uh and in respect to some of
 
06:50:47.388 --> 06:50:47.398 align:start position:0%
the rules that came up in different
 
06:50:48.948 --> 06:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
hearings we had over the fall in the in
 
06:50:51.708 --> 06:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
the the Cannabis commission that we had
 
06:50:53.230 --> 06:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
some of those rules seem very difficult
 
06:50:55.430 --> 06:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
to enforce once the product's in the
 
06:50:55.440 --> 06:50:57.030 align:start position:0%
to enforce once the product's in the
retail

06:50:57.030 --> 06:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
retail
 
06:50:59.548 --> 06:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
store liquor needs to be in charge of
 
06:51:00.628 --> 06:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
enforcing that but they're not going to
 
06:51:02.750 --> 06:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
have any saying what the rules are so it
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
seemed kind of
 
06:51:06.468 --> 06:51:06.478 align:start position:0%
a it didn't seem like that was going to
 
06:51:09.310 --> 06:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
work so I think the commission really
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
adjusted from that so I think you're
 
06:51:14.030 --> 06:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to have therapeutic products in
 
06:51:15.510 --> 06:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
every single franchise store every
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
franchise you can sell therapeutic
 
06:51:18.868 --> 06:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
products so you don't need to have this
 
06:51:21.468 --> 06:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
dual license issue it's if you have the
 
06:51:24.070 --> 06:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic card you're going to be able
 
06:51:26.350 --> 06:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
to buy it if you don't have it then you
 
06:51:27.910 --> 06:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't buy the therapeutic grade product
 
06:51:29.548 --> 06:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
that's defined in what was provided to
 
06:51:32.750 --> 06:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
the committee today I think when it
 
06:51:34.830 --> 06:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
looks at some of the um I Heard the lob
 
06:51:36.670 --> 06:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
the issue with the lobbying language hey
 
06:51:39.150 --> 06:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
I get it we all love free speech I don't
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a First Amendment violation
 
06:51:42.788 --> 06:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
for two reasons number one you're
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
voluntarily opting into a franchise
 
06:51:47.468 --> 06:51:47.478 align:start position:0%
agreement how have you ever seen any
 
06:51:49.708 --> 06:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
franchise in any industry where
 
06:51:51.070 --> 06:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
franchisees coming before the
 
06:51:53.070 --> 06:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
legislature going against the franchise
 
06:51:55.110 --> 06:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
or I've never heard of that happening
 
06:51:57.230 --> 06:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
because it's in the franchise agreement
 
06:52:00.270 --> 06:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
to not do that if you have all these
 
06:52:01.788 --> 06:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
franchisees paddling in different
 
06:52:03.910 --> 06:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
directions the hire things going to be a
 
06:52:06.670 --> 06:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
disaster on top of that the Liquor
 
06:52:08.708 --> 06:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
Commission they're not allowed to have a
 
06:52:10.830 --> 06:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyist so they can't even actually
 
06:52:11.788 --> 06:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to come in
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and they're not going to be
 
06:52:14.548 --> 06:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
to put the same money into it that
 
06:52:16.230 --> 06:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's the reason now we could did a
 
06:52:17.510 --> 06:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
better job explaining that during the
 
06:52:19.310 --> 06:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
commission this fall so I'll take some
 
06:52:20.910 --> 06:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that but that is a
 
06:52:23.590 --> 06:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
huge issue also the first amendment
 
06:52:25.708 --> 06:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
restricts it says the government shall
 
06:52:27.350 --> 06:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
not restrict a person
 
06:52:30.270 --> 06:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
speech if you're operating in a business
 
06:52:32.510 --> 06:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
relationship as a quasi state agent
 
06:52:35.310 --> 06:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
offering a franchisee you're essentially
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
a government actor
 
06:52:39.750 --> 06:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
yourself so I don't think it's a
 
06:52:41.350 --> 06:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
violation of the First Amendment for
 
06:52:42.628 --> 06:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
that reason and there's an interest to
 
06:52:45.070 --> 06:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
not have that if every other franchise
 
06:52:48.310 --> 06:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
agreement are is doing that so I I don't
 
06:52:50.948 --> 06:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be the um the end
 
06:52:52.670 --> 06:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
all be all this there is a severability
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
clause if one of the franchises really
 
06:52:56.548 --> 06:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
wants to take that and challenge that
 
06:52:57.830 --> 06:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it where it gets struck down the
 
06:53:00.070 --> 06:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill will survive we did put
 
06:53:03.628 --> 06:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
that in in the um the paperwork
 
06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
some of the revenue allocations are
 
06:53:08.270 --> 06:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
different I um talking with some of my
 
06:53:09.868 --> 06:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the other side of the wall
 
06:53:12.230 --> 06:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the house we kind of discussed we
 
06:53:14.830 --> 06:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
thought that Community um not sure if
 
06:53:15.830 --> 06:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm calling it right the community
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
preservation or Community investment
 
06:53:18.990 --> 06:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
fund we didn't think that we thought
 
06:53:20.270 --> 06:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
that was too diluted to really make a
 
06:53:21.628 --> 06:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
significant difference not that there
 
06:53:24.270 --> 06:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
was any um anything in there that we had
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
an issue with and so much it was just
 
06:53:28.350 --> 06:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
too it was cut up too many times um I
 
06:53:30.070 --> 06:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
think the big sale sales pitch I had
 
06:53:31.750 --> 06:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
last term when I was in the house was
 
06:53:33.628 --> 06:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
property taxes property taxes property
 
06:53:36.190 --> 06:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
taxes so I re reallocate most that to
 
06:53:38.910 --> 06:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
the to the swept one of the compromises
 
06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
was to put some money towards some legal
 
06:53:44.750 --> 06:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
aid uh the reason for that is you know I
 
06:53:46.030 --> 06:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
understand there's different opinions on
 
06:53:49.708 --> 06:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
the injustices of illegal cannabis to
 
06:53:51.070 --> 06:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
the extent that that exists ultimately
 
06:53:53.788 --> 06:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
the best way to address that is with
 
06:53:56.110 --> 06:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
legal representation our nonprofit Legal
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
Services already underfunded anyway I'm
 
06:53:59.388 --> 06:53:59.398 align:start position:0%
sure this committee is well aware of
 
06:54:01.910 --> 06:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
that so that was kind of a compromise we
 
06:54:03.948 --> 06:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
came up with with
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh the smoking in
 
06:54:09.708 --> 06:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
public if you get caught smoking in
 
06:54:12.030 --> 06:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
public multiple times which is when the
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor would in in invoke
 
06:54:17.388 --> 06:54:17.398 align:start position:0%
itself I'm not sure you're even trying
 
06:54:19.788 --> 06:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
to hide it it's really a difficult thing
 
06:54:21.388 --> 06:54:21.398 align:start position:0%
to get caught doing never mind multiple
 
06:54:23.868 --> 06:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
times and the number one complaint I get
 
06:54:26.468 --> 06:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
from people who oppose legalization is
 
06:54:28.628 --> 06:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
the when you go to Massachusetts a main
 
06:54:31.388 --> 06:54:31.398 align:start position:0%
or New York all you can do is smell it
 
06:54:33.468 --> 06:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
so some of us
 
06:54:35.030 --> 06:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to go to our constituent
 
06:54:36.788 --> 06:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
constituents and actually put a penalty
 
06:54:39.990 --> 06:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's we can explain well we may allow
 
06:54:41.430 --> 06:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
Recreation but we're not going we're
 
06:54:44.030 --> 06:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
going to be tough on public use
 
06:54:46.110 --> 06:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
especially for repeat offenders to get
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
caught violing that you had to reach in
 
06:54:49.670 --> 06:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
your pocket or whatever you got your bag
 
06:54:52.110 --> 06:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
pull it out literally light it and smoke
 
06:54:53.868 --> 06:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
it and still get caught doing it you're
 
06:54:55.030 --> 06:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
going out of your way you're willfully
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
ignoring the law there's no excuse for
 
06:54:58.750 --> 06:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
anyone to get caught violating that
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
multiple times unless they just
 
06:55:02.788 --> 06:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
completely disregard the law so that's
 
06:55:04.190 --> 06:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
part of a compromise and for the people
 
06:55:06.910 --> 06:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
who are against the idea of the you know
 
06:55:09.190 --> 06:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
having this this type of penalty I think
 
06:55:10.670 --> 06:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a they're getting a lot more
 
06:55:13.510 --> 06:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
than they giving up that's that's in my
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
opinion uh the comparisons to alcohol
 
06:55:19.388 --> 06:55:19.398 align:start position:0%
which I believe was legalized about 90
 
06:55:22.628 --> 06:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
years ago it evolved over time I think
 
06:55:25.510 --> 06:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
this will too Rome wasn't built in a day
 
06:55:27.750 --> 06:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a good starting point but with
 
06:55:30.628 --> 06:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
what's presented with this agency
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
model it's a re branding of what just is
 
06:55:36.150 --> 06:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
was the in the private lies they changed
 
06:55:38.110 --> 06:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
the name of it to a retail outlet store
 
06:55:40.590 --> 06:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
you're just giving a person a license to
 
06:55:43.350 --> 06:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
sell operate a retail store that's it
 
06:55:45.910 --> 06:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
you can call whatever you want but it's
 
06:55:48.190 --> 06:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
not it's not any different than really
 
06:55:51.708 --> 06:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
what was in 16 uh 639 it's just simple
 
06:55:54.270 --> 06:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
as that that that's a non-starter with
 
06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
me I can I can say that with confidence
 
06:56:00.230 --> 06:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
so um some of the other things I would
 
06:56:02.468 --> 06:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
just point out the possession limits a
 
06:56:04.190 --> 06:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
raised significantly I don't know if
 
06:56:05.468 --> 06:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
it's the same as what was in the
 
06:56:07.468 --> 06:56:07.478 align:start position:0%
Commerce version but we're talking about
 
06:56:11.190 --> 06:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
4 ounces of flour significantly higher
 
06:56:12.388 --> 06:56:12.398 align:start position:0%
so that's the other reason why you want
 
06:56:13.830 --> 06:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
to take into consideration some of the
 
06:56:16.270 --> 06:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
driving laws and public use laws is that
 
06:56:17.510 --> 06:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're allowing people to have much
 
06:56:20.270 --> 06:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
larger quantities on them than 3/4 of an
 
06:56:23.590 --> 06:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
ounce so some of the other I would just
 
06:56:25.590 --> 06:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
say important things I I hear the issue
 
06:56:27.270 --> 06:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
of liquor controlling the price and not
 
06:56:29.830 --> 06:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
controlling the price understand and
 
06:56:31.388 --> 06:56:31.398 align:start position:0%
this happened in Massachusetts it's
 
06:56:33.788 --> 06:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
happened in other states States some
 
06:56:36.230 --> 06:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
cultivators may also operate a
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
franchisee some may not and if you're
 
06:56:42.430 --> 06:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
one if you're cultivated you can grow a
 
06:56:44.430 --> 06:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
lot flood the market with your product
 
06:56:46.990 --> 06:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
causes the price to go down some
 
06:56:50.468 --> 06:56:50.478 align:start position:0%
franchisees may be able to operate at a
 
06:56:52.750 --> 06:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
loss for some time some may not not
 
06:56:53.788 --> 06:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to have the same
 
06:56:56.990 --> 06:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
Financial stability as the next well one
 
06:56:58.670 --> 06:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's obviously you don't want that to
 
06:56:59.830 --> 06:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
happen to a
 
06:57:01.628 --> 06:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
franchisee because it makes the brand
 
06:57:04.868 --> 06:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
look bad back to that but also if liquor
 
06:57:06.310 --> 06:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
can control the price and someone did
 
06:57:07.628 --> 06:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
attempt to manipulate the market which
 
06:57:09.310 --> 06:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
has happened like clockwork in literally
 
06:57:09.320 --> 06:57:10.350 align:start position:0%
has happened like clockwork in literally
every

06:57:10.350 --> 06:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:57:12.750 --> 06:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
state if they can control the sale price
 
06:57:14.708 --> 06:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
guess what it doesn't matter they a
 
06:57:16.388 --> 06:57:16.398 align:start position:0%
cultivator chose to do that and guess
 
06:57:19.230 --> 06:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
what this is what the price is so that's
 
06:57:21.150 --> 06:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
it it stops that it actually is a
 
06:57:22.990 --> 06:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
protection for the franchisees you don't
 
06:57:25.468 --> 06:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
want something like that to happen uh I
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
think when it it comes to some of the
 
06:57:28.990 --> 06:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
finance questions I would obviously
 
06:57:31.990 --> 06:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
welcome any input on the the draft that
 
06:57:34.110 --> 06:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
was provideed to this committee today uh
 
06:57:36.388 --> 06:57:36.398 align:start position:0%
what I understand just looking at voting
 
06:57:38.030 --> 06:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
records of some of my colleagues in in
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate if you look at the finance
 
06:57:42.150 --> 06:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee I would be surprised it came
 
06:57:44.110 --> 06:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
out with a negative uh if it came out
 
06:57:46.430 --> 06:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
with a positive recommendation unless
 
06:57:47.750 --> 06:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
someone changes their mind who's
 
06:57:49.708 --> 06:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
historically been against it so with
 
06:57:52.388 --> 06:57:52.398 align:start position:0%
that being said I think this this is the
 
06:57:53.548 --> 06:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
finance committee that would give it the
 
06:57:55.548 --> 06:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
best shot and I think it in
 
06:57:58.190 --> 06:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
fairness I would welcome that because
 
06:58:01.030 --> 06:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
whatever became law I should really I
 
06:58:02.430 --> 06:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
think I would really value value the
 
06:58:04.468 --> 06:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
input of the fin of both finances
 
06:58:06.350 --> 06:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee but I don't see the votes
 
06:58:08.670 --> 06:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
coming out as friendly across the wall
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
so for that reason when I know that
 
06:58:12.548 --> 06:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
there's a version that would get signed
 
06:58:14.310 --> 06:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
I say I'm not saying this draft that's
 
06:58:15.708 --> 06:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
written would get signed I wouldn't put
 
06:58:17.070 --> 06:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
something forward that I didn't think
 
06:58:19.750 --> 06:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
would become law so part of the
 
06:58:21.788 --> 06:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
compromise is that this is as close as I
 
06:58:23.190 --> 06:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
think it's going to
 
06:58:25.430 --> 06:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
get if you understand where I'm coming
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
from I wouldn't put something in there
 
06:58:29.708 --> 06:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
that I thought was a deal
 
06:58:31.868 --> 06:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
breaker well thanks for your testimon no
 
06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
will give this a deep dive of
 
06:58:35.628 --> 06:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh we just got it
 
06:58:38.150 --> 06:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
today your Amendment and as someone and
 
06:58:39.510 --> 06:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
I know when you were in the house you
 
06:58:43.388 --> 06:58:43.398 align:start position:0%
were advocate for medical marijuana and
 
06:58:45.070 --> 06:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
U I don't I don't believe I was as
 
06:58:46.830 --> 06:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
strong of an advocate for the
 
06:58:49.830 --> 06:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic well you weren't not not as
 
06:58:51.150 --> 06:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
much as they when you were in criminal
 
06:58:52.910 --> 06:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
justice I thought you
 
06:58:55.948 --> 06:58:55.958 align:start position:0%
were so when it comes to the therap
 
06:58:58.788 --> 06:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
there's some one benefit that the draft
 
06:59:00.750 --> 06:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
you have I'm just kidding I I think when
 
06:59:02.868 --> 06:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
it comes to the therapeutic
 
06:59:05.628 --> 06:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
product if any retail store is able to
 
06:59:07.548 --> 06:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
sell it they have more distribution
 
06:59:11.150 --> 06:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
points also any franchise fee that's in
 
06:59:13.868 --> 06:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
there every product would be subject to
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
that franchise fee and I don't think
 
06:59:18.548 --> 06:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
that some people kind of bck at that and
 
06:59:20.590 --> 06:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
they say well oh the patient it
 
06:59:22.670 --> 06:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay for that the
 
06:59:25.548 --> 06:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutic the uh the therapeutic
 
06:59:27.430 --> 06:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
providers now if they become a retail
 
06:59:28.548 --> 06:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
store they're going to make plenty of
 
06:59:30.788 --> 06:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
extra money off the retail sales that
 
06:59:31.830 --> 06:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to pass that on to
 
06:59:34.230 --> 06:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
the a and they're also going to be able
 
06:59:35.948 --> 06:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
to distribute their product through
 
06:59:38.350 --> 06:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
multiple retail outlets as opposed to
 
06:59:40.310 --> 06:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the stores they have now so they'll
 
06:59:42.230 --> 06:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
be in a better position as well we're
 
06:59:44.430 --> 06:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
not guaranteeing anyone a license I'm
 
06:59:45.670 --> 06:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
heavily opposed to that I just don't
 
06:59:47.388 --> 06:59:47.398 align:start position:0%
think that that's proper for the
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislator to do I I think it's fair to
 
06:59:52.750 --> 06:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
set up a pathway to get one in take into
 
06:59:55.230 --> 06:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
consideration someone's uh professional
 
06:59:57.110 --> 06:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
experience including working in the
 
06:59:59.230 --> 06:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic industry but the guarantee
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
of license I think is highly
 
07:00:01.788 --> 07:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
inappropriate if we were going to go
 
07:00:03.670 --> 07:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
that wrote I would certainly put my name
 
07:00:05.750 --> 07:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
on that list the guarantee license and
 
07:00:07.230 --> 07:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
any of you find that egregious is
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
exactly why you shouldn't do
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:16.310 --> 07:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
Senator um did I just hear you say that
 
07:00:21.868 --> 07:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
that a a len will have multiple
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
locations I thought it was this is
 
07:00:26.628 --> 07:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
limited to 15 locations then that's it
 
07:00:30.670 --> 07:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
so a therapeutic um someone the
 
07:00:32.990 --> 07:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic stores now if they wanted to
 
07:00:34.788 --> 07:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
become a franchisee they're doing that
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
under their own no one's making them do
 
07:00:38.750 --> 07:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
anything they're choosing to become a
 
07:00:40.190 --> 07:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
franchisee they're asking they're fill
 
07:00:41.830 --> 07:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
out the application if they get
 
07:00:43.990 --> 07:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
approved but their product that they
 
07:00:46.750 --> 07:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
manufacture and that they cultivate that
 
07:00:49.270 --> 07:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
can be sold out of any retail store
 
07:00:50.948 --> 07:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's as their as them as the
 
07:00:53.310 --> 07:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and cultivator that's up to
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
them if they want to sell that and if
 
07:00:56.270 --> 07:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
they want to educate the employees and
 
07:00:56.280 --> 07:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
they want to educate the employees and
those

07:00:57.670 --> 07:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
franchisees uh they can do that but that
 
07:01:03.548 --> 07:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
gives them much more opportunities to uh
 
07:01:05.548 --> 07:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
distribute their product I understand
 
07:01:08.708 --> 07:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
okay so this might be a good time um I
 
07:01:10.948 --> 07:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
met somewhat I know you've talked to the
 
07:01:13.750 --> 07:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
governor extensively and I've met uh
 
07:01:16.788 --> 07:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
with his representative the other uh the
 
07:01:20.430 --> 07:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
other day and he gave me a list of items
 
07:01:22.628 --> 07:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
that for the governor is sort of a
 
07:01:25.350 --> 07:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
must-have and and you know I don't mind
 
07:01:27.990 --> 07:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
saying the quiet part out loud of it
 
07:01:31.270 --> 07:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
which is what he his message to me was
 
07:01:32.910 --> 07:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
07:01:35.628 --> 07:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't really want this that much right
 
07:01:38.110 --> 07:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
he he he he would not be super upset if
 
07:01:40.708 --> 07:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come to pass or if it did
 
07:01:43.868 --> 07:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
come to pass he's somewhat neutral right
 
07:01:45.868 --> 07:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
and so therefore since he's the one who
 
07:01:50.350 --> 07:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
cares the least he has the most
 
07:01:52.750 --> 07:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
control if you see what I mean right
 
07:01:54.310 --> 07:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
checks and balance is at its best by the
 
07:01:55.990 --> 07:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
way yeah that's what that's what our
 
07:01:58.150 --> 07:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
system of government is is that we we're
 
07:02:00.350 --> 07:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to work across the wall right
 
07:02:02.670 --> 07:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
into the other divisions cross party
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
lines that's what we're supposed to do
 
07:02:07.030 --> 07:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
so this is really this is a bipartison
 
07:02:09.510 --> 07:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue that I hoping we all work together
 
07:02:11.030 --> 07:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to come in here and say
 
07:02:12.910 --> 07:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
oh this has no what I'm just trying to
 
07:02:15.430 --> 07:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
be honest because in my own committee I
 
07:02:17.030 --> 07:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
sit on the the Judiciary Committee which
 
07:02:19.190 --> 07:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
I believe would be the first committee
 
07:02:20.388 --> 07:02:20.398 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly confident if you look at the
 
07:02:22.388 --> 07:02:22.398 align:start position:0%
voting records in there it's already
 
07:02:22.398 --> 07:02:23.150 align:start position:0%
voting records in there it's already
pretty

07:02:23.150 --> 07:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
07:02:26.110 --> 07:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
tight yeah all right well anyways I'd
 
07:02:29.868 --> 07:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
like to read these and see if you um
 
07:02:31.350 --> 07:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
agree that these are what the governor
 
07:02:33.190 --> 07:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
wants and and also that that's what's in
 
07:02:36.110 --> 07:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
your Amendment okay number one it's not
 
07:02:37.350 --> 07:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
just mine it's a remember it's a
 
07:02:39.830 --> 07:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
collective effort all right fine but you
 
07:02:42.468 --> 07:02:42.478 align:start position:0%
you were the drafter I believe all right
 
07:02:45.190 --> 07:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not even taking credit for that okay
 
07:02:48.070 --> 07:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh the franchise model run by The Liquor
 
07:02:50.788 --> 07:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
Commission that that is one that is 100%
 
07:02:54.708 --> 07:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
in there okay uh no smoking in public no
 
07:02:56.310 --> 07:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
use public use
 
07:02:58.990 --> 07:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah well the first offense is
 
07:03:01.910 --> 07:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
still a violation and that was for me
 
07:03:03.190 --> 07:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
compromise cuz I still think getting
 
07:03:05.948 --> 07:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
caught the first time is egregious but
 
07:03:07.670 --> 07:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay trying to work with everyone here
 
07:03:10.310 --> 07:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
are you okay with the class B Mr meanor
 
07:03:13.388 --> 07:03:13.398 align:start position:0%
or the third offense or whatever second
 
07:03:15.628 --> 07:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
offense I I think the compromise may
 
07:03:17.310 --> 07:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
require the second offense to be a
 
07:03:17.320 --> 07:03:19.830 align:start position:0%
require the second offense to be a
misdemeanor

07:03:19.830 --> 07:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
07:03:23.590 --> 07:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's oh as opposed to a class B M yes
 
07:03:25.468 --> 07:03:25.478 align:start position:0%
I see and again to get caught smoking in
 
07:03:27.750 --> 07:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
public is extremely difficult especially
 
07:03:29.230 --> 07:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
unless you don't you literally just go
 
07:03:30.868 --> 07:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
out of your way and smoke freely like
 
07:03:36.150 --> 07:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal ice okay
 
07:03:40.548 --> 07:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
um well anyway all right um the Edibles
 
07:03:43.910 --> 07:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
do not appear to be
 
07:03:47.270 --> 07:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
candy I I believe that is in in the um
 
07:03:48.750 --> 07:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
draft that I it was hand out to the
 
07:03:51.030 --> 07:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee today so so he should tell the
 
07:03:52.990 --> 07:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission about this right those
 
07:03:56.430 --> 07:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
those liquor filled candy
 
07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
canes you know the comparison to liquor
 
07:04:01.430 --> 07:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
I understand there's also there's an
 
07:04:03.270 --> 07:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
except cep of liquor because it's been
 
07:04:06.670 --> 07:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
legal for 90 years so the societ going
 
07:04:08.430 --> 07:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
to people who have been adly against
 
07:04:11.868 --> 07:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis and presenting this to them I I
 
07:04:13.708 --> 07:04:13.718 align:start position:0%
I really think I understand some of us
 
07:04:15.868 --> 07:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
are all willing to vote for virtually
 
07:04:17.350 --> 07:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
any cannabis bill there's people like me
 
07:04:19.110 --> 07:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
who are you should call a Swing Vote and
 
07:04:20.670 --> 07:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
then some will vote against no matter
 
07:04:23.150 --> 07:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
what it is you don't see that debate
 
07:04:24.590 --> 07:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
with alcohol so the comparison to
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol I keep hearing it I think it's
 
07:04:30.350 --> 07:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
not not the best way to go about things
 
07:04:32.190 --> 07:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
07:04:36.070 --> 07:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
no more than 15 stores right that that's
 
07:04:38.548 --> 07:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
very clearly spelled out retailers to
 
07:04:42.270 --> 07:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
consult The Liquor Commission on Final
 
07:04:46.030 --> 07:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
price it it the way I have it drafted is
 
07:04:48.468 --> 07:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
that liquor ultimate control the price
 
07:04:51.750 --> 07:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
is to basically prevent the market
 
07:04:53.990 --> 07:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
manipulation from happening in someone
 
07:04:56.788 --> 07:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
going up under as a result someone
 
07:04:58.388 --> 07:04:58.398 align:start position:0%
operates at a loss for a very long time
 
07:04:59.750 --> 07:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
because when that you have that over
 
07:05:02.708 --> 07:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
Supply what's being sold for $150 or
 
07:05:04.750 --> 07:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
$200 or whatever it is all of a sudden
 
07:05:06.150 --> 07:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's $30 or
 
07:05:08.430 --> 07:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
$50 and not everyone's going to be able
 
07:05:09.948 --> 07:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
to survive that what do you do about
 
07:05:11.830 --> 07:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not sure why that's been
 
07:05:12.910 --> 07:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
happening in other the states it doesn't
 
07:05:15.430 --> 07:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
seem like a good idea so the idea was if
 
07:05:17.110 --> 07:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
that happened you can they can step in
 
07:05:20.310 --> 07:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
and stop it and again that's to protect
 
07:05:20.320 --> 07:05:22.868 align:start position:0%
and stop it and again that's to protect
the

07:05:22.868 --> 07:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:05:26.350 --> 07:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
franchisee um no more than one road mile
 
07:05:26.360 --> 07:05:27.310 align:start position:0%
franchisee um no more than one road mile
from

07:05:27.310 --> 07:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:05:30.628 --> 07:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
schools if it's a city or town under
 
07:05:36.388 --> 07:05:36.398 align:start position:0%
50,000 um and half mile if it's over
 
07:05:39.230 --> 07:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
50,000 that is in there and that is that
 
07:05:43.388 --> 07:05:43.398 align:start position:0%
is part of the compromise okay um that
 
07:05:44.628 --> 07:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission would have the
 
07:05:46.350 --> 07:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
final say on
 
07:05:49.990 --> 07:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
locations yes and keep in mind too
 
07:05:52.388 --> 07:05:52.398 align:start position:0%
that's that's very common when it comes
 
07:05:53.868 --> 07:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
to approving a
 
07:05:56.150 --> 07:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
franchise the franchisor likes to know
 
07:05:59.270 --> 07:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
where you're going to put the store sure
 
07:06:00.788 --> 07:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission would do all
 
07:06:00.798 --> 07:06:02.628 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission would do all
advertising

07:06:02.628 --> 07:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
07:06:04.468 --> 07:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
to the extent that any advertising would
 
07:06:08.030 --> 07:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
be permitted uh I understand that the
 
07:06:11.270 --> 07:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
Commerce version has no advertising
 
07:06:14.548 --> 07:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
period uh there is advertising is
 
07:06:16.388 --> 07:06:16.398 align:start position:0%
extremely limited no Billboards no
 
07:06:19.430 --> 07:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
mailings no TV commercials but to have
 
07:06:21.270 --> 07:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
zero advertising we kind of left it open
 
07:06:23.468 --> 07:06:23.478 align:start position:0%
to maybe have stuff inside perhaps the
 
07:06:25.590 --> 07:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
state liquor store so we want to have
 
07:06:27.868 --> 07:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
maybe some promotional but when I say
 
07:06:30.190 --> 07:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
limited but whatever that is it would be
 
07:06:32.388 --> 07:06:32.398 align:start position:0%
performed by The Liquor Commission
 
07:06:35.670 --> 07:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
not the individual franchisee and but of
 
07:06:37.468 --> 07:06:37.478 align:start position:0%
course any franchisee would benefit from
 
07:06:37.478 --> 07:06:38.468 align:start position:0%
course any franchisee would benefit from
that

07:06:38.468 --> 07:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:06:41.350 --> 07:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
advertising no lobbying we've talked
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
about that one
 
07:06:45.430 --> 07:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's on the last page tucked away
 
07:06:46.910 --> 07:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
but so I don't want to think I tried to
 
07:06:51.030 --> 07:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
hide it yeah okay that um the product is
 
07:06:54.350 --> 07:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
tested for potency so I guess maybe some
 
07:06:59.110 --> 07:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
kind of standards of potency yeah so I
 
07:07:01.230 --> 07:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
believe both both versions have have
 
07:07:04.388 --> 07:07:04.398 align:start position:0%
that we were big on having private the
 
07:07:06.350 --> 07:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
testing be done by a private company and
 
07:07:08.070 --> 07:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for that when it comes to
 
07:07:09.788 --> 07:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
dealing with narcotics or other control
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
drugs our state lab are you know they're
 
07:07:14.388 --> 07:07:14.398 align:start position:0%
behind schedule when it comes to testing
 
07:07:15.910 --> 07:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
on criminal prosecutions I'm talking
 
07:07:18.310 --> 07:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and those those cases you so
 
07:07:20.430 --> 07:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
you don't really want to get that mixed
 
07:07:22.670 --> 07:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
up and mess with that because someone
 
07:07:24.628 --> 07:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
who's uh representing people charged
 
07:07:26.708 --> 07:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
with offenses you can uh beat a case if
 
07:07:29.830 --> 07:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
you don't if the state doesn't hurry up
 
07:07:31.990 --> 07:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to cause a un intended
 
07:07:35.150 --> 07:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
consequence sure and the franchise fee
 
07:07:37.910 --> 07:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
being something between 10 and
 
07:07:41.548 --> 07:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
15% I what's in what's in what I
 
07:07:43.388 --> 07:07:43.398 align:start position:0%
provided or was provided today is 12 and
 
07:07:46.110 --> 07:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
a half understand that when this
 
07:07:48.190 --> 07:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
franchise model was first presented in
 
07:07:48.200 --> 07:07:49.030 align:start position:0%
franchise model was first presented in
the

07:07:49.030 --> 07:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:07:51.510 --> 07:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
commission the number was 15 but it was
 
07:07:53.070 --> 07:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't really discuss that we figured
 
07:07:54.350 --> 07:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a
 
07:07:57.150 --> 07:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
great assignment for Ways and Means or
 
07:07:59.150 --> 07:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
Finance but we just we were focusing
 
07:08:01.548 --> 07:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
more on just putting the model together
 
07:08:03.388 --> 07:08:03.398 align:start position:0%
so it really hasn't been a discussion on
 
07:08:05.910 --> 07:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
what it should be um I know that the
 
07:08:08.948 --> 07:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
commer version lowered it to 10 but
 
07:08:11.030 --> 07:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
again I I'm not sure that there was
 
07:08:13.868 --> 07:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
really what went into that I will say by
 
07:08:15.548 --> 07:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
including the therapeutic products as
 
07:08:18.510 --> 07:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
part of the the fee it is justifiable to
 
07:08:20.388 --> 07:08:20.398 align:start position:0%
maybe lower it from 15 to 12 and a half
 
07:08:22.030 --> 07:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
I kind of looked at that as a 15 20%
 
07:08:23.990 --> 07:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
market share that's where it kind of 12
 
07:08:25.830 --> 07:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
and a half came into play but the lower
 
07:08:27.708 --> 07:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
you make that you know I support that
 
07:08:29.190 --> 07:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be a justification
 
07:08:30.430 --> 07:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
for an
 
07:08:31.990 --> 07:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
explanation I mean it needs to be
 
07:08:34.510 --> 07:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
studied so if it should be lowered I
 
07:08:36.708 --> 07:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
would hope uh there would be some reason
 
07:08:38.628 --> 07:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
why all right so now let's talk so
 
07:08:41.270 --> 07:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's my whole list here so let's talk
 
07:08:43.510 --> 07:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
about so all that's in here right that
 
07:08:46.830 --> 07:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like yeah okay it's it's in there
 
07:08:48.628 --> 07:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
I hope everyone likes it all right I
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand let's talk about money um
 
07:08:54.910 --> 07:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
because what's not on this list is my
 
07:08:58.670 --> 07:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
main issue which is all the automatic
 
07:09:01.948 --> 07:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
spending right there's there's most of
 
07:09:04.270 --> 07:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
it goes to education but then there's
 
07:09:06.670 --> 07:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
10% for the drug and
 
07:09:10.708 --> 07:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse thing there's 5% for this
 
07:09:14.590 --> 07:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's you know Etc
 
07:09:17.788 --> 07:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
um and I hate all that automatic
 
07:09:20.750 --> 07:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
spending I think as a finance committee
 
07:09:22.670 --> 07:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
we should decide what our spending is
 
07:09:26.150 --> 07:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to be every every two years right
 
07:09:29.430 --> 07:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
and um and we rightsize all of these
 
07:09:30.948 --> 07:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
different things and we trade them off
 
07:09:33.150 --> 07:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
against each other and so on but when
 
07:09:35.388 --> 07:09:35.398 align:start position:0%
you put in when you put in automatic
 
07:09:38.670 --> 07:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
numbers like are in all of these bills
 
07:09:41.270 --> 07:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
then that becomes the base for people
 
07:09:45.070 --> 07:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
who receive that money and they think
 
07:09:46.990 --> 07:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know if we ever cut it which we can
 
07:09:48.910 --> 07:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
do in house bill to right in House Bill
 
07:09:49.990 --> 07:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
two we can always say well
 
07:09:53.070 --> 07:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA one whatever you
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
know we'll make it the you know you
 
07:09:57.590 --> 07:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't get your 10% you get a million or
 
07:10:01.350 --> 07:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you get but um all those people
 
07:10:04.310 --> 07:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
people start to whine and say wait a
 
07:10:07.388 --> 07:10:07.398 align:start position:0%
minute you're not fully funding me you
 
07:10:10.030 --> 07:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
know because I supposed to get 10% you
 
07:10:13.868 --> 07:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
know and um and so I'd like to avoid all
 
07:10:15.990 --> 07:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
that stuff and just say you know
 
07:10:18.030 --> 07:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
personally I'd like to say 100% goes to
 
07:10:20.430 --> 07:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
education or something like that right
 
07:10:23.670 --> 07:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
so so first of all the future legislator
 
07:10:25.868 --> 07:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
can do make all the changes they want so
 
07:10:27.270 --> 07:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
whatever's in here and they change it
 
07:10:30.830 --> 07:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's what it is um I'm
 
07:10:34.110 --> 07:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
glad you brought the funding issue I one
 
07:10:35.388 --> 07:10:35.398 align:start position:0%
there's some talk about the governor's
 
07:10:38.788 --> 07:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
Commission on alcohol and then there's
 
07:10:40.110 --> 07:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
this this creates another commission
 
07:10:41.670 --> 07:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
where it's um the substance abuse I'm
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
not sure if I'm titling those correctly
 
07:10:43.910 --> 07:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
but it's right at the beginning on page
 
07:10:46.510 --> 07:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
two one and two um there's some thought
 
07:10:49.230 --> 07:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
that you really don't need to have those
 
07:10:51.548 --> 07:10:51.558 align:start position:0%
separated the commission the Attorney
 
07:10:52.990 --> 07:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
General recommended doing that simply
 
07:10:55.030 --> 07:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
not to mix the funds together I that's
 
07:10:57.190 --> 07:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
not a deal breaker for anyone that I can
 
07:10:59.868 --> 07:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
understand it would be less government
 
07:11:02.030 --> 07:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
operates if you just had one fund now
 
07:11:05.150 --> 07:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh what I presented
 
07:11:08.868 --> 07:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
75% it it would offset the liability for
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property
 
07:11:14.830 --> 07:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
tax um that's 75% of it 10% would go to
 
07:11:16.350 --> 07:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
the substance use prevention treatment
 
07:11:18.708 --> 07:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
and Recovery Fund that's obviously the
 
07:11:21.948 --> 07:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
fund that could just be become the join
 
07:11:24.430 --> 07:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission 5% be
 
07:11:28.468 --> 07:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:31.590 --> 07:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
agencies and 5% shall be dis spers to
 
07:11:33.948 --> 07:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of uh DHHS for services
 
07:11:36.388 --> 07:11:36.398 align:start position:0%
for behavioral behavioral health there's
 
07:11:38.388 --> 07:11:38.398 align:start position:0%
even some overlap there where um you
 
07:11:39.548 --> 07:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
know the govern's commission does some
 
07:11:42.948 --> 07:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
of that already so again hence why I
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
value the input from a finance committee
 
07:11:46.910 --> 07:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
on a bill that has a good chance of
 
07:11:50.590 --> 07:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
making over the finish line so I support
 
07:11:52.150 --> 07:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
that if you want to put more into the
 
07:11:55.230 --> 07:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
swept I'm certainly not going to make a
 
07:11:57.070 --> 07:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
make any well I'm asking the question a
 
07:11:59.430 --> 07:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
slightly different way does any of your
 
07:12:05.830 --> 07:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
14 votes depend on HHS getting this or
 
07:12:07.190 --> 07:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:12:09.548 --> 07:12:09.558 align:start position:0%
whatever well getting that you see what
 
07:12:11.670 --> 07:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I haven't pulled that exact
 
07:12:14.670 --> 07:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
question but I will say one of the I I
 
07:12:16.628 --> 07:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
did skip over the the provision
 
07:12:18.548 --> 07:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
involving some of the legal aid
 
07:12:22.030 --> 07:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
issues and I know there was a social
 
07:12:23.910 --> 07:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
justice Fund in here that had some very
 
07:12:26.430 --> 07:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
vague undefined terms and I'm trying to
 
07:12:27.788 --> 07:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
figure out where exactly would this be
 
07:12:29.510 --> 07:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
used and how would that be used and what
 
07:12:31.548 --> 07:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
communities does it go to we we have
 
07:12:33.708 --> 07:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
artificial undefined terms describing
 
07:12:35.468 --> 07:12:35.478 align:start position:0%
communities that I don't even know where
 
07:12:37.430 --> 07:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
to begin with that that's that's a long
 
07:12:39.388 --> 07:12:39.398 align:start position:0%
conversation for another day the
 
07:12:41.868 --> 07:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
compromise with that to take that out
 
07:12:43.910 --> 07:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
was the
 
07:12:48.030 --> 07:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
um some of the money for the um legal
 
07:12:51.388 --> 07:12:51.398 align:start position:0%
aid I think that that's that's
 
07:12:54.270 --> 07:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
helpful so I would recommend you know
 
07:12:57.150 --> 07:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps keeping that in there okay uh
 
07:12:58.510 --> 07:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
some people may get upset and go back to
 
07:13:00.670 --> 07:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
the social justice fund yeah I I the
 
07:13:02.990 --> 07:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
name sounds great but the application
 
07:13:05.628 --> 07:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really line up with any
 
07:13:07.590 --> 07:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
other legal terms that work under
 
07:13:11.190 --> 07:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
statute anywhere else thank
 
07:13:14.708 --> 07:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:17.750 --> 07:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions sorry no no go ahead I thought
 
07:13:20.708 --> 07:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
you were going to wrap it up no um when
 
07:13:23.030 --> 07:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was going through
 
07:13:25.430 --> 07:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the governor's requirements he talked
 
07:13:28.070 --> 07:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
about um public
 
07:13:30.468 --> 07:13:30.478 align:start position:0%
smoking uh I'm not sure he had an
 
07:13:32.468 --> 07:13:32.478 align:start position:0%
opinion on the misdemeanor
 
07:13:35.150 --> 07:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
classification do want to do your votes
 
07:13:37.788 --> 07:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
rise and fall on your classification of
 
07:13:40.910 --> 07:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor for second and third
 
07:13:45.030 --> 07:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:47.910 --> 07:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
do and and when I say that I I hear a
 
07:13:50.310 --> 07:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
lot about what everyone's talking about
 
07:13:52.070 --> 07:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
would get signed to law remember it has
 
07:13:54.510 --> 07:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
to make it to his desk and if it doesn't
 
07:13:56.230 --> 07:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
make it to the Des his desk then it's
 
07:13:58.430 --> 07:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
all it's not going to matter I know if
 
07:14:00.230 --> 07:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
you left that a violation you're
 
07:14:02.468 --> 07:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
definitely going to lose my vot making
 
07:14:05.150 --> 07:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
it a second offense that puts into a
 
07:14:07.468 --> 07:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I what I wanted was the
 
07:14:10.310 --> 07:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
first offense and if you listen to the
 
07:14:11.868 --> 07:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
debate in the commission it was about an
 
07:14:14.270 --> 07:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
hour long about just arguing back and
 
07:14:17.948 --> 07:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
forth so after that that is a compromise
 
07:14:21.030 --> 07:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
so I think that's pretty reasonable
 
07:14:23.548 --> 07:14:23.558 align:start position:0%
because it's like I said whoever is
 
07:14:26.948 --> 07:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
smoking cannabis in public I assume they
 
07:14:29.230 --> 07:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
know it's illegal when they're doing it
 
07:14:31.030 --> 07:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it to the point that
 
07:14:33.190 --> 07:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it's so egregious
 
07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I had family members in New York
 
07:14:37.310 --> 07:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
City this past weekend they were
 
07:14:38.388 --> 07:14:38.398 align:start position:0%
complaining all you can do is smell
 
07:14:40.590 --> 07:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis my family we go to Old Orchard
 
07:14:42.230 --> 07:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
Beach every summer I'm pushing a
 
07:14:43.990 --> 07:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
stroller and all I can do is smell
 
07:14:46.230 --> 07:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis I had was in Salem
 
07:14:47.788 --> 07:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts going going to a
 
07:14:49.750 --> 07:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
courthouse in the parking garage about
 
07:14:51.628 --> 07:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
8:30 in the morning going down the
 
07:14:53.150 --> 07:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
stairway trying to the elevator is a
 
07:14:55.468 --> 07:14:55.478 align:start position:0%
little slow in that parking garage the
 
07:14:57.590 --> 07:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
whole thing is and I'm worried now I'm
 
07:14:58.750 --> 07:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to smell like this walking into a
 
07:15:01.150 --> 07:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
courthouse so everywhere every state
 
07:15:03.468 --> 07:15:03.478 align:start position:0%
that has legalized it it is people
 
07:15:05.750 --> 07:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
walking down the street smoking it and
 
07:15:07.708 --> 07:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
it's without consequence violation
 
07:15:11.868 --> 07:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
offenses are really something that's I
 
07:15:14.788 --> 07:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
yes it's a crime but the enforceability
 
07:15:17.110 --> 07:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
has to make sense too there is is it
 
07:15:19.270 --> 07:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
viable to enforce these penalties if
 
07:15:20.708 --> 07:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to just be a violation
 
07:15:20.718 --> 07:15:22.270 align:start position:0%
it's going to just be a violation
violation

07:15:22.270 --> 07:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
violation
 
07:15:24.750 --> 07:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
violation what are we doing and then
 
07:15:24.760 --> 07:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
violation what are we doing and then
repeat

07:15:25.830 --> 07:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
07:15:29.910 --> 07:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:29.920 --> 07:15:32.708 align:start position:0%
 
time

07:15:32.708 --> 07:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:15:34.628 --> 07:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
so I I was looking for the fiscal note
 
07:15:37.230 --> 07:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity and I see it's about
 
07:15:40.230 --> 07:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
$18.2 million for the first two years
 
07:15:42.430 --> 07:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's identical to what was in the
 
07:15:45.948 --> 07:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
Cannabis report I guess on page 42 in
 
07:15:49.548 --> 07:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
your 37 so I guess those numbers we know
 
07:15:52.350 --> 07:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
it's about double what the uh Commerce
 
07:15:55.110 --> 07:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
Commission or Commerce committee's uh
 
07:15:58.110 --> 07:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was I I haven't done a side
 
07:15:59.750 --> 07:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
by side of that there was some talk
 
07:16:02.548 --> 07:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
about where that funding would come from
 
07:16:04.628 --> 07:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
and I was speaking with one of my
 
07:16:07.230 --> 07:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the Senate and it was the
 
07:16:08.990 --> 07:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
thought was could it come from the
 
07:16:11.430 --> 07:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
liquor fund versus the general fund
 
07:16:13.190 --> 07:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
again that's something I think would be
 
07:16:15.750 --> 07:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
best I would refer to this committee
 
07:16:17.708 --> 07:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
what I would say that if is any money
 
07:16:19.430 --> 07:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
taken out of the general fund I did put
 
07:16:21.310 --> 07:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
a provision in here that that money
 
07:16:23.910 --> 07:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
would be paid back uh by whatever
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue once it's once it's made I think
 
07:16:29.190 --> 07:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to return that to the
 
07:16:30.670 --> 07:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
general fund it may not be in the first
 
07:16:32.750 --> 07:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
year or two but if they do draw 18
 
07:16:34.910 --> 07:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
million it should be paid back with with
 
07:16:36.990 --> 07:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue yeah some of us have talked
 
07:16:38.388 --> 07:16:38.398 align:start position:0%
about it whether it should be liquor
 
07:16:40.590 --> 07:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
money or because it all goes to the same
 
07:16:43.110 --> 07:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
pot but because this is a little
 
07:16:45.430 --> 07:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
different maybe it should directly come
 
07:16:46.868 --> 07:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
from liquor and not come out of the
 
07:16:49.310 --> 07:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
general fund like $18.2 million out of
 
07:16:51.070 --> 07:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
the general fund maybe it should come
 
07:16:53.230 --> 07:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
out of liquor which would lessen what
 
07:16:54.750 --> 07:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
comes back to the general fund but it's
 
07:16:56.510 --> 07:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
that mixing of the money so maybe it
 
07:16:58.468 --> 07:16:58.478 align:start position:0%
should come out of liquor initially and
 
07:16:59.670 --> 07:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't believe that's a deal
 
07:17:01.708 --> 07:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
breaker with anyone so that's and again
 
07:17:03.230 --> 07:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I value the input of a
 
07:17:05.190 --> 07:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee looking at this I've
 
07:17:06.868 --> 07:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
never sat on a finance committee as
 
07:17:08.628 --> 07:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
member of the house so right remember
 
07:17:10.388 --> 07:17:10.398 align:start position:0%
you a good chair of Criminal Justice
 
07:17:12.468 --> 07:17:12.478 align:start position:0%
though in the old days I appreciate the
 
07:17:14.708 --> 07:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
kind words no thanks so much uh
 
07:17:16.430 --> 07:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative sweet
 
07:17:18.510 --> 07:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:17:21.230 --> 07:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
senator for being here just to summarize
 
07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
this compromised package can get at
 
07:17:25.590 --> 07:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
least 13 votes in the senate in your
 
07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and get to someone important St
 
07:17:31.990 --> 07:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
by my count it's more than 13
 
07:17:34.388 --> 07:17:34.398 align:start position:0%
but the other one I think I I believe
 
07:17:37.590 --> 07:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
the count is 10 I I again that's that's
 
07:17:38.948 --> 07:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
when I last did that was about a month
 
07:17:41.310 --> 07:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
ago so thank
 
07:17:43.670 --> 07:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
you again great to see you and thank you
 
07:17:45.388 --> 07:17:45.398 align:start position:0%
and we'll be meeting next week the time
 
07:17:47.310 --> 07:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
will be in the calendar but we'll look
 
07:17:51.948 --> 07:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:54.548 --> 07:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
you all right at that we'll wrap this up
 
07:17:56.388 --> 07:17:56.398 align:start position:0%
and we again we'll meet on this everyone
 
07:17:58.430 --> 07:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
will have a chance to look at the new
 
07:18:00.590 --> 07:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we'll discuss it I happen
 
07:18:04.990 --> 07:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
to have uh four more copies Oh I thought
 
07:18:06.670 --> 07:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire will probably
 
07:18:08.910 --> 07:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
have an amendment for us next
 
07:18:29.708 --> 07:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:29.718 --> 07:18:59.708 align:start position:0%
 
have

07:18:59.708 --> 07:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:59.718 --> 07:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
