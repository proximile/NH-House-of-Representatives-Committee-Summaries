00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
26.
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses the disposition of
 
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
assets and liabilities and equity in
 
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District Holdings as
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
it pertains to withdrawal from a
 
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.689 align:start position:0%
it pertains to withdrawal from a
dissolution

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from or a dissolution of a
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District the need for
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
this bill has been expressed to
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
legislators in my district for many many
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
years by numerous constituents
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addresses is as
 
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.529 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addresses is as
follows

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
follows
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
under current statute when either a
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District withdraws
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
from a co-op or a Cooperative school
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
district is dissolved the pre-existing
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
School District forfeits all equity in
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
Co-op facilities that are not located in
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
the town of the pre-existing School
 
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:26.930 align:start position:0%
the town of the pre-existing School
District

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
in other words the withdrawing
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District receives no
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
compensation for the money it
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
contributed in the co-op schools located
 
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 align:start position:0%
in other towns
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
consequently such pre-existing school
 
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.909 align:start position:0%
consequently such pre-existing school
districts

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
that have invested taxpayer dollars over
 
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:50.660 align:start position:0%
the course of years in other towns are a
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
severe disadvantage if they desire to
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
leave the co-op
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
as such they unfairly face a tremendous
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
Financial penalty to withdraw from the
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
co-op due to the mere fact that Co-op
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
facilities are happen to be located in
 
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.300 align:start position:0%
another town
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly this is both unjust and
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and it needs to be remedied
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
to amend the current Statute in order to
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
provide that pre-existing school
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
districts without Co-op School District
 
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.500 align:start position:0%
facilities in their Town receive
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
Equitable share of fair market value
 
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.889 align:start position:0%
Equitable share of fair market value
proportional

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
to their investments in those facilities
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
notably this bill provides that fair
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
market value will be number one
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
determined by an independent committee
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Department of Education
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
and by the Department of Revenue
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
administration number two
 
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:02.660 align:start position:0%
approved by the State Board of Education
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
number three clearly stipulated in the
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or dissolution plan and
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
number four available to all voters
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
before a final vote is taken to act on
 
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal or the dissolution
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
so at this point I'd like to speak to my
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
handout if the chair would allow yes
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
this is a complex bill so therefore I
 
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100 align:start position:0%
felt that some graphic illustrations
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
would lend to
 
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.030 align:start position:0%
would lend to
um

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
I guess describing what's going on here
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
and what this bill proposes so on the
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
first page I have an example of a
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
two-town co-op
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
so as you can see on the left the pie
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
chart there
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
depicts investments in buildings land
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
and Facilities that are located in town
 
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.009 align:start position:0%
and Facilities that are located in town
a

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
and they are combined
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
the investment is 10 million dollars
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
under the current statute if town or
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District a initiates
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
a dissolution
 
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:16.580 align:start position:0%
and the equity is
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
determined to be 30 million dollars then
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
a pays B four million dollars its
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
initial investment
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
however if a initiates a dissolution
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
then under current statute as you can
 
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
see to the to the right same you know
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
obviously same three million dollar
 
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
obviously same three million dollar
equity

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
if B initiates dissolution
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
then a pays B zero nothing
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
so what this bill proposes is for the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
same scenario if either A or B initiates
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
a dissolution
 
00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:59.449 align:start position:0%
a dissolution
then

00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
a pays B 12 million dollars and that is
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
proportional to the equity I mean
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
proportional to what was invested in the
 
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
co-op facilities
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
so on the following page I have an
 
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
example over three Town Co-op and I'll
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
just run through this it's it's this
 
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
follows the same logic
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
we have um three towns the investment in
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
buildings land of facilities are happen
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
to be located in town a valued at 11 you
 
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
know million dollars was a total
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
investment if a initiates the
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
dissolution then a pays B the three
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a pay C two million
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
dollars however under current RSA is B
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
initiates the withdrawal
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
and the equity is determined to be 33
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars then both A and C pay B
 
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.370 align:start position:0%
million dollars then both A and C pay B
zero

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
and what the this um House Bill 1399
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
proposes to um
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
to amend is that for the obviously the
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
same scenario of the three-town district
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
if a initiates a dissolution then a will
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
pay B 9 million and a will pay C 6
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
million and finally
 
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
million and finally
um

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposes that
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
if B initiates a withdrawal then A and C
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
become the new co-op and together they
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill addresses the
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
unfair and unjust penalties in current
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
statute against pre-existing school
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
districts that want to withdraw from a
 
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.110 align:start position:0%
districts that want to withdraw from a
co-op

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
and it levels the playing field by
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all pre-existing school
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
districts in a co-op receive their
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
Equitable share of fair market value
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
that concludes my bill introduction and
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm happy to answer any
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions if you allow thank you very
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
much are there uh folks on the committee
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
that like to ask questions represent a
 
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
that like to ask questions represent a
boom

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
boom
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
represent Powell for taking the question
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the problems we've always had
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
in the past is
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
every Association Co-op Association has
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
different rules
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh and that's one of the problems we've
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
had in the past is there anything in the
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason thing that
 
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.710 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason thing that
gives

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.100 align:start position:0%
covers this or where is the school
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative you referenced
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
a term rules and I'm assuming that that
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps you're referring to the articles
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
of agreement for the co-op
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
and could you restate the question
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah every Co-op has an articles of
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
agreement like you said and and and one
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
of the problems we've had in the past is
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
every Co-op has different articles of
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
agreement which makes these kind of law
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
rules bills difficult so is there
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
anything in your articles of agreement
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
that covers this and in the case of
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
where where is the school located okay
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
so my my understanding is you know the
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement serve as the
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
constitution of the co-op and clearly
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to the dissolution or
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
withdrawal that these types of issues
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
are addressed in statute so then
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
therefore we would refer to rsas in
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you know guide or inform us as to how
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to handle this I think I
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a two part I'm not familiar
 
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.829 align:start position:0%
think it's a two part I'm not familiar
with

00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
each and every co-op in the state of New
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what there are articles of
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
agreement stipulate but of course you
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
would have to you know look at those and
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
in concert with statute and I I hope
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
that I clearly Illustrated that the way
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
that the current statute is and I
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
believe that it was um it was adopted
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
and signed into law into 1977. this is
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very complex abstract
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know scenario that legislators
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
attempted to address
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
in in in in statute
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
and upon you know close inspection of of
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
this this section of law
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know they did the best that they
 
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
you know they did the best that they
could

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I feel that today you know we can do
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
better because clearly the way that the
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
law is is written is it's just it's
 
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.750 align:start position:0%
law is is written is it's just it's
unfair

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
and it makes no sense that I would like
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
in the situation of a you know
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or a dissolution uh like any
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
other legal
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
relationship or contract like a marriage
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
if one party you know decides that the
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
relationship is not working out and
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
they've invested you know financially
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
in assets the notion that because they
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
want to leave that relationship and they
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
get nothing is not fair
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
oh you had your hand up first it doesn't
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
matter go ahead Mary Beth that's fine oh
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate it
 
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.150 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate it
uh

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
just a I'm following your chart
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I understand the a
 
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.689 align:start position:0%
um I understand the a
h

00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
if a is where the if I get this right a
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
is where the buildings are located
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
correct it's our facility for instance
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we're leaving
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
right so we have to pay you we're
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
leaving and we are we we own the
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
facility is that right
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
a is the town in which the co-op
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are located and so under
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
current statute yes a pays B the the
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
initial investment and it does not take
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
into account any appreciation okay the
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
fair market value that's not my question
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
okay the question is okay so on the
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
leaving the co-op
 
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.890 align:start position:0%
leaving the co-op
under

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
the plate why I don't understand why
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
they would get paid they the facility is
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
there they have made the choice to leave
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.090 align:start position:0%
Okay so
leave

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
if you choose to leave we know we now
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
have the people left in the co-op have
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
to figure out absorb the extra costs and
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
the facilities there I don't understand
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
if if B leaves first why why they should
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
get paid I understand I understand if
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the school is housing all the work
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
leaves then you left those two at risk
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
and yes you should pay for that facility
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
but if it's if the B decides to leave
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
um on the wrong why why would you do
 
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.650 align:start position:0%
um on the wrong why why would you do
that

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
because the the co-op is is an agreement
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
in which like for example in this
 
00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:17.299 align:start position:0%
two-town Co-op both towns have invested
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
in that Co-op and have
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
ex raised and appropriated taxpayer
 
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.370 align:start position:0%
ex raised and appropriated taxpayer
dollars

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
to to fund
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know land buildings and Facilities
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
and so they have the the town B has you
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
know a bona fide
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know interest in they've paid all
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
along so just because facilities happen
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
to be located in not their town
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's unfair that they would end up
 
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you okay just my own
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
last one so going back to the same
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
scenario when this two turns out is B
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
all the time that B has been a partner
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
with a in this facility they've been
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to use their investment
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it's out there they're getting the
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
money thing stolen or are they I
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
understand the loss of my investment but
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
that was my choice I've been using it
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
for 10 years we don't want it anymore
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're leaving
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
as a school district
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay so I would I would respectfully ask
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that perhaps you you think of this
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
scenario from a different different
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
reference point and that would be that
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
town a
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
in which the co-op facilities are
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
located they have the the benefit of
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
moving forward with all those assets
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
they did not pay raise and appropriate
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars exclusively in their
 
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.730 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars exclusively in their
town

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
tax monies were raised in Pro and
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated in both towns so again I
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
would I would I would you know reiterate
 
00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:03.289 align:start position:0%
would I would I would you know reiterate
that

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
for town a to move forward and walk you
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
know forward
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
with assets
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
that they did not exclusively pay for it
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
yet it was paid for jointly
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
to me is is unfair and I feel strongly
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we as legislators can do better for
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
the people the taxpayers of New
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's that's why I've
 
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.049 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's that's why I've
proposed

00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.789 align:start position:0%
proposed
representative

00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so one of the first lessons we
 
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
learn as legislators is be aware of
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and what I see
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
before me is kind of a one-size-fits-all
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that probably Cooperative
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
districts around the state have a lot of
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
different arrangements and a lot of
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
different ways as to where they got to
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
where they are and it's not I'm sure
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
always that they jointly built a
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
building and as representative Woodcock
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
said you know they have gotten the
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
benefit of that along the way say that
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
building is now 30 or 40 years old what
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
about the depreciation on that building
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
if if building is in uh District a and
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
they are holding the building so my my
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
concern is is that we have something
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
that is fair maybe perhaps more fair in
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
some districts but less fair in others
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
so with that as a basis I'm asking you
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
to what extent have you looked at the
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts around the state
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
to know that they're all in the same
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
situation and they all have the same
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
investment in buildings and the
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
buildings are all still not basically
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
depreciated up because they've gotten so
 
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.430 align:start position:0%
depreciated up because they've gotten so
old

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
I the important thing to understand with
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
with this um bill is that it all hinges
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
on fair market value and that will be
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
assessed by a committee appointed by the
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and the depart
 
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:01.820 align:start position:0%
dra Department of and revenue
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
Administration and so there will be a
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee that is formed to
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
um to assess the fair market value
 
00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
um to assess the fair market value
and

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's an independent committee and that
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
there will be you know many
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the stakeholders to
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
provide you know input and again I would
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
I would would reiterate that this all is
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
about the fair market value
 
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.250 align:start position:0%
about the fair market value
so

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I have a question and that is do we
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
know that in every Cooperative districts
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
all districts contributed to the
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
construction of the building and it's
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
not that they form the co-op after the
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
building was built because if only one
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
District contributed to the construction
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
of the building and we put this in law
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
as a fixed solution then I think it
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
could create an inequity in the case of
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
if one District built one of the
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
buildings initially thank you for the
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
to be clear again the the crafting and
 
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:05.419 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
addresses that the the payout
 
00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:14.539 align:start position:0%
is proportional to what a town
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
contributed along the way so that is a
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
that's a factor and yes that would be
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
taken into account therefore if a town
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
didn't contribute or you know
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
contributed at some percentage the pay
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
the payout
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
after the dissolution or withdrawal
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
would be proportional to what was paid
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
in and I I feel that that is clearly
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm going to ask
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
you a question right now seeing that we
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
have dealt with the cooperative
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
School District issue for years and
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
years and we've gone to the point where
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
in previous years we've gathered in
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
these agreements and looked at the
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
agreements which are all based upon
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
different percentages of different
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
elements be it value of property via
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment be it poverty Etc
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
um my concern is if District a
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
has the facility within it
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
and we'll just take a a two District
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
Co-op and District B
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
is a small District but District a wants
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
to go It Alone
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
now this District B is located in the
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
part of this state where there's no
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
other options available I know if you're
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
a k through eight school if you become a
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
k through eight you have the option to
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
tuition your students out but if there's
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
no place a tuition students out where
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
does District B in this process end up
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
with their students is there a
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
transition plan where we can ensure that
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
no student is Left Behind
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
my understanding with regard to the
 
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
my understanding with regard to the
process

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:00.740 align:start position:0%
of withdrawal or dissolution is that a
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
proposal will be crafted by stakeholders
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
with voters
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
input you know at you know
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
and hearings and that that withdrawal
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
plan shall be and submitted to the
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and it will it
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved and then sent back
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the district to the voters of
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
the district to to to vote up or down my
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
last follow-up is more of a concern uh
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
how does that impact District B which
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
has a minority of students in that
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
school district and the weighted vote is
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
always on the side of the larger
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:50.029 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
the focus of this bill was it was was
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know narrow and it had to do with
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
the unfairness in current statute you
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
know as I described with regard to a
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or or a dissolution that was
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
the focus of the bill
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
um these these other issues I I feel can
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
can be handled and and dealt with
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
of withdrawal thank you very much are
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
 
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
luno

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
luno
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
you very much for uh bringing this
 
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.850 align:start position:0%
you very much for uh bringing this
forward

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
um this morning and for taking my
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
question in the um in the in the
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
scenario uh proposed scenario on the
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
first page the a b scenario where's the
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
that for for the the payout yeah it
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
would come if it would prob it would
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
from from I mean let's just go with Town
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
so who's paying the bond
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
the tax it would have to be raised and
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the taxpayers
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
through taxation okay thank you

Lakers
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.610 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
have there been are you
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
have there been that you know of towns
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh Town bees
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
who wanted the solution for whatever
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
reasons and then didn't pursue it
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
because they got no money and they had
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
invested quite a bit that that's an
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
interesting and important question and
 
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:39.620 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
ask to defer that to an expert subject
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
matter witness who has signed up to to
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
speak they have direct experience with
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
with that in a co-op School District so
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
that individual is better suited to
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
speak to that thank you thank you are
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
 
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.850 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
Woodcock

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:00.860 align:start position:0%
Woodcock
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
yes you may I wrote the question down
 
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
but representative luno addressed it as
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
well as long clearing this so I'm in
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
town a where we have the facility
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
count D to my right here
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
wants to leave and your suggestion is
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
that we do the fair market value and
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
give it to her give that share to them
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
my question is is falling off of
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
Representative lunar that means my town
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
and our residents would have to be
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
re-taxed again
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
to pay them out so we're paying off the
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
bond we're paying for the the long-term
 
00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:36.539 align:start position:0%
maintenance facility which may be too
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
large what we need and now we have to
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
raise taxes again to pay them for
 
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
raise taxes again to pay them for
leaving

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that I just that's correct that's
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
what you're telling me thank you thank
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
you for the follow-up represent
 
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.350 align:start position:0%
you for the follow-up represent
representative

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
in mind as estimation and in my mind it
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
would be no different than any other
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the that the co-op would pursue
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
okay but that's that's how it would work
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
do you yes okay thank you thank you Mr
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
left further representative Porter
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and good to see you
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
again representative thank you um
 
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:19.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused here so Town B
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
contributed to the construction of the
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
elementary school now they want to leave
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
over the course of the 15 years they've
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
been paying taxes in to maintain the
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
roof to maintain the electricity to do
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
all those things to that building
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
um do they so they would according to
 
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.230 align:start position:0%
um do they so they would according to
your

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
your scenario here they would they
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
deserve to get some money back correct
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
because we're oh I'm sorry but what
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
Town B did not contribute to the
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
construction of the building but over
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
the years have been paying taxes to
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
maintain the building and now they want
 
00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:02.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
the the calculation is is clearly based
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
on what was invested so that all those
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
factors all those contributions would
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
have to you know be taken into account
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that it would be proportional to
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
that which the town paid in
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I feel that that that that that that
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
takes into account those factors
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
oh well yeah so that would mean that
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to go back over the
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
past 20 years or 10 years and look at
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
every time of a repair job was done
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
every time the building was re-roofed
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
whether the oil tanks were replaced
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
whether the heating oil prices went up
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things that have to go
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
back over the life of
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
the contract the the Cooper cooperative
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
and figure out what percentage of that
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
was paid by Town B and then what would
 
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
be the fair market value now and then
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
what would get paid out and who would do
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you for the
 
00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:11.870 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you for the
question

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you in a particular SAU who
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
would be assigned to do that research
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
but clearly the those those those types
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
of things are factors and and um
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
discovery that that would have to be you
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
know factored in to determining the fair
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
the next person to speak on this bill is
 
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
hello honorable members of the education
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Eric power I live
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
in Brookline New Hampshire
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I served as a school board member
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the Hollis Brookline Cooperative
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
school district for three years
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
and I do have direct experience with
 
00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:29.570 align:start position:0%
and I do have direct experience with
withdrawals

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
withdrawals
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and the question that was brought up
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
earlier but I wanted to mention a couple
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
of things being on the school board I'm
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the Articles of
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
agreement that are in the Hollis
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative School District
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
there is no uh provision in there it
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
says to follow RSA 195 essentially
 
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.529 align:start position:0%
says to follow RSA 195 essentially
um

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
in our case we're kind of town B and
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
Hollis is town a so they have the
 
00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:55.610 align:start position:0%
Hollis is town a so they have the
facilities

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.710 align:start position:0%
facilities
and

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
what happens in 2020 is we had an
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
article on the warrant to initiate a
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the Hollis Brookline
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
and there was much discussion about that
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
there was the the Brookline has grown a
 
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.250 align:start position:0%
there was the the Brookline has grown a
lot

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks in town think we've
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
outgrown the co-op it had worked well
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
but you know as we are considering
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
getting out but when this issue of
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
equity came up that we would lose
 
00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.149 align:start position:0%
equity came up that we would lose
everything

00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
that was seen as a showstopper to kind
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
of any other discussion and it was too
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
bad because we couldn't do anything the
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we've had is that
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
we've had majority votes Hollis has 60
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the voters they've changed
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
the apportionment formula probably the
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
most I think in the whole state six
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
times since the co-op was founded
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
they've done it every five years and
 
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
it's always and except for one case
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
always increase the taxes in Brookline
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
and decrease it in Hollis
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
so but there's other educational issues
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
that go along with that but that was
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
basically it no one wanted to go any
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
further because of the unfairness so
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we're looking
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh we do have an articles of agreement a
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
article to deal with grade reduction so
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
if we took a seventh and eighth grade
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
the co-op is a 7 through 12th Co-op if
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
we took seventh and eighth out we have a
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
we have agreements in there but right
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
now RSA 195 is the law RSA 195 27 and 28
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
is our one size fits all that we have
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
right now that's why we need to adjust
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
the one-size-fits all to be more fair so
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
that a small school district will be
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
able to get its fair share of equity
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
when the co-op decides that it's not
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
good for everyone and town a having
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
majority voters will have a big Say in
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
any plan so if they don't like the way
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
the plan's going they don't feel it's
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
fair they're going to vote no on it so
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's really going to be a fair plan in
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
the end for its work out and also gets
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the Department of
 
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.409 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the Department of
Education

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh so as I'd like to say is I think it's
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
a really unfair law right now for the
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
small towns because it's really
 
00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:03.770 align:start position:0%
small towns because it's really
impractical

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
impractical
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
unless you're gonna you're willing to
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
take you lose millions of dollars
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in equity that you've spent and when
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
you look at fair market value
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's taking into account depreciation
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
it's taking into account improvements it
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
looks at the contributions that have
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
been done over time by both towns and if
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
one town exclusively built it then
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
they'll get all the equity they don't
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
have to pay Town B anything
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
but that's probably not the case in
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
general they may have paid more but
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
it'll be proportional so I think this is
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
a really important law to adjust because
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of fairness to all the
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts in New
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you very much
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes represent boam
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you question
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
if I remember my history correctly uh
 
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:54.260 align:start position:0%
there was the Hollis Brookline Mason
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
initial agreement
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
pulled out some years ago remember right
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's not correct Mason
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
was with another town we have another
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
witness here okay that'll speak to the
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
brook the Mason issue
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
there is another uh town that I know
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
also recently had a problem with Sandown
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to pull out a Timber Lane and
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
that was also the same exact problem
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
that Brookline had in their Co-op
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and so it's been at least two
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
instances recently that this has been a
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
challenge where it's been brought forth
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
gone to a warn article and then stopped
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
because of this Equity issue
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Porter
 
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:37.430 align:start position:0%
the chair so we've been assuming here
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.050 align:start position:0%
the chair so we've been assuming here
[Music]

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
town is the bigger town
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's what it is in the hypothetical
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
example yes okay so if county is the
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
smaller town
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
but the school is located in it
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
and town B pulls out
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
then town a has to pay Town B
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
and be left with a bigger building that
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
they don't need anymore
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
without the support of the taxpayers in
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
town B to maintain it plus they have to
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
pay off a bond
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the bigger town to pay off what's
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
owed on the uh on the building
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
how does what happens then in that
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
scenario to town a
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
is that fair to town a so you're I'm
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your example here
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying town a has doesn't have
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
buildings or town a no town a is the
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
smaller town but the school is located
 
00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:32.339 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay it would work the same way I mean
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
you would step still pay off yes you
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
would still pay off and you
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
and a larger chunk of the equity because
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
but presumably time to be paid more into
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
the building of it and you would have to
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
take out a bond to do that
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
you would have
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
a few many fewer students because Town B
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
is the small is the bigger town so they
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
won't be there anymore so you've got a
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
building that's bigger than you need
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
with fewer students than you had and
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
less people have helping to maintain it
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
plus you have a bond to pay off for
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
five or eight or ten million dollars or
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the larger portion of the
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
equity going to the bigger town so how
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
does that help town a what will town a
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
do in that circumstances in your opinion
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
is that fair
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's fair because you everybody
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
in town a in town B collectively as the
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
co-op voters decide on that and I don't
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
see that it's any more unfair than
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
what's happening right now and I think
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's actually probably I don't know if
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
there would be an example of that it
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
would be highly unlikely but in that
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
case I still think it's that's the way
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
the further questions
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
uh now we'll have the representative
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
from Mason uh representative John
 
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.370 align:start position:0%
from Mason uh representative John
lewicki

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you good morning Mr chairman
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm John lewicki I represent
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
Brookline and Mason and Brookline Mason
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
have never had any disagreements
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
um however I don't see anyone here from
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
back in the day when I uh was before
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
this committee on a yearly basis before
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
Mason was able to withdraw and I do have
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
the perspective of being someone who was
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
very active in trying to get Mason out
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the Messianic district and I'm going
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
to use the names of the districts I hope
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's not um
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
verboten because it's so much easier to
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically Mason was the smallest town in
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
the district
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
the district was formed in 1968 I
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
believe don't quote me on the date and
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
calling these districts Cooperative is a
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
misnomer these basically were shotgun
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
marriages imposed based on somebody's
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
brain child here in Concord on the towns
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
and put towns that were not really
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
similar demographically or in their
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
goals or whatever in together and said
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay you guys are going to have a school
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
district together even though they had
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
been doing just fine previous to that
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
Mason as I may have said was the
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
smallest town in a three-town district
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
and the district was formed in 68 there
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
was then a bond around 2008 the initial
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
Bond expired around 2008 and there was a
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
new Bond to build new facilities
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
those facilities were expensive state of
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
the art but buildings don't educate
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
children and what we had was a
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
District which really was not suited to
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
Mason's wants or needs that was
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
providing an education very different
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
from what we would have chosen on our
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
own what we had chosen on our own prior
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the being forced into the district
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
and so I spent many years I don't see
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
anybody here on the committee who was
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
here when I was here back in the early
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
2000s in any case we passed that Bond
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
and within a year or two at the next
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
district meeting it was moved to amend
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
and that was to basically make Mason pay
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
a larger share of the capital expenses
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
essentially the bond and we successfully
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
defeated that but it was year after year
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
and school district meeting after school
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
district meeting with people including
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
myself red in the face yelling at the
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
opposite opposing side it was a toxic
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
atmosphere did not do anything to
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
benefit the students and one point to uh
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
for representative Porter is that the
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
budget the articles of agreement
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
distinguish between operating expenses
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be heating lighting salaries
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
fixing the roof and so forth and capital
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
expense which is new buildings you know
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
significant expenses that would be
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
bonded and so uh that is uh within the
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement and not a real
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
issue when you start talking about
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
dividing up the Capital Property which
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
is the stuff that had been bonded in any
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
case after
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
more than a decade of hostile uh
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
situations the state then condemned
 
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
effectively condemned one of the
 
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
district's buildings and it was a need
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
for a bond so we were now in the
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
situation where the other towns wanted
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
had to build a new building and they
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
needed to raise money for a bond and
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
they also knew that Mason was not going
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
to support a bond for a district that
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
was toxic toxic and hostile to them and
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
so at that point they had to let us go
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
and we did get out and we are in a
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
better place now so uh you know so much
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
of this was personal for me and one of
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
the point is that all of this is
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
dependent on the 20-year Bond cycle
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is that uh even if
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
the district is not providing a suitable
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
education for students we will have
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
complete sets of children go from first
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
grade through 12th grade
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
um in a district which does not educate
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
them to the liking of their town or to
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
their parents and there is they held in
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
bondage while this is going on and the
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
only time and way that a town can
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
withdraw as we did is at the end of a
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
bond cycle
 
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.870 align:start position:0%
bond cycle
that's

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's most of what I have to say and uh
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think if people have uh you know
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions they'd like to ask me
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
personally that may not be suitable for
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
all of the committee then feel free to
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
talk to me afterwards but I am happy to
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you very much
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
for Delhi uh thank you and thank you
 
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.650 align:start position:0%
for Delhi uh thank you and thank you
representative

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.370 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
is uh you said Mason was the smallest
 
00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.870 align:start position:0%
is uh you said Mason was the smallest
um

00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
in the three-town district
 
00:44:07.329 --> 00:44:07.339 align:start position:0%
um what was the uh per student payment
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
for the three towns in the district
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
um from instances that I know of
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
um very often the smaller town maybe
 
00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:19.579 align:start position:0%
without the facilities
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
pays much more in per student costs into
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the district than maybe the larger towns
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
I don't recall it's long enough to know
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
that I don't have that information but
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
that would be within the operating
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
expenses and that was never the
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
operating expenses were never an issue
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
it was you know Shifting the bond an
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
unfair amount of the bond payment to the
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:52.130 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
moffatt

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
moffatt
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
you said that when the bond issue for
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
the new building came up that the other
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
two large communities let Mason go
 
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.650 align:start position:0%
two large communities let Mason go
and

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
um could you elaborate a little bit on
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
this how they let Mason go thank you
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative we had had almost
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
annually if not annually it proposed
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
information to withdraw over the course
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
of a decade or more
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
and at that when we finally reached the
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
end of that Bond
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
the other towns realized that Mason
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
would vote unanimously not to approve a
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
bond that would cause them to remain in
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
the scenic for another 20 years and so
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get and Mason
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
got out the vote we could always have
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
most of the town at a meeting whereas
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
the other towns would have a less
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
representation and I believe it's
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to pass a bond and so without
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
Masons will being willing they could not
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
get a new Bond approved
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%

01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board by means of a
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant article
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
the need for this bill was brought to my
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
attention by a constituent
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
under current statute the composition of
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative school board can be
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
determined by one of five methods these
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
methods specify the number of board
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
members how they are selected in the
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
terms of the members
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
changing any of these is considered
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of the school board
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
so at this time please reference the
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
handout that I prepared for this bill as
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
I detail the issue
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill serves to address as well as
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
the change to current statute that the
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
bill proposes
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
first under current Statute in order to
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
place a petitioned article to
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
reapportion a co-op school board on the
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
warrant for either an annual or a
 
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:27.380 align:start position:0%
special meeting
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
signatures of 10 percent of registered
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
voters in the co-op
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
are required
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
second in any other case the case of any
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
other petitioned article signatures of
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
25 or 2 percent of registered voters
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
whichever is less
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
is required for an annual meeting
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
or the signatures of five percent of
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
registered voters is required for a
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
special meeting
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
thus the issue at hand is that under
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
current statute a petitioned article to
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
propose reapportionment of a co-op
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
School Board must meet an arbitrary and
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
out of the ordinary higher signature
 
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.649 align:start position:0%
out of the ordinary higher signature
standard

01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
such a significantly higher signature
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
standard pertaining exclusively to the
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
issue of reapportionment of a co-op
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
School Board is neither a logical nor
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
warranted this bill modifies current
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
statute so that the signature
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
requirement is the same for any and all
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
petitioned articles in a Cooperative
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
School District
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill addresses the
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and extraordinarily higher
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
signature requirement for a petitioned
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
article relative to the reapportionment
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
of a co-op school board and enacts the
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
same signature standard as for any other
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
petition article and that concludes my
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill Mr chairman
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if you
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
was this the only other card we have
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh the next uh
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
Eric

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
hello education committee members thank
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak I'm Eric power
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
again from uh from Brookline
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and um I just want to give you a
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
perspective on this in the Hollis
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
Brookline Co-op which is the co-op
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
School District that we're in
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh I moved to Brookline in 1994 and at
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
that time the school board had seven
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
members five from Hollis and two from
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
Brookline and at that time Brookline was
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
one of the fastest growing towns in the
 
01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
one of the fastest growing towns in the
state

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
and if you looked at the populations
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
that was Brookline grew so quickly in
 
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
the 90s by 96 97 we were
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
a large percentage of the co-op but
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
still only had two out of seven members
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
and myself and other citizens tried to
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
get the school board to put
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
in a reapportionment of the school board
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
to get another member from Brookline for
 
01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:39.739 align:start position:0%
many years we tried it for a long time
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
finally in 2003 there was a article the
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
article was passed and that's when
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
reapportioned the board to be for Hollis
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
and three Brookline
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
it was impossible for citizens to bring
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
it forward as a petition Warren article
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
almost impossible because we at the time
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
had about 8 000 voters in the co-op that
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
means you'd have to go get 800
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
signatures just for this petition worn
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
article which was ridiculous
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't do it we just had to beg
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
the school board please put it on please
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
put it on they finally did so it was
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
very slow to be changed and then most
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
recently recently in 2021 they made an
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
update to the articles of an agreement
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
making sort of an administrative change
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
for some reason to change the dates of
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
the terms of the school board members
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
try to reapportion the board again
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
because now Hollis has caught up with us
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
and now they're they're underrepresented
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I know it sounds like I'm not
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
working but I wanted things to be fair
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
one man one vote
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and I talked to the school district
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
moderator and he says I'm not going to
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
allow you to make that Amendment so I
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
can communicated ahead of time you can't
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
make that Amendment just put it on as a
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
petition worn article like you do other
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
ones and I'm like do you know what that
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
means now we have over 10 000 voters in
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline that means I have to go
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
get a thousand signatures that's not a
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
trivial thing to do the standard of 25
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
is a high standard but it's you know
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
that takes some work especially in a
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic so it's essentially right now
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
without this change we're sort of at the
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
mercy of the school board to decide when
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
they need to be reapportioned and I'd
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
also like to point out the relationship
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
with this bill to the next bill coming
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
up from representative Litchfield House
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
Bill 1646 that
 
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
if that if if that bill is uh passed the
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
only the school board again would be
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
controlling when and if they reapportion
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
the school board the citizens wouldn't
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
be able to do it unless they meet this
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
really high standard
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that having 10 of the voters
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
to call uh to to put it on the warrant
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
is a is a ridiculously high standard I
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
hope that the education committee can
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
see that and we'll uh vote ought to pass
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
on this uh Bill thank you very much
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%

not CNA thank you very much
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
within the audience who would like to
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll call upon you to make the
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
motion too
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay before everybody disappears we are
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
going to go moving forward now we're
 
01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay the bill which we're going to be
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
addressing uh is 15.75
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
relative to a waiver of tuition the
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
university system and Community College
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
system that's a bill we addressed
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
yesterday I believe

thing

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%

representative woodcock
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%

districts which we've heard much of

01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
versus another
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not it's Equitable
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not each town has
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
an equal say in what's happening on that
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
particular School Board
 
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:49.500 align:start position:0%

01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%

01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
mid-1990s at the point in time that that
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
was incorporated they were very good
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
intentions that were set but they had
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
just picked you know let's have this
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
many members from this town this town
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
this town and at this point in time
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
populations have changed but yet we do
 
01:53:13.450 --> 01:53:13.460 align:start position:0%
not have let's say equal representation
 
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
for each of the different sending
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
districts and quite honestly that's my
 
01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.330 align:start position:0%
districts and quite honestly that's my
concern

01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:23.060 align:start position:0%
um and it's funny because as I sit here
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
I was I was getting ready this morning
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
thinking about how I wanted to present I
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
do do my best thinking after my shower
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
so probably I should shower four times a
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
day not once a day and I'm sitting here
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
telling you how I want everyone's voice
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
to be heard yet I have a husband four
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
children two 100 pound dogs and a cat I
 
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
have to tell you I'm really good at
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
tuning people out so I'm feeling a
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
little but uh but I wanted just to say
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
that I I'm using that particular board
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
as an example we have nine members and
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller sending districts
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
they don't have the say that they feel
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
that they really should have for example
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
some of them have one person that
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
they're sending and they just aren't
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
feeling as though they have a voice at
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
the table and to take it a step further
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
in looking at that and I I won't
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for continuing to go back to
 
01:54:17.649 --> 01:54:17.659 align:start position:0%
that District that's what I know best
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
but I would welcome anything that you
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
have to say because I've learned it
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
quite a bit today actually with other
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
bills as far as unintended consequences
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
so I want to want to thank you for that
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
teaching moment actually but I would
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to electing members
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
one thing that has also happened and I
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it was by intent or design I
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
think it was by default is you have all
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
of these towns in a regional district
 
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
and for us anyway every single town is
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
voting for each individual Town's member
 
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to give you an example we
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
have you know one town that has let's
 
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
say we have 15 000 voters but yet we
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
have another town that has 3 000
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
registered voters the town that has the
 
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand voters they also vote
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
on who the board member will be for
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
those smaller towns and at this point
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's come to my attention that the
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
smaller towns are saying hook hey look
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
we just don't think it's fair that some
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
of these larger towns are deciding who
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
our representative is going to be it's
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
very important to us that we decide who
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
that representative is going to be so
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
the bill is twofold I'm looking to have
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
equal representation Nation per town on
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
these Cooperative school boards and I'm
 
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
looking to say you know what when it
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
comes to voting in ascending District
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
may we have that sending District simply
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
be the only one to vote on their
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative and um and I want to say
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for listening and
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
I am open to anything as far as
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
construction criticism or amendments I
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
do have to say though if for some reason
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
you decide that you want to exec this
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
today that would really make for a great
 
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.129 align:start position:0%
today that would really make for a great
story

01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative and we'll open it up now
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to questions from the committee
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli then represent
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
Allison uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
 
01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.609 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
forward

01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
um would it be the case if all the towns
 
01:56:32.169 --> 01:56:32.179 align:start position:0%
are voting for
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
Town voters are voting for the member
 
01:56:39.010 --> 01:56:39.020 align:start position:0%
from each individual Town
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
it would be hard for
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
some of those towns to know the person
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
on the ballot for a town maybe on the
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
other side of the
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
co-op District it
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
would that be a problem in your view
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
I would absolutely view that as a
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
problem and I would say just just as an
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
example right now for example it's we're
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
coming up on Election time in March
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
right now people are filing it's a large
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
district and we're looking at rather
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
than let's say a person from the smaller
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
town let's say buying buying their signs
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
or getting their word out to the people
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
in their individual towns they're
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
looking at needing to go out to six
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
different towns the only thing I can
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
equate it to is I look at it like our
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
town has one State Rep yet you know the
 
01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.209 align:start position:0%
town has one State Rep yet you know the
senator

01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:35.219 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
represent several towns I almost feel as
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
though that particular board member
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's going out it's almost as if
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're running for a senate seat you
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
know they're going out and they're going
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up go ahead uh
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
um do you think that that uh the current
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
system as you describe uh favors the uh
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
it could most definitely favor the
 
01:58:15.550 --> 01:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
incumbent I'm sure but my concern
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
truthfully my concern is and I've heard
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
this over the years
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
is people that are out there and they're
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
saying you know what if we can get this
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
larger town in this larger town just to
 
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
support this we can forget about the
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
other three or four towns and I just
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
don't feel that that's fair equitable
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:58:36.599 --> 01:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
representative

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh thank you Mr
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
question uh just some clarification on
 
01:58:44.699 --> 01:58:46.250 align:start position:0%
question uh just some clarification on
uh

01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
equal representation your concept of
 
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
equal representation it looks like in
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're talking about at
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
least one
 
01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.669 align:start position:0%
least one
person

01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:56.870 align:start position:0%
person
so

01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
that and I would assume that would be
 
01:59:00.250 --> 01:59:00.260 align:start position:0%
from smaller towns
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
are you talking something beyond that I
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
mean are you talking some way of
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
deciding that
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
Exeter is going to have eight and
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else is going to have one based
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
on population or am I getting this wrong
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
so my preference would be for it not to
 
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:17.420 align:start position:0%
be based on the population
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
the only thing I can equate it to is
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
maybe the popular vote versus the
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
electoral vote and I look at as though
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
some of these towns the larger towns if
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
they have 20 000 voters versus a smaller
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
town that has 1500 1600 voters many
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
times they're out voted so let's say for
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
example there's going to be a capital
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
improvement with a bond that costs 20
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars for example those
 
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
smaller towns aren't necessarily feeling
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
as though their voices are being heard
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
and if I may take it a step further
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
because I am open to suggestions for
 
01:59:56.699 --> 01:59:57.770 align:start position:0%
because I am open to suggestions for
this

01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
it was difficult in trying to decide how
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
much representation should every town
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
have and I'm going to go back to and I
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
hope that's okay this particular example
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
Exeter there are nine board members
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
right now which relatively speaking that
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
is pretty large when you're trying to
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
get a decision made some towns have
 
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
three reps some have two a few towns
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
only have one representative
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to say you know part of
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
me is okay maybe one representative per
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
town would be sufficient because then we
 
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
would have a board of let's say six but
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
I can understand why some towns would
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
want two or three members but if we were
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
to consistently have two or three
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
members per Town it'd be like herding
 
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:45.659 align:start position:0%
cats I think right we'd have potentially
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
18 board members
 
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you are there
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
on Jefferson luno
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
um uh for taking my question it
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
to to follow up on representative
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
Ellison's question I just want to make
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
sure I understand this
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
um this actually deletes the words at
 
02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:10.850 align:start position:0%
um this actually deletes the words at
least

02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
every pre-existing District would have
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
one resident representative is that is
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
that how I'm reading this
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
that is how you are reading this yes
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
but but representative as I mentioned if
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
this board feels that it is imperative
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
that there is more than one member per
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
town I would most definitely be open to
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
amendments I mean it's I think we're all
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
learning every day sure sure they know
 
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock you had your
 
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
hand up and then I see represent Porter
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
put her hand up as well thank you
 
02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
put her hand up as well thank you
representative

02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
almost good afternoon uh you mentioned
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
in the uh introduction that there is an
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
increase in population in the district
 
02:02:00.729 --> 02:02:00.739 align:start position:0%
are you talking the student population
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh from the from the sunny towns where
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
it's okay if I say both but specifically
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
I would say student population I'll give
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
you an example one of the much smaller
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
sending towns it's interesting they've
 
02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
had a large increase in student
 
02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.490 align:start position:0%
had a large increase in student
population

02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:02:26.689 --> 02:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
um since
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
since the co-op was formed and probably
 
02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:31.139 align:start position:0%
because it's an excellent school system
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
if I can just say that right probably
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
because it is such an excellent school
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
system that being said though the
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
population has increased
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
to about 20 percent let's say we're
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
sending 20 percent of our students we're
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
in a difficult spot though because we
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
have 80 percent of our voting population
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
that does not have children in the
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
school system too so it's a little bit
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
of a balancing act but what's happening
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
at this point in time is some of these
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
towns and this is a whole other issue I
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to go down the rabbit hole
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
but due to the equalization property
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
values industry all of that we're not
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
all paying the same amount right to send
 
02:03:14.649 --> 02:03:14.659 align:start position:0%
our kids and it's very difficult because
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
these smaller towns end up spending more
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I like I said I just feel they should
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
have at least some say at the table
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you chairman
 
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand and following up
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
on representative luno and Allison's
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
comment so the board would go to I think
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
he said six thousands in this case would
 
02:03:37.129 --> 02:03:37.139 align:start position:0%
be six
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
so the bill as structured this would be
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
applicable to all the districts in the
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
state correct
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
yes so towns that are having no problem
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
have multiple people on the board
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to reduce it down to three
 
02:03:53.089 --> 02:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
or two or five
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
without their without their knowledge or
 
02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:56.510 align:start position:0%
without their without their knowledge or
consent

02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
is working
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
well they'd know once we pass about no
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
just kidding
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
um no but I see I see absolutely I mean
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
that a respectful way it's just my sense
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
of humor but
 
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes you're absolutely right there could
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
be some places that are not having any
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
issues right now but there's one thing
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
that I want to go back to and that is
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
always I'm not big this is my only Bill
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm sponsoring I'm not big on
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
adding more laws or bills even policies
 
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the school district I'm not big on
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
adding them but one thing that I always
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
do say to folks is simply because things
 
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
are running well now we don't know how
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to be later you don't know
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have the same
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
superintendent or the same board member
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
down the road so sometimes it's best I
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
think if we take these things on head on
 
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thank you
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Porter
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
um so I thought of a question while I
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
was listening to um the other question
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
so Hillsborough during my school
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
district is Hillsboro daring Cooperative
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
School District we have two towns
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
would this bring our school board down
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm going to say this as we
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier you had brought up
 
02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
with another bill unintended
 
02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.149 align:start position:0%
with another bill unintended
consequences

02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
um which I'm I'm learning more and more
 
02:05:24.649 --> 02:05:24.659 align:start position:0%
about today
 
02:05:24.659 --> 02:05:25.310 align:start position:0%
about today
um

02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
I do believe at this point in time
 
02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
probably I would need an amendment to
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
fix that also in talking and I think it
 
02:05:35.209 --> 02:05:35.219 align:start position:0%
was representative Woodcock that made a
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
very good point if we were to have six
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
sending towns we would have an even
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
number of members and potentially that
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
would be an issue as well so I do think
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
that I would need to work on that but I
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
would ask you as being the education
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
committee and is being seasoned I would
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
really welcome any suggestions you have
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
to improve this bill because I think
 
02:06:00.729 --> 02:06:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm mixing my my uh apples and
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
oranges here but Hillsborough Deering is
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
also part of SAU
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
34 which includes the towns of
 
02:06:17.649 --> 02:06:17.659 align:start position:0%
Washington Windsor Hillsboro and Deering
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
and when we have the school board
 
02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
meeting for the SAU
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
which is different than the school
 
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.310 align:start position:0%
which is different than the school
district

02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
the different towns have different
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
weights of votes
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
so that might be something that you
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
might consider Hillsborough being the
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
largest town
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
could have a weighted vote which counts
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
more than the vote from
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
you know it might have a value of two
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
while the vote from Windsor has a value
 
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
of one in the vote count we don't it's
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
not often that it's used but it is
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
available as an option when Hillsboro
 
02:06:59.330 --> 02:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
wants to get its way it can pull it out
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
usually doesn't but it can so I'm just
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
throwing that out there as a
 
02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
is it all right if I were to ask you a
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
question back
 
02:07:12.729 --> 02:07:12.739 align:start position:0%
um uh well
 
02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's not really where we want to go uh
 
02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
with uh people at the podium there
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
asking questions back uh you could
 
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
always uh phrase your response and a
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
response without having to use you know
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
the question methodology Okay so
 
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking in terms again of the
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
current board it's what I know best and
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
I do believe that there is a type of a a
 
02:07:40.729 --> 02:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
weighted methodology that we could use
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
and when I have reviewed it
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's come down to tenths or
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
something it's very confusing and I feel
 
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
as though it's not often
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
utilized I don't know that it would be
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
very impactful but on top of that let's
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
say in the moment of when I'm doing the
 
02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
executive session right now and I'm
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
counting up the votes I think it can be
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
cumbersome in the moment for people to
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
figure that out and necessarily to make
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure that that is done correctly and I
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
do wonder if we consider the weighted
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
vote if we're back with the same issue
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to correct
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
how does that chair it's fun any further
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mullen
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:08:32.159 --> 02:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
so

02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to make the assumption that
 
02:08:39.129 --> 02:08:39.139 align:start position:0%
the original
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
proportion of school board members to
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
school population was based on the same
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
reason why we have towns that have seven
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
representatives and towns that have 11
 
02:08:55.209 --> 02:08:55.219 align:start position:0%
representatives and that is that
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh one School Board member would in fact
 
02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
be representing a certain number of
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
residents slash students so in your case
 
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many Exeter how many
 
02:09:13.490 --> 02:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
school board members Exeter has but
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
it would stand to reason that it would
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
be more than Brentwood is that correct
 
02:09:19.739 --> 02:09:21.830 align:start position:0%
be more than Brentwood is that correct
so

02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
the second latter half of that is
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
correct as far as the initial paperwork
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
is concerned I have a copy of that and
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's signed by and apologizes seven or
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
nine members I should have counted first
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
I have actually interviewed a couple of
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
them several times to try to figure out
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
how the number of representatives were
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
determined and at this point
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
they they it's just it was arbitrary you
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
know that was their response it was
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary we're not we're not even able
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
to find paperwork any place at this
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
point in time that
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
explains to us why each of the other
 
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:08.420 align:start position:0%
towns is voting for that particular
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
District sending member and so I think
 
02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
to go back to let's say our state house
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's fair if members
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
from Hollis would vote for who the
 
02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
Brentwood representative is going to be
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
right I think that so the the bill is
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
twofold so I don't necessarily I don't
 
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that that would be
 
02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:30.410 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that that would be
fair

02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
follow it all sure thank you
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
um I I certainly understand your issue
 
02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:37.850 align:start position:0%
um I I certainly understand your issue
with

02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
one town voting for another Town's
 
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative uh I I certainly
 
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
understand that what I was getting to is
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
the original language in RSA 195 19. um
 
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
indicates that the number of board
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
members would be based on the total
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
student population or community
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
population or whatever much as we're
 
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
you know we have 3 400 people that we
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
represent as Representatives I'm
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
wondering how a school district that
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
currently has two or three
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
board members because they're that large
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how that school board
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
member is going to feel if they're now
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
the only School Board member from that
 
02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:25.250 align:start position:0%
the only School Board member from that
town

02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
you understand what I'm saying
 
02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
I live it I've lived it first six years
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
so I completely understand
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
and it's a very difficult place to be
 
02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:37.189 align:start position:0%
and it's a very difficult place to be
um

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
so my example and I don't know if it's
 
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
the best example I just look at it let's
 
02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
say for example national elections
 
02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:48.050 align:start position:0%
say for example national elections
um

02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
I just look at it as as though where if
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
we go straight by population the larger
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
States I feel as though are always going
 
02:11:59.209 --> 02:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
to determine what happens for the entire
 
02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
country and I don't know that that's
 
02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
country and I don't know that that's
fair

02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'll take the other questions
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
without seeing hands thank you very much
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
and thank you you were all very kind
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have one other
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
card up here uh bear Christina from the
 
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd thank you
 
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear Christino
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
Association we're opposed to 1646 and
 
02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'll get into a couple reasons why
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
um first I want to thank representative
 
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
Litchfield for her dedicated work on her
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
local school board you know we were
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
always appreciative of that as well to
 
02:12:49.679 --> 02:12:51.530 align:start position:0%
always appreciative of that as well to
representative

02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the the concerns that we've heard
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
today relative to Cooperative school
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
districts uh we've heard from different
 
02:12:59.450 --> 02:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board members
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
um not just recently but over the last
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
I'd say number of years there was a
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
study committee I believe it was the
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
summer of 2017 if I'm not mistaken that
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
took a look at changing some of the
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
procedures for withdrawing from
 
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts I think
 
02:13:17.290 --> 02:13:17.300 align:start position:0%
that's RSA
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
19425 so nhsba's larger proposal and I
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative chairman lad and I had a
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
quick conversation earlier this morning
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
nhsba would certainly support
 
02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
um a study commission over the course of
 
02:13:35.089 --> 02:13:35.099 align:start position:0%
a couple years to look at the entirety
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
of RSA 195. we've heard about some we've
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
heard some issues about the withdrawing
 
02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh withdrawing and who has to pay for
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
what some concerns about how school
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
board members are elected within the uh
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative school district and some
 
02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
of the other challenges with some of the
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
other the other bills those are just
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
sort of scratching the surface um I
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
think with the totality of RSA 195 and
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
my concern is if we change a little bit
 
02:14:04.729 --> 02:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
here in this statute and change a little
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
bit there in that statute
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
um there's always interplay between
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
these things you can't just change RSA
 
02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
195 25 and not necessarily see how that
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
may impact colon 9 colon 22 so on and so
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
forth so that would be on hsba's
 
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.970 align:start position:0%
forth so that would be on hsba's
proposal

02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:14:22.129 --> 02:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to work with you chairman
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
lad and put together some graph language
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
for the bills uh the committee's
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
consideration about putting together a
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
study commission my estimation that it
 
02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
would probably take a couple years
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
um to really do a deep dive into into
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
how we can um amend these statutes one
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
of the challenges is the the statute um
 
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
RSA 195 as we know it today was
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
initially drafted I believe in 1963.
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
um the educational landscape of New
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was obviously significantly
 
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
different in 1963 than it is now
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
population changes
 
02:14:58.189 --> 02:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
um uh demographic changes school funding
 
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
obviously I will tell you that one of
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the Cooperative School
 
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
District statute was to put
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
um property poor and property rich
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
communities together to have sort of a
 
02:15:08.639 --> 02:15:09.589 align:start position:0%
communities together to have sort of a
shared

02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
shared
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
shared understanding of public education
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
was for the greater good of New
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we also know that it
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense for every little town
 
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
and every little community of maybe two
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
or three thousand people to have its own
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
high school or have its own seven
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
through seven through twelve school so
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
they would have an elementary school
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
they would you know uh send the kids to
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative High School to share
 
02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
costs share administrative Services
 
02:15:35.209 --> 02:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
things of that nature to the bill um
 
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
itself specifically
 
02:15:41.089 --> 02:15:41.099 align:start position:0%
um by limiting um only to one method of
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
of Elections for
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
um uh School Board officer excuse me
 
02:15:47.089 --> 02:15:47.099 align:start position:0%
school board members in a Cooperative
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
School District
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um we think that further we have a lot
 
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:53.099 align:start position:0%
of talk about choice in this room don't
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
we um maybe giving the voters more
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
options to uh to to how they want to
 
02:15:59.689 --> 02:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
elect their their their their their
 
02:16:01.010 --> 02:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
members on their Cooperative School
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
Board completely understand
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield's concerns
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
about the larger Town dominating the you
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
know the when a smaller town has maybe
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
one vote on the the larger board and the
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
larger town has three votes I guess I
 
02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
would liken that to Concord is going to
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
have more State Representatives than
 
02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:18.410 align:start position:0%
have more State Representatives than
Chichester

02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
Chichester
 
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.030 align:start position:0%
Chichester
correct

02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
um also within um the the statute
 
02:16:26.209 --> 02:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
um the the voters have have the
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity RSA 195 19a lays out what is
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
it four or five different ways in which
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the the school board members can be
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
elected within that Community RSA 195 uh
 
02:16:41.929 --> 02:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
colon 19B
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
views and boy states that um
 
02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
any Cooperative School District pursuing
 
02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
to any uh created under RSA 195 at a
 
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
regular or special meeting can change
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
the number compensation method of
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
selection in terms of office so on and
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that this needs
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
requires the 10 petition number
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
signatures to to get on on the warrant
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
like the previous bill that we were
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
talking about I think this could
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
probably be submitted via petition with
 
02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
only the 25 voters that are required
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
under RSA 197 I think it's colon six
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
um so if if the voters in the in the
 
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.099 align:start position:0%
co-op don't necessarily like it there's
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
a method for them to change to one of
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
these other there's a process to change
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
to one of the other methods and I guess
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
the other challenge to more sort of
 
02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:30.290 align:start position:0%
the other challenge to more sort of
operationally

02:17:30.290 --> 02:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
operationally
 
02:17:33.410 --> 02:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to pass and we
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
um the statute limited the the the the
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
method of selecting
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
um members of The Cooperative School
 
02:17:42.669 --> 02:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
Board to only that one that one method
 
02:17:45.530 --> 02:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
when does that become a fact active or
 
02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
what do we do with sort of people that
 
02:17:49.009 --> 02:17:49.019 align:start position:0%
are with currently within their terms of
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
office you've got a nine member people
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
on the on the Cooperative the Exeter
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board I presume three
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
are up every year for election so you
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to is that you know
 
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
from this point forward we're going to
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
do that what happens with the remaining
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
six members is it retrospective those
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
are someone that I think the other
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
operational challenges with with the
 
02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
bill before us
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
um but regardless
 
02:18:15.530 --> 02:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I I I think that we need to review
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
um nhsba excuse me things out a
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of RSA 195 would be
 
02:18:21.179 --> 02:18:22.490 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of RSA 195 would be
appropriate

02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I'll work on some language and would
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
maybe ask for the the committee's
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
support and uh and having at least
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
having that discussion anyway and with
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
the committee may have
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your remarks uh
 
02:18:38.209 --> 02:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
Barrett are there any questions or from
 
02:18:40.610 --> 02:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
the committee on on the nature of this
 
02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:42.889 align:start position:0%
the committee on on the nature of this
bill

02:18:42.889 --> 02:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:42.899 --> 02:18:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Luna so thank you
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thanks thanks
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
very much Barrett for um for joining us
 
02:18:52.310 --> 02:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you um
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
you you had mentioned I and I noticed
 
02:18:55.549 --> 02:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
this too as I was sort of looking
 
02:18:59.450 --> 02:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
through the statutes that um 190 I'm
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
just looking at 195 18. on planning for
 
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.530 align:start position:0%
just looking at 195 18. on planning for
co-ops

02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
formed in 1963 that's correct as you
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
said and um and yes I mean amended
 
02:19:14.929 --> 02:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
several times beginning in 71 going
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
through 2021 but probably most the
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
language is
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
from 1963 1963 and
 
02:19:26.450 --> 02:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
and uh I know we've had there's been a
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion not just here in the
 
02:19:32.929 --> 02:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
education committee but um but um in you
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
know our school funding colleagues and
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
and those meetings with regards to
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
smaller schools or or smaller districts
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
versus larger districts do you think
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
maybe some of this language
 
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
um because it's so because it's you know
 
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
more than 50 years ago
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
um might be impeding
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
um school districts from considering
 
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
um more
 
02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
um organized agreements thank you for
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
the question representative
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
um you know we've seen a trend in New
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right say over the last 15
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
years or so
 
02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
um where rather than consolidation to
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
save costs we're seeing districts
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
breaking up saus or breaking up
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
um we know that there are some
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
communities that would like to withdraw
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
from their Cooperative School District
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
but it's either
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
financially prohibitive or they get
 
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
through the process and realize maybe
 
02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
isn't worth it as you for an educational
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
purpose or a financial purpose
 
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
um it's very curious too we know that
 
02:20:36.130 --> 02:20:36.140 align:start position:0%
Maine underwent forced consolidation
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
2008 I believe that was my understanding
 
02:20:41.889 --> 02:20:41.899 align:start position:0%
is that really didn't save many costs
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the committee may also want to be
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
aware that Vermont is just underwent
 
02:20:49.490 --> 02:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
forced consolidation
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um two or three years ago I think
 
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
they're kind of in their first or second
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
year they went from like
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
160 saus or whatever they call it in
 
02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
Vermont to like 60 or something like
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess New Hampshire however seems
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be trending in the opposite direction
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not that has you know
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the fiscal impact on that
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
I mean the reality is I mean my guess
 
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know just from hearing from some of
 
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
these it the town that wants to withdraw
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
always feels that they're paying too
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
much and not getting enough
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to be the the gist of of what
 
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
seems to be driving the desire to
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
withdraw from The Cooperative School
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
District property it comes down to
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes are not much they're
 
02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.809 align:start position:0%
property taxes are not much they're
paying

02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much is there
 
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
for the comment yes representative
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner hi
 
02:21:40.250 --> 02:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
do you think that there's any
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
um advantage to tying reapportionment on
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
school boards in Cooperative districts
 
02:21:49.969 --> 02:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
after the census uh like every 10 years
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
when we look at the new representation
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh for you know state representatives
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank for the question representative I
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
had not thought about that but that's
 
02:22:05.809 --> 02:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh uh Barrett uh if you could get that
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
information to us uh regarding the
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
possible commit for a commission now
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're not talking a committee we had a
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee back in 2017 that I appointed
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
which had I believe representative Jim
 
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
Grenier uh as chair we came back and
 
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
made some recommendations to kind of
 
02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
sliced and diced around the side a
 
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
little bit but never really got to the
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
heart of the issue
 
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
and we need to do this uh I know that
 
02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
Maine has gone ahead and tried to do
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
some consolidation they got one District
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
to consolidate that was Rumford and
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
Mexico right on either side the
 
02:22:49.250 --> 02:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
Androscoggin river that was kind of a
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
natural happening nothing else occurred
 
02:22:54.010 --> 02:22:54.020 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont has a similar
 
02:22:58.130 --> 02:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
ideology of organizing over there uh now
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
all their districts must have a high
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
school within they ran into problems
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
with Thetford Academy which is kind of a
 
02:23:05.929 --> 02:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
private slash public and they're still
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
struggling to get some resolution there
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
as well so this is a huge issue
 
02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
throughout we have issues in our own
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
state with the intergovernmental
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
districts I know of one
 
02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental District that's really
 
02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
upset because the majority of the people
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
live in Vermont and Vermont is driving
 
02:23:25.570 --> 02:23:25.580 align:start position:0%
the property taxes in New Hampshire
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's a sad scenario but that's fact so
 
02:23:31.490 --> 02:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's a number of areas where we have
 
02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
to look at and if you could please get
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
us that information that you're
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a commission a two-year
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
commission which is not a committee
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
comprised of people that come with
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
technical background and other members
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the public as well as representatives
 
02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
and Senators that I believe is this is a
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
heady topic a very heady topic if if I
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was something we could get
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
concluded in the next two or three weeks
 
02:24:02.929 --> 02:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh through a subcommittee work session
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'd do it but it it's not going to
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
happen you know it's just it's gonna we
 
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to do this and we
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity to bring
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
people in and really get that
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
information we need so great if you get
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
that to us we'd appreciate it certainly
 
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
well for the last I'm wonderful seeing
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
all of you again in person great to be
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you Barrett I don't
 
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
believe we have it oh we have one other
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:31.849 --> 02:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh Eric power
 
02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Eric power from Brookline
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
as I said before I served on the halls
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn Cooperative School Board
 
02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
I know a lot about Cooperative school
 
02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
boards might be a subject matter expert
 
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
in some people's opinion and I do like
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I do like the fact that I think
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
there's a problem if there's members if
 
02:25:01.849 --> 02:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
if a large town if all the towns are
 
02:25:04.969 --> 02:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
voting for the members for all of the
 
02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh member districts I think that that's
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
not a good thing I think that in a
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative government I think it
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
makes sense for
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
town a voters to pick their
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
representatives from town a and town B
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
to pick their voters from town B
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I do think that there should be more
 
02:25:23.210 --> 02:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
than one member though I think which
 
02:25:24.889 --> 02:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
that's a good tweak because you know in
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline we would only have two
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
school board members and that's not
 
02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
really going to probably work
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
um but it should be proportional I think
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
to the uh the populations and
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner just brought up
 
02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
thing I was trying to drive with the
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
moderator that I just was looking at the
 
02:25:44.450 --> 02:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
Census Data from 2020 and saw the Hollis
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
Brookline split is not accurate and
 
02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's a more suitable way to
 
02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
reapportion it says go ahead and do a
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
petition word article I mean where that
 
02:25:54.889 --> 02:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
went and go get a thousand signatures so
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to also point out that 195
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
19B doesn't specify a method of
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
reapportionment it's it's actually 195
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
22 which was the subject of the previous
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
bill that does require 10 percent of
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
Voters so that is a problem it's really
 
02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
up to the school board Because unless
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
somebody can get 10 of signatures which
 
02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
is a very high bar
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'd like to point out is
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
when there's a vacancy on the school
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
board we had one of our school board
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
members become an assistant
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent and she had to resign
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
with one of three members from Brookline
 
02:26:32.270 --> 02:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
and the current law is is that the
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
members from Brookline picked the
 
02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.690 align:start position:0%
members from Brookline picked the
replacement

02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:26:38.270 --> 02:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
so we had three members then we became
 
02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
two so there was me and another
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
gentleman that got to pick the
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
replacement because it was a board
 
02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
member from Brookline so it makes sense
 
02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
that voters from Brookline should pick
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
their the Brookline reps so I think that
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very good thing for this bill I
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
think that does need some amendments but
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's got some good good ideas
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
and intent in there and the one man one
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
vote principle should be followed I
 
02:27:02.929 --> 02:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
think to make sure that you have
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
proportional representation and you know
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
we also got to consider co-ops that have
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
as few as two and I know there's some
 
02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
that have as many as 10 and you have
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
co-ops that have
 
02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
um you know 1400 voters in a case of
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Woodstock and you've got
 
02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
winnekonet that has over 23 000 voters
 
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
so it ranges all over the map so you got
 
02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
to really look at a rule that would make
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
sense I think that you know I would look
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
at this in the committee to put possibly
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
modify it to do before emotional but
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is you know that every
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
District elects their own members so
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's my feelings on it I just want to
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide that to you from my background
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
and experience and I would be interested
 
02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
in helping out with the commission if
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
there is such a one um in the future
 
02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for your
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
input and I sat with a rep from
 
02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
Brookline for many years in the house
 
02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
here and I heard this story over and
 
02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
over and over again and uh it's time to
 
02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
get some resolution it really is we're
 
02:28:07.969 --> 02:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
there so thank you very much for your
 
02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:10.439 align:start position:0%

02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay there's no other pink cards right

Mr clerk correct so we're going to close

02:28:59.809 --> 02:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
this topic for years
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%

we are going to go forward now with the
 
02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
last bill this morning it's HB 1276
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is a bill allowing for school

district budgets and warn articles to
 
02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:00.300 align:start position:0%

for clarification purposes I understand
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment on this but we're
 
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill now these the the
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
not the prime but a sponsor the bill
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
here can allude to the fact that they're
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're suggesting some changes to the
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill that Amendment will not be acted
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
upon until it becomes ours at an
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
02:35:25.319 --> 02:35:28.490 align:start position:0%

2022-0044h the prime sponsor
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Harley had a last-minute
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
issue at home and unfortunately was
 
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
unable to attend she severely is
 
02:35:59.330 --> 02:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
disappointed because this would have
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
been her first bill that she would have
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
submitted but I'm gladly
 
02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to introduce this bill and
 
02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'd like to correct one
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
thing you cannot introduce this bill to
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
this committee it has to be introduced
 
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
by a person on the committee during the
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
so you can allude to it and discuss the
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
contents of what you're suggesting be
 
02:36:21.889 --> 02:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
amended but it's going to be have to be
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
introduced to this committee by a person
 
02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
on the committee during executive
 
02:36:25.979 --> 02:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
on the committee during executive
session

02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
my apologize Mr chairman I was given
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
incorrect information by several people
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
within the state house that anyone could
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
introduce and an amendment to the bill
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
prior to it being introduced you can
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
bring it forward and provide it to a
 
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
person on the committee and it will be
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
introduced at that time absolutely yes
 
02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:46.130 align:start position:0%
introduced at that time absolutely yes
if

02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:36:47.929 --> 02:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
with your pleasure I would like to speak
 
02:36:50.450 --> 02:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
to the amendment if if I could yes you
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you the amendment was
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
needed because there was an oversight in
 
02:36:58.849 --> 02:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
OLS as to the intention of the original
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
Bill the intention of the original bill
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
was to make this a requirement and it
 
02:37:06.770 --> 02:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
came out of OLS as being an enabling
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
bill so the amendment that that I have
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
here speaks to it as a requirement which
 
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
is really the only major change in this
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
bill the the impetus for this bill is
 
02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
that we feel transparency is extremely
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
important uh in today's age and we feel
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
the voters are owed information when
 
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
they go to vote on a school warrant on
 
02:37:32.570 --> 02:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
the school budget it would be very good
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
information to have on the cost per
 
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
students it's a very simple math on this
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill it basically it says that you would
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
take the the school budget amount on the
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
warrant article and you would divide it
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
by the number of students at the school
 
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
district reported to the state and that
 
02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
would be your cost per student that
 
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
would be determined of course by the
 
02:37:53.410 --> 02:37:53.420 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
before it gets onto onto the warrant
 
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
article we realize there are other costs
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
involved in in schooling but that's not
 
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
the issue here the issue is on on the
 
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
school warrant article the budget amount
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's good for for voters to know what
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
that amount would be per student
 
02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:12.349 align:start position:0%
that amount would be per student
um

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's not much else to say about this
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill I think uh again I want to
 
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
reiterate it's important for voters to
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
know uh what they're voting on and this
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge I think is important I think
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
there are people that are coming behind
 
02:38:28.969 --> 02:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
me that will support this bill I I did
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
present this to one of my school board
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
members who was in complete agreement
 
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
and if there are any questions involving
 
02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
the technical aspects of of how this
 
02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
would happen you could you could ask
 
02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:39.620 align:start position:0%
questions there
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
other than that I think um done if
 
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's any short question I know your
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
time is limited you have a lot of bills
 
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
this year so I would defer questions to
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
the people behind me and I thank you for
 
02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very very much
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh are there are you
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
willing to take short questions or we we
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
do have one hand up over here on the
 
02:39:02.809 --> 02:39:02.819 align:start position:0%
side uh two we have two hands up so
 
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Porter then represented
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
is your
 
02:39:08.210 --> 02:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'll promise not
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
to make it too long of a question the
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
figure that you want on the Warren
 
02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
article is including special education
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
costs Transportation heating maintenance
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the building all the whole budget of
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
this SAU
 
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
the school district divided by the
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
number of children or only the
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
educational part teachers teachers aides
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
purchases of textbooks things like that
 
02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
which one are we using my understanding
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
is whatever amount whatever dollar
 
02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
amount appears on the warrant article
 
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
that voters are voting on that number
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be divided by the reported number
 
02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
of students for a cost per student I
 
02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
would defer any technical questions to
 
02:39:54.410 --> 02:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
the latter to I think we have a speaker
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
coming behind me that could probably
 
02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
better explain that
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Litchfield
 
02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
I have a similar question I'll ask it
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
and if it needs to be deferred that's
 
02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:07.010 align:start position:0%
and if it needs to be deferred that's
fine

02:40:07.010 --> 02:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I I had a similar question and this
 
02:40:10.969 --> 02:40:10.979 align:start position:0%
directly goes against what the doe does
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
for a and I'm sorry because you're not
 
02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor it directly goes
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
against what the doe is presenting as a
 
02:40:20.929 --> 02:40:20.939 align:start position:0%
cost per student the doe does remove the
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
cost of Transportation it does remove
 
02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
special education and it does remove
 
02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
Food Service which should be
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
self-funding so I'm just curious what
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
the response that I just I my concern is
 
02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
that the number wouldn't be accurate so
 
02:40:37.370 --> 02:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
I my question to you is why are we going
 
02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
directly against what is posted on the
 
02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:41.510 align:start position:0%
directly against what is posted on the
DOE

02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
DOE
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
well my point would be is that whatever
 
02:40:45.889 --> 02:40:45.899 align:start position:0%
amount is being shown on the warrant
 
02:40:49.250 --> 02:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
article and let's say uh uh for a sake
 
02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
of argument let's say you're showing uh
 
02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars to vote on on the
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
warrant article that figure
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
no matter what it includes is on the
 
02:40:59.929 --> 02:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
Warren article that's what the voter is
 
02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
voting on and if you just divide that
 
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
figure by by the number of students you
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
would come out with a cost per student
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
realizing that's not the only cost
 
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
they're you know the state puts in money
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
and other and you know Federal and there
 
02:41:14.809 --> 02:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
are other issues involved here but on
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
that Warren article that people are
 
02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
voting on if they're voting on 15
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars and let's say it comes
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
out to be
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
argumentally speaking 16 000 per student
 
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
that would be good information for the
 
02:41:28.250 --> 02:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
voter to know it gives them some idea of
 
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
what they're they're voting on in
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
response to any other technical
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions about what you just mentioned
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative I would defer to I
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
believe I have a school board member
 
02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
coming behind me who could probably
 
02:41:40.610 --> 02:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative Thomas
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:41:50.570 --> 02:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
oh I can see it representative Woodcock
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
um on the first I'm looking at the I was
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment that we're
 
02:42:02.450 --> 02:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
alluding to which is different from the
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill in my mind beyond beyond the uh
 
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
02:42:11.330 --> 02:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
and that on line three it talks about
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
that it says all budget items or any one
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
article having an impact on the budget
 
02:42:18.479 --> 02:42:19.730 align:start position:0%
article having an impact on the budget
so

02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
if the school board is bringing a budget
 
02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:23.929 align:start position:0%
if the school board is bringing a budget
through

02:42:23.929 --> 02:42:23.939 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would be every individual item on
 
02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
02:42:31.610 --> 02:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
this is all all budget items or any worn
 
02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
articles there's two different documents
 
02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
so that would that would mean to me
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
anyhow every line item on the budget
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
which being some becomes the warrant
 
02:42:45.889 --> 02:42:45.899 align:start position:0%
number we'd have to also have a notation
 
02:42:48.770 --> 02:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
on it not not in the uh Amendment but in
 
02:42:50.690 --> 02:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
right my understanding is that the
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that was done just in the last
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
couple of days uh
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the intent is for just the total figure
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
not a line item okay but the bill itself
 
02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
has if if that in fact is found to be
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
what the bill actually says I'm I would
 
02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
hope the committee would take action to
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh to interpret that to be just a total
 
02:43:13.610 --> 02:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
figure we wouldn't want it line by line
 
02:43:14.990 --> 02:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would not that's what it says
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
though thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:22.200 align:start position:0%

next uh is Bob is it Slater s-l-a-t

welcome

02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm on here on behalf of Londonderry
 
02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
School District uh resident long-time
 
02:43:51.650 --> 02:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
resident and uh currently a school board
 
02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:53.389 align:start position:0%
resident and uh currently a school board
member

02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this uh House Bill
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
1276 and just wanted to uh come up here
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
see if anyone had a question on how we
 
02:44:07.130 --> 02:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
arrive at this or or why but I think the
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
transparency of this dollar amount is is
 
02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
good for the community members as this
 
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
question comes to us
 
02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:15.770 align:start position:0%
question comes to us
several

02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
I won't say hundreds but a lot of
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
question comes to this during the budget
 
02:44:23.270 --> 02:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
season and during the school year
 
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
um on just what it costs per student to
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
go to our school district so I'm here
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
for any questions again I'm in support
 
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
of this and would welcome any questions
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you here
 
02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
representing the Londonderry school
 
02:44:43.610 --> 02:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
board or are you just here as a
 
02:44:45.770 --> 02:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
Londonderry School Board member I am
 
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
just here as a Londonderry School Board
 
02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
member and a resident of Londonderry
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
does the Londonderry School Board
 
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
support this bill I I we have not talked
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
about this I'm here just representing
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
myself thank you represent a boom
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just to clarify what I I read
 
02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the article it says the all
 
02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
School District budget to any school
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
district warrant out of having the cost
 
02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.110 align:start position:0%
district warrant out of having the cost
impact

02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:45:15.290 --> 02:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
the num uh notation printed next to the
 
02:45:17.389 --> 02:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
affected article stating so in other
 
02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
words the main article saying you will
 
02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
spend 15 million dollars that's the cost
 
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
if there's another article saying we
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
want to do this and that's going to be
 
02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
the cost is that is that correct
 
02:45:31.610 --> 02:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I will go back to our representative
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
that presented this I'm not sure what
 
02:45:36.170 --> 02:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
they mean in their language here
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
um but basically what we have on the
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
warrant is our budget to operate then
 
02:45:42.770 --> 02:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
we'll have several warrant articles that
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
are voted on separately and approved so
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
I would say the main cost would include
 
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the budget
 
02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
definitely you could take that amount if
 
02:45:55.610 --> 02:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
approved by the voters or the default
 
02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
budget that would give you a dollar
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
amount listed on the warrant for voting
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah just reading it said
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
on that every one article Faithfully
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
says next to the affected article will
 
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
state the course for students so
 
02:46:14.450 --> 02:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
yeah and that could very well be and
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would be another part of
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
transparency that if you were to vote
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
yay on this of say you know three three
 
02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars it would be
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
this much per student
 
02:46:28.010 --> 02:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
further question represent uh Tanner
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:46:34.849 --> 02:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:46:34.859 --> 02:46:35.630 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the calculation of Simply taking a
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
figure a number dividing it by the
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
number of pupils and I'm not sure
 
02:46:45.290 --> 02:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
whether you're using like average daily
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
enrollment or not is not really an
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
accurate uh picture
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh of what the school is using the money
 
02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.250 align:start position:0%
uh of what the school is using the money
for

02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
um don't you think wouldn't you think
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
that perhaps on the Warren articles and
 
02:47:03.410 --> 02:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns do this put at the end of
 
02:47:05.450 --> 02:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
the warn article the effects on the tax
 
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
rate in other words article Warren
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
article number one is going to raise
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
your your tax rate 0.01 or whatever
 
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
would be a more accurate way than trying
 
02:47:18.650 --> 02:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
to include or trying to make this simple
 
02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
to include or trying to make this simple
math

02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
math
 
02:47:22.849 --> 02:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
which does not include as representative
 
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
Porter had said before special ed costs
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
um costs of homeschool students coming
 
02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
in and using different facilities like
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the sports facility or perhaps chemistry
 
02:47:38.809 --> 02:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
lab doesn't include
 
02:47:38.819 --> 02:47:39.469 align:start position:0%
lab doesn't include
um

02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:42.490 --> 02:47:42.500 align:start position:0%
Transportation Food Service
 
02:47:45.410 --> 02:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
toilet paper you know all kinds of
 
02:47:46.849 --> 02:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
things so
 
02:47:49.250 --> 02:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
um don't you think that the having
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
simply on the Warren article the
 
02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of increase on the tax rate
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be a more accurate figure for a
 
02:47:58.730 --> 02:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
voter and a taxpayer
 
02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes per that's a great Point um the main
 
02:48:04.610 --> 02:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
the main Budget on the warrant could
 
02:48:06.410 --> 02:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
have cost per student because that's
 
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
basically the operating the Warren
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
articles from that point on could have a
 
02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
percentage added to the cost per student
 
02:48:15.410 --> 02:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh the individual items beyond that
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
because those are not incorporated into
 
02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
the original budget so to your point
 
02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
um doing it on the budget
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the I think you could come up with
 
02:48:28.130 --> 02:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
the easy formula 4 000 students on 80
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
million is is X on the warrant articles
 
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
you could do a percentage would would
 
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
increase by this because there Warren
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
articles now do tell you spell out it's
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
two cents per on the tax dollar if
 
02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
approved already every individual
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
warrant article as well as the budget
 
02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
sets the tax rate so I think simple math
 
02:48:50.450 --> 02:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
on the main budget and then you could do
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
a percentage on the additional line
 
02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:54.050 align:start position:0%
a percentage on the additional line
items

02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
items
 
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up on that yes you may
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so yes that and that in fact is what
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
the town I live in
 
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
um actually tries to tries to do
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
um but they don't do the per pupil the
 
02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
simple math what I'm what I'm trying to
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh convey I guess or ask is do you think
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
the simple math of taking and again
 
02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
there are various ways to compute who
 
02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
how many pupils are actually going to
 
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
your school and being paid for by your
 
02:49:26.450 --> 02:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
school the simple Act of dividing one
 
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
number by another number is not
 
02:49:31.250 --> 02:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
transparent does not reflect
 
02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh the true cost per pupil Johnny Jones
 
02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
might be twenty thousand dollars a year
 
02:49:40.130 --> 02:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
you might have somebody come in with a
 
02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
special ed student that was a hundred
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year and yet you're
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
then by the simple math just just kind
 
02:49:52.010 --> 02:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
of massaging it over the the whole thing
 
02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
I think what this bill is trying to get
 
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
at is to the point
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I I think this representative here
 
02:50:01.610 --> 02:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
had spoken about is at the department of
 
02:50:04.490 --> 02:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
Ed Transportation uh special ed is not
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
included I think for transparency for
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers this is a is a Formula
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
across the board per student and I I
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you special education some
 
02:50:16.429 --> 02:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
cost per student are much higher than
 
02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
than regular students or or some may be
 
02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
outsourced but we still hold a
 
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
placeholder for any homeschooled
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
children so if they decided at a future
 
02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
time they wanted to come back into the
 
02:50:30.770 --> 02:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
building we have to have that position
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that but I think this
 
02:50:35.330 --> 02:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
is just basically to tell the taxpayers
 
02:50:39.050 --> 02:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
we're at 20 000 per student All In
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know as an average And if every
 
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
every town was able to do this you could
 
02:50:46.490 --> 02:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
see where that is there are different
 
02:50:48.889 --> 02:50:48.899 align:start position:0%
formulas and that that would probably be
 
02:50:50.690 --> 02:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
have to looked at and make sure the
 
02:50:53.450 --> 02:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
state that they're all going by the same
 
02:50:55.250 --> 02:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
formula to come up with this cost per
 
02:50:57.410 --> 02:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
student and and just to have it on the
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
warrant gives a taxpayer an idea of what
 
02:51:05.270 --> 02:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
reps on luno
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
02:51:11.929 --> 02:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Slater for uh being
 
02:51:13.790 --> 02:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
with us this morning and also for your
 
02:51:15.770 --> 02:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh for the service to your community and
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
and School District in Londonderry
 
02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
um would um would the um
 
02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:22.010 align:start position:0%
um would um would the um
um

02:51:22.010 --> 02:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
would the numerator here the cost of the
 
02:51:28.730 --> 02:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
the budget also include the um the
 
02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
district special education costs that it
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
covers for students who attend charter
 
02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:35.510 align:start position:0%
covers for students who attend charter
schools

02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
um that that is a good there would be if
 
02:51:39.290 --> 02:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's a cost to the district I would
 
02:51:42.110 --> 02:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
assume it would okay oh would and a
 
02:51:44.450 --> 02:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so so would the
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
denominator in this in this simple
 
02:51:51.530 --> 02:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
um um equation also include the um the
 
02:51:53.809 --> 02:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
number of students that attend charter
 
02:51:53.819 --> 02:51:55.610 align:start position:0%
number of students that attend charter
schools

02:51:55.610 --> 02:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
if if I assume that whether they attend
 
02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
the charter school or home school I
 
02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
would say it would because we have to
 
02:52:04.849 --> 02:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
include them as well in our budget okay
 
02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative uh Porter and then
 
02:52:12.889 --> 02:52:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield thank you Mr
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
chair and again thank you Mr Slater sure
 
02:52:17.929 --> 02:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
um I served on my school board for one
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
term and it's a number of years ago so
 
02:52:21.170 --> 02:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting how the budgeting worked
 
02:52:23.330 --> 02:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
but I know we got a significant amount
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
of federal money that came in that we
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
used is that money that Federal money
 
02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
that comes in is that part of the budget
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
figure that people are voting on
 
02:52:37.309 --> 02:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying the yes or grants that
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
we've recently got that's right but
 
02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's other things too that would come
 
02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
in that were part of our budget paid for
 
02:52:44.330 --> 02:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
are they included in our Revenue they
 
02:52:49.130 --> 02:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
are are they included in and then
 
02:52:51.170 --> 02:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
expending them is included in the
 
02:52:54.429 --> 02:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures so if that budget figure
 
02:52:56.750 --> 02:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
includes Federal money
 
02:52:59.690 --> 02:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
that is not going to be taxpayer money
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
also included in your cost per pupil it
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
would be yes okay yeah that's how we
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
arrive at our budget as the revenue is
 
02:53:12.530 --> 02:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
offset and then that breaks down what
 
02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
02:53:13.859 --> 02:53:15.710 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
are

02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh representing you know our tax dollars
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
and then is all added in for our total
 
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
budget and we would break that down per
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
student but that would that not give you
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
an inflated opinion about what was being
 
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
spent per student if the money was not
 
02:53:33.469 --> 02:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
coming from taxes I mean I I presume
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
your issue here is to let people know
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
how much tax revenue how much your of
 
02:53:40.730 --> 02:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
your taxes how much is costing you per
 
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
student but if it's Federal money or
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
state money that's not directly being
 
02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
paid by your taxes but it would be
 
02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
included in your figure that that's a
 
02:53:51.530 --> 02:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
fair question and and that's a great
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
point you could you could do it at that
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
formula you could say whatever the what
 
02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
the rate is you know on the taxpayers
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is our cost per student I think
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do here is just
 
02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
what the overall cost is for student
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
Pursuit uh per Community all in okay
 
02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:11.929 --> 02:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent Litchfield do you
 
02:54:13.969 --> 02:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.650 --> 02:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
rather than this being placed into law
 
02:54:24.590 --> 02:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
where we are mandating that this has to
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
be in a war article could this message
 
02:54:29.809 --> 02:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
be complete conveyed at the deliberative
 
02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
session and or the town or School
 
02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
District meeting
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
it that that is definitely uh should be
 
02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
done at that time as well but it would
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
be nice for the people that aren't
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
attending the deliberative we don't as
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of towns don't get much
 
02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
activity at the deliberative sessions or
 
02:54:49.550 --> 02:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
even budget we have our public hearing
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
tonight we may have 20 people in in the
 
02:54:55.250 --> 02:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
town come to the public hearing tonight
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
to go to the deliverive so we just
 
02:54:59.809 --> 02:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
looking at this if the number was there
 
02:55:02.690 --> 02:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
when they go to vote they they see
 
02:55:05.090 --> 02:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
exactly what that cost is per student is
 
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:12.469 align:start position:0%
yes
just

02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
if a question representative Porter had
 
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that I
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
understand so the number that is on the
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
Warren article let's say for example
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
this coming year in March that is the
 
02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
number that needs to be raised and
 
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the following school
 
02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:28.429 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the following school
year

02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
that number is just including expenses
 
02:55:34.849 --> 02:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
it is not including any type of revenues
 
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
as she mentioned
 
02:55:40.010 --> 02:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that number possibly be off
 
02:55:42.050 --> 02:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
because for example special education if
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
you have someone that could potentially
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
be 250 000 could we be getting federal
 
02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
aid or could we even be getting Medicare
 
02:55:51.410 --> 02:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid payments excuse me plan and
 
02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
then you would look at the deductions of
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue off of that to come to your tax
 
02:55:58.849 --> 02:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
rate for the for the community
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you
 
02:56:02.929 --> 02:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett famous share is a
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor am I allowed to ask one quick
 
02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
question of this uh of the speaker
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're not presenting are you uh no go
 
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
02:56:15.889 --> 02:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for being
 
02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
here uh again as a co-sponsor obviously
 
02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'm very much for transparency and
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this uh which is
 
02:56:25.490 --> 02:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
why I signed on but my question if you
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
could clarify this for all of us in
 
02:56:29.809 --> 02:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
terms of cost per student if there's a
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
warrant article that is for a new roof
 
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
for the building that uh is pretty easy
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
to understand that that is a cost per
 
02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
student that affects every student if
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's a Warren article for new band
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
uniforms say uh
 
02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the intent of this uh and
 
02:56:48.769 --> 02:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
I know there's an amendment the intent
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
is to divide is is uh has been said all
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
the students into the cost of the Warren
 
02:56:57.889 --> 02:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
article but if the only beneficiaries of
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
the Warren article of the band members
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
would this not should this not be
 
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
divided by just the band members as
 
02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
opposed to the whole student body can
 
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
you clarify that a little bit
 
02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:10.429 align:start position:0%
you clarify that a little bit
um

02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:13.730 --> 02:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
and and In fairness nobody knows this at
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
the time and it's it comes out of the
 
02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:16.730 align:start position:0%
the time and it's it comes out of the
budget

02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
so whether it's the band section there's
 
02:57:22.130 --> 02:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of other areas that certain
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
students or or Falcon faculty will not
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
touch of that budget but it's an overall
 
02:57:30.050 --> 02:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
budget for the school district to
 
02:57:33.469 --> 02:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
operate so in simple math everybody pays
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of for everybody to be able
 
02:57:37.809 --> 02:57:37.819 align:start position:0%
to be educated and do co-curricular
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
activities or sports or whatever it may
 
02:57:43.849 --> 02:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
be so for simple math that's what it
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
takes to run the budget whether someone
 
02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
does sports or or does band everybody in
 
02:57:52.250 --> 02:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
their own way is is paying with this
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
with tax dollars got it thank you
 
02:57:58.190 --> 02:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
very much are there further questions
 
02:57:59.630 --> 02:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming here
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
today thank you Mr chairman
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh Barrett Christine of the School Board
 
02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:15.469 align:start position:0%
uh Barrett Christine of the School Board
Association

02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd good morning
 
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
again is it still morning just under the
 
02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
wire I think
 
02:58:26.090 --> 02:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
um nhsba is opposed to House Bill 1276
 
02:58:27.769 --> 02:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
and I do have a copy of the amendment
 
02:58:29.450 --> 02:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
here first I would like to as always
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank Mr Slater for his work on his
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
local school board we certainly
 
02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
02:58:36.889 --> 02:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
um a couple different points I hear the
 
02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
word transparency
 
02:58:39.650 --> 02:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
um being used as one of the
 
02:58:41.929 --> 02:58:41.939 align:start position:0%
justifications for this
 
02:58:44.330 --> 02:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
um to the extent um that that is a
 
02:58:47.210 --> 02:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
driving uh desire behind this bill and
 
02:58:49.250 --> 02:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
to the extent this committee can make um
 
02:58:52.910 --> 02:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
a uh an amendment that impacts towns we
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
would also ask that towns then be
 
02:58:56.510 --> 02:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
included to this and the cost per
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
resident of that town
 
02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
um be included on the warrant article if
 
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
transparency is good for school board
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
that should be good for all elected
 
02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:04.979 align:start position:0%
officials so why school boards are being
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
singled out here I don't necessarily
 
02:59:06.660 --> 02:59:08.030 align:start position:0%
singled out here I don't necessarily
know

02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Moffett you asked the
 
02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:11.210 align:start position:0%
um representative Moffett you asked the
question

02:59:11.210 --> 02:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:59:12.769 --> 02:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of I was asking you know
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
if if we're putting a 500 000 hours to
 
02:59:18.650 --> 02:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
do a roof what does that have to do with
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil and you asked on the
 
02:59:23.210 --> 02:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
question about the band uniforms my
 
02:59:25.370 --> 02:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
larger concern was about
 
02:59:26.929 --> 02:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
um school districts raising and
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
appropriating 25 000 to put in a special
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
education trust fund are we going to
 
02:59:33.710 --> 02:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
figure that out for just those special
 
02:59:35.929 --> 02:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
education kids if so
 
02:59:37.849 --> 02:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
um I would find that a little unseemly
 
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
to be quite to be quite honest with you
 
02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
so um you know I think some of the
 
02:59:44.090 --> 02:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
language is a little bit I know there's
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
a definition of budget in RSA 32 colon
 
02:59:50.570 --> 02:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
I think it's three
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
um but your budget for purposes of RSA
 
02:59:55.849 --> 02:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
32 is different than your than your
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
budget your budget includes Federal
 
03:00:00.590 --> 03:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
money grants things of that nature
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
whereas your budget for RSA 32 is you
 
03:00:04.610 --> 03:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
know your money that's being raised
 
03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:05.870 align:start position:0%
know your money that's being raised
locally

03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
locally
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and being monies of being raised and
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated locally so
 
03:00:12.050 --> 03:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
um those are on hsba's concerns with
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
this RSA 32 is intended to apply to all
 
03:00:19.969 --> 03:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
local government towns Village districts
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
school districts so carving out these
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions or these Provisions solely
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
for school districts I don't think fits
 
03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
into the scope of intent excuse me of
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 it should apply equally to towns
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
Village districts water districts and
 
03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
whatever else
 
03:00:37.670 --> 03:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and then again concerns about
 
03:00:39.650 --> 03:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
um you know the cost per pupil of the
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
band uniforms or the special education
 
03:00:44.210 --> 03:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
trust fund or improvements for the
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
football you know the football field or
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so with that I'm
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
happy answer any questions
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of a Barrett
 
03:00:55.849 --> 03:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
Barrett I have one question for you
 
03:00:59.150 --> 03:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education puts out
 
03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
every District every each year has to
 
03:01:04.370 --> 03:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
submit the doe 25 form correct which
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
reflects your assets your expenditures
 
03:01:07.849 --> 03:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
and your revenues
 
03:01:11.389 --> 03:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
they also reflect a cost per pupil
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
would that be a better figure if a
 
03:01:15.889 --> 03:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
figure is released to what it costs to
 
03:01:18.650 --> 03:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
educate a student in District a district
 
03:01:20.990 --> 03:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
B whatever thank you for the question
 
03:01:23.690 --> 03:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative one of nhsba's long
 
03:01:26.269 --> 03:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
standing frustrations with the use of
 
03:01:29.630 --> 03:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil for any determination is
 
03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
that it does there's a difference
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
between a cost per pupil and a cost to
 
03:01:34.130 --> 03:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
educate a child
 
03:01:36.290 --> 03:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
your cost per pupil includes your
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
gasoline your heating oil
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
the roof maintenance
 
03:01:42.170 --> 03:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
um your payments of New Hampshire
 
03:01:44.450 --> 03:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
retirement system things of that nature
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
it does not reflect the true cost of
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually educated child
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about the cost to
 
03:01:52.250 --> 03:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
educated child
 
03:01:53.929 --> 03:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
guess we're talking about adequacy Aid
 
03:01:56.510 --> 03:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's in 3 700 bucks a kid for the
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
state's determinations all the other
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that it takes to operate a school
 
03:02:02.809 --> 03:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
district does not necessarily mean we're
 
03:02:05.170 --> 03:02:05.180 align:start position:0%
educating a child so I
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
apologize when I need to get that off my
 
03:02:10.010 --> 03:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
chest if you're looking for a static
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
number a stable number I think yeah I
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
mean go to go with some dra reporting
 
03:02:17.570 --> 03:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
form or the ms-25 or things of that
 
03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
nature but if we're going to talk about
 
03:02:20.570 --> 03:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil we're going to talk about
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
cost to educated child those are two
 
03:02:24.110 --> 03:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
very different things
 
03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
yes they are any further questions for
 
03:02:27.779 --> 03:02:29.510 align:start position:0%
yes they are any further questions for
Barrett

03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Barrett
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
you very much sir do we have any other
 
03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close this
 
03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:37.610 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close this
hearing

03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
hearing
yes

03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:49.790 --> 03:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
you have it
 
03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:01.250 --> 03:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
is that the only one we haven't done or
 
03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is Eric power I
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
live in Brookline I served on the
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board for Hollis
 
03:03:09.769 --> 03:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
Brookline for a three-year term
 
03:03:13.370 --> 03:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm in favor of this bill I'm also
 
03:03:15.889 --> 03:03:15.899 align:start position:0%
here representing the school district
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
governance Association of New Hampshire
 
03:03:19.370 --> 03:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president
 
03:03:21.889 --> 03:03:21.899 align:start position:0%
we're an organization that seeks
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
responsible governance of academic
 
03:03:25.570 --> 03:03:25.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity with accountability
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
transparency choice and fiscal prudence
 
03:03:31.550 --> 03:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really important bill
 
03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
because it provides transparency to the
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
voters and you you know I know that
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's presentations out there and
 
03:03:40.010 --> 03:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
there's information on websites but
 
03:03:41.330 --> 03:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Voters that out there
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
that either come to a traditional
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and are looking for information
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
and all they see is the warrant
 
03:03:51.230 --> 03:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
or you have voters that come to the
 
03:03:52.969 --> 03:03:52.979 align:start position:0%
deliberative session see the warrant and
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
then in the sb2 towns we have in school
 
03:03:58.370 --> 03:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
districts we have the sb2 ballot which
 
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
has the only thing some people see if
 
03:04:01.610 --> 03:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
they just if they don't go to the
 
03:04:04.370 --> 03:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
deliberative session so making this
 
03:04:06.830 --> 03:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
information present on the warrant I
 
03:04:08.570 --> 03:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
think is really important because I
 
03:04:10.370 --> 03:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of Voters that's what
 
03:04:12.650 --> 03:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
they see and that they make decisions on
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
that so having this information
 
03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
available is very uh it helps spread the
 
03:04:20.690 --> 03:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
information increases transparency
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
I know that I talk to people around town
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
and I said you know we're spending
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
twenty three thousand dollars a student
 
03:04:28.670 --> 03:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
like what they don't really understand
 
03:04:31.849 --> 03:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
that that number and you get the
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
argument about what the Department of
 
03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
Education says well they only say we
 
03:04:38.030 --> 03:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
spend sixteen thousand but the the truth
 
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
is is that the costs that the taxpayer
 
03:04:42.590 --> 03:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
is actually 23 it's how much money are
 
03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
we raising and appropriating divided by
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
the number of students average daily
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
membership reported to Doe
 
03:04:50.690 --> 03:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
then you say well you're getting
 
03:04:52.130 --> 03:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
revenues from the state and the federal
 
03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:52.969 align:start position:0%
revenues from the state and the federal
government

03:04:52.969 --> 03:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
what I'd say that's also our money too
 
03:04:57.170 --> 03:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
we've paid the taxes that's money we
 
03:04:58.610 --> 03:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
paid to the federal government we pay to
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
the state government we pay locally so
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's really all of our money so I think
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
to take that out and say it's not
 
03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
something you have to worry about I
 
03:05:08.210 --> 03:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
don't think makes sense
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to mention that tax impact
 
03:05:14.929 --> 03:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
is uh not mandatory on School District
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
warrants it's something you have to vote
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
to actually put on there some
 
03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
school districts put it on there by good
 
03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:23.570 align:start position:0%
school districts put it on there by good
practice

03:05:23.570 --> 03:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:05:25.370 --> 03:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
um in Brookline we did a petition Warren
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
article and got it passed last year so
 
03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
this year they have to put it on they
 
03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put it on so there's a
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
resistance to show how much things cost
 
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I think making it mandatory or at
 
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
least making it enabling legislation as
 
03:05:39.889 --> 03:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
originally proposed is important
 
03:05:39.899 --> 03:05:42.110 align:start position:0%
originally proposed is important
um

03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say also that um
 
03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
I did send in a uh to the chair and vice
 
03:05:49.130 --> 03:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
chair I sent some suggested language
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
changes to this bill potentially to make
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation just like the
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
others were proposing and also for your
 
03:05:58.250 --> 03:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
consideration when you get to Executive
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
session having enabling legislation so
 
03:06:03.290 --> 03:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
that you could actually publish the
 
03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education proficiency
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
numbers for the highest grade in the
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
school district under the idea of how
 
03:06:10.849 --> 03:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
much is it costing and how much are we
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
getting increasing transparency I think
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's a very good thing for people to
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
see I think that helps people make
 
03:06:18.889 --> 03:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
informed decisions how much are we
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
spending and what are we getting for it
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
using a metric that is measurable every
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
year and use the last grade that's
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
reported because that's the one sort of
 
03:06:29.210 --> 03:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
the terminal grade so like grade 11 in a
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know a 7 through 12 School
 
03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:33.050 align:start position:0%
uh you know a 7 through 12 School
District

03:06:33.050 --> 03:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:06:33.060 --> 03:06:34.730 align:start position:0%
District
and

03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:37.490 --> 03:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so I would encourage that the the
 
03:06:39.469 --> 03:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
committee look at possible amendments
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
but also look at putting this out there
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
to help the taxpayers we have a big
 
03:06:45.170 --> 03:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
challenge here in New Hampshire where we
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
have some most places are seeing
 
03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments and we had rapidly
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
increasing School budgets this will help
 
03:06:54.290 --> 03:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
inform the voters that that they're
 
03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're spending their money in a wise
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
way and it also helps them make good
 
03:06:59.210 --> 03:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
decisions when they're whether they're
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
at a traditional meeting or they're
 
03:07:03.410 --> 03:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
voting on sb2 at The Ballot Box thank
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much uh
 
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative are you willing to take
 
03:07:09.410 --> 03:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
some questions here
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes I will okay representative Porter
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and again thank you
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
Mr power
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
um the original bill is enabling the
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is is not enabling
 
03:07:25.370 --> 03:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement that all towns school
 
03:07:27.170 --> 03:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
districts do this
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
is your intention to have it be enabling
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
or a requirement that's my first
 
03:07:31.859 --> 03:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
or a requirement that's my first
question

03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
the school district Governors
 
03:07:37.730 --> 03:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
Association wants to make it uh
 
03:07:40.370 --> 03:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh required
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I personally would be good with either
 
03:07:45.889 --> 03:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
way if it was enabling like we have for
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
tax impact now you have to vote to put
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
it on there and then the the amendment
 
03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
that we talked about make that enabling
 
03:07:53.450 --> 03:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
where you would choose the school
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
district would choose or not to report
 
03:07:58.370 --> 03:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
the proficiency scores
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little confused
 
03:08:03.290 --> 03:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
um so then could you tell me again the
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
name of your organization and where I
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
might be able to find information about
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's where you get your funding and
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
things like that we are an all volunteer
 
03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:14.050 align:start position:0%
things like that we are an all volunteer
organization

03:08:14.050 --> 03:08:14.060 align:start position:0%

03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay we'll come back and start at one

03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
pretty tough to get some of these
 
03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
figures they want you know I I think
 
03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
people need to be aware what it's
 
03:09:09.660 --> 03:09:11.090 align:start position:0%
people need to be aware what it's
costing

03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
costing
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
but we kind of get kind of some kind of
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
system where it's done uniformly
 
03:09:16.610 --> 03:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the state or else it's going
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.819 --> 04:01:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%

Region
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
um HB 1298 is a very simple program
 
04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
the tax credit scholarship program has
 
04:06:38.090 --> 04:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
been in existence for going on uh 10
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
years and there have been a growing
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
number of similar programs around the
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
country a number of them I think
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
something like a half a dozen just in
 
04:06:50.450 --> 04:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
the past years have been implemented in
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
this legislation makes one very simple
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
change uh changes one digit it changes
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent family income cap to 500
 
04:07:09.849 --> 04:07:09.859 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty guidelines
 
04:07:14.410 --> 04:07:14.420 align:start position:0%
up until now it has been 300 percent
 
04:07:18.650 --> 04:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
and concentrating really on lower income
 
04:07:18.660 --> 04:07:19.929 align:start position:0%
and concentrating really on lower income
families

04:07:19.929 --> 04:07:19.939 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:07:22.969 --> 04:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
but as with way too many government
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
programs we forget people who might be
 
04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
categorized as lower middle income
 
04:07:29.340 --> 04:07:31.269 align:start position:0%
categorized as lower middle income
families

04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
I believe that they should have the
 
04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity as well to find the best
 
04:07:41.570 --> 04:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
education option to meet their child's
 
04:07:41.580 --> 04:07:42.710 align:start position:0%
education option to meet their child's
needs

04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
and with the new education Freedom
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
accounts legislation that went into
 
04:07:50.809 --> 04:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
effect this past summer
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
the one
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
problem that has been communicated to me
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
about the program is the income cap
 
04:08:04.849 --> 04:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
um so rather than uh deal with an income
 
04:08:08.150 --> 04:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
cap and a brand new program I thought it
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
was wiser to take a look at this program
 
04:08:14.450 --> 04:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
and raise the income cap here as this
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
program is well established
 
04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll remind everybody that this is
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
based on donations to the tax credit
 
04:08:29.689 --> 04:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and uh in return the
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
business or the family would get a tax
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
credit against their income there is no
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
government money involved in this
 
04:08:40.729 --> 04:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
program at all
 
04:08:40.739 --> 04:08:42.229 align:start position:0%
program at all
um

04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:46.729 --> 04:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
in the past year the report issued by
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
the scholarship children's Scholarship
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
Foundation they have to add issue an
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
annual report to the Department of
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration for anyone who
 
04:09:00.889 --> 04:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
wants a copy I have some here
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
but there were 640 scholarships uh
 
04:09:05.520 --> 04:09:06.710 align:start position:0%
but there were 640 scholarships uh
issued

04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
based on the donations to the fund and
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
in law 40 percent of those scholarships
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
have to be for people for children who
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
qualify for free and reduced lunch which
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
is a family income of 185 percent of
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
federal poverty or less
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
but in actuality in 2021 school year
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
63 percent
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the scholarships issued went to uh
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
families act that 185 percent of federal
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
poverty or less
 
04:09:43.800 --> 04:09:45.950 align:start position:0%
poverty or less
so

04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
the point I think it's in the fiscal
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
note from the Department of Revenue
 
04:09:51.300 --> 04:09:52.729 align:start position:0%
note from the Department of Revenue
Administration

04:09:52.729 --> 04:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
the number and amount of scholarships
 
04:09:59.210 --> 04:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
awarded is a function of the amount of
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
the donations received that's very
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
important and if you look at the fact
 
04:10:06.889 --> 04:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement for 40
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
percent free and reduced scholarships
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
but 63 of the scholarships went to those
 
04:10:16.729 --> 04:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
families I I think that if there is any
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
04:10:21.070 --> 04:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
um uh wealthier families getting
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
scholarships uh I think it is uh not a
 
04:10:27.729 --> 04:10:27.739 align:start position:0%
real concern I think that
 
04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
scholarships will go to uh people with
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
lower family income
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
so uh I would ask you to um consider
 
04:10:43.610 --> 04:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
raising this cap and providing funds for
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
some of those families who are looking
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
for assistance for their children to
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
find a better education and who possibly
 
04:10:56.929 --> 04:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
don't meet the current 300 percent of
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
federal poverty figure for either the
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts or this tax
 
04:11:04.610 --> 04:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for your attention
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:11:13.610 --> 04:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
cordelli a question representative walls
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so if the money is primarily going to
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
low-income students why is it we need to
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
raise the cap
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh I am hopeful that
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
um the number and amount of donations
 
04:11:31.370 --> 04:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
will grow in the future providing the
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
ability uh for uh scholarships to be
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
awarded to uh families whose income is
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
108 000 per year
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
at the top the marker for the top 20
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
percent of income earners in the US
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
right now is 20 so you were raising it
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that the family the income earning
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
cap is going to be probably so probably
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the top
 
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
up to anybody except the top 19 percent
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
of earners will now be eligible for this
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
so when you say it's not going to higher
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
income people by raising it to the 500
 
04:12:13.849 --> 04:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
level by breaking that 20 threshold
 
04:12:16.370 --> 04:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
isn't that then allowing higher income
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
earners to take advantage of this credit
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
um again the number of scholarships
 
04:12:21.840 --> 04:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
um again the number of scholarships
awarded

04:12:23.090 --> 04:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
um is based on the amount of donations
 
04:12:25.739 --> 04:12:27.769 align:start position:0%
um is based on the amount of donations
received

04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
received
 
04:12:30.110 --> 04:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
um it's not you know anyone who
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
qualifies uh excuse me anyone who
 
04:12:34.969 --> 04:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
applies can get a scholarship
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and also um when I looked at the
 
04:12:44.450 --> 04:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
census bureaus American Community survey
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
five-year average for 2019 it appeared
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:12:54.849 --> 04:12:54.859 align:start position:0%
income threshold of 500 percent
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
04:13:00.670 --> 04:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
would exclude about
 
04:13:04.250 --> 04:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
one-third of New Hampshire families so
 
04:13:07.490 --> 04:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
the qualifying I'm not sure where the 19
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
percent came from but for New Hampshire
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:11.650 align:start position:0%
it looks like
um

04:13:11.650 --> 04:13:11.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:14.330 --> 04:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
one-third of families would not meet
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
this new income cap to answer your
 
04:13:18.170 --> 04:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
question it's based on the federal
 
04:13:20.210 --> 04:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
numbers where the threshold on the
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
national level for the top 20 percent of
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
earners is one hundred thousand dollars
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
so by breaking that one hundred thousand
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
dollar Threshold at least on a national
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
level you're allowing people in that top
 
04:13:33.050 --> 04:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
20 percent to qualify for the
 
04:13:33.060 --> 04:13:34.490 align:start position:0%
20 percent to qualify for the
scholarship

04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
again my my numbers we're looking at the
 
04:13:39.290 --> 04:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire figures for the five-year
 
04:13:40.729 --> 04:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
average from the American Community
 
04:13:40.739 --> 04:13:43.130 align:start position:0%
average from the American Community
survey

04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
04:13:46.849 --> 04:13:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we all have different
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
numbers here because I looked at the
 
04:13:51.769 --> 04:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level for 2021 for a
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
family of four and the federal poverty
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
level is 26 500 according to them and if
 
04:14:00.170 --> 04:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
you take 500 percent of that would bring
 
04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
the family a four income up to 132 500
 
04:14:06.650 --> 04:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
so we have all different figures going
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
around that's the number that I uh found
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
as well okay so um my second question is
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
you said that you were hoping that um
 
04:14:18.410 --> 04:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
you'd get more contributions however one
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that people can
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
contribute is a percentage of their um
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax and that's
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
being phased out the New Hampshire
 
04:14:34.370 --> 04:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
budget so that would indicate that those
 
04:14:35.929 --> 04:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
people would not be able to contribute
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
any longer where do you see anticipate
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
the increased funding coming from uh yes
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
you're correct um I think it's a
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
five-year phase out of
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
um that interest in dividends tax
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
so those people no longer be donating to
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
the scholarship fund
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
04:14:59.290 --> 04:14:59.300 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that businesses
 
04:15:01.969 --> 04:15:01.979 align:start position:0%
will be contributing more and I think
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh honestly the um
 
04:15:10.010 --> 04:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
maybe Scholarship Foundation and and
 
04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
others can make businesses aware of uh
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
the program and increase donations that
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
way I think that there is
 
04:15:21.889 --> 04:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
um uh or a lack of information to some
 
04:15:23.570 --> 04:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
businesses around the state that this
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Tanner
 
04:15:31.610 --> 04:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is the
 
04:15:33.290 --> 04:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
giving and going Alliance still part of
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
this tax credit scholarship
 
04:15:35.640 --> 04:15:37.849 align:start position:0%
this tax credit scholarship
organization

04:15:37.849 --> 04:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:15:42.010 --> 04:15:42.020 align:start position:0%
um I think that that is a a
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
registered group with the uh dra but I
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
think that their funds are their
 
04:15:53.689 --> 04:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
programs administered for them by the uh
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
CSF the scholarship children's
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
they are a registered program with the
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
ra for this yes I believe so
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh director of the children's
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund could not be here today
 
04:16:18.650 --> 04:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
because I'm an ill child but um we can
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
have that confirmed
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes so what was the pool of
 
04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh because I believe your report is from
 
04:16:32.040 --> 04:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
uh because I believe your report is from
2020.

04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%

04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%

um

04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.650 --> 04:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
and my apologies it looks like there
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
might be a page missing from
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the copies that were made
 
04:17:47.330 --> 04:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
yes I don't seem to find out what the
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
page page two is missing I'm sorry what
 
04:17:54.530 --> 04:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
I I will send electronic copy of the
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:18:05.290 --> 04:18:05.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:18:07.969 --> 04:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for hopefully giving me some
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
a a parent is currently involved in the
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
voucher program
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
are they eligible for this as well
 
04:18:22.010 --> 04:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the education Freedom account program
 
04:18:24.050 --> 04:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
you're referring to yes
 
04:18:24.060 --> 04:18:26.269 align:start position:0%
you're referring to yes
um

04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.279 --> 04:18:27.769 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:18:27.769 --> 04:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
I would have to go back and look at the
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh final version of the education
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
um in the uh the house version that did
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
not uh get passed I think that they were
 
04:18:41.570 --> 04:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
eligible for both
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure uh the final version
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that is now in law I'd have to go back
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
and check that
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
that further further question
 
04:18:51.239 --> 04:18:53.150 align:start position:0%
that further further question
representative

04:18:53.150 --> 04:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
yeah it's more a point of order I've
 
04:18:57.290 --> 04:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
been giving to the Scholarship
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
Foundation from its very beginning and
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
we did not it was not at at that time
 
04:19:05.450 --> 04:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
allowing for anything other than
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
businesses to get the tax credit we
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
didn't do it for the tax credit so I was
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
just saying that anybody can give to
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
this the tax credit incentivizes people
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
to do so but anybody can and I would
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly uh recommend to anybody
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
because the con the kids who get this
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
are okay what we all knew that needs to
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
really be a question to the presenter
 
04:19:33.130 --> 04:19:33.140 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes I did
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh you are correct um uh I
 
04:19:39.170 --> 04:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
probably should have pointed that out
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
because uh we also have uh donated uh
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.170 --> 04:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
trying to get the my other part of the
 
04:19:48.180 --> 04:19:50.689 align:start position:0%
trying to get the my other part of the
question

04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
there are limits oh
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
a level uh for businesses
 
04:19:56.279 --> 04:19:57.650 align:start position:0%
a level uh for businesses
uh

04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
I do not recall uh seeing that but um I
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
will double check that as well there is
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
a total I think there is a total yes
 
04:20:09.050 --> 04:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
there is yes
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
for a business for all the program okay
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay so so I just want to get
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
back to my actually get to my question I
 
04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
have the fact thank you in the
 
04:20:20.520 --> 04:20:22.929 align:start position:0%
have the fact thank you in the
background

04:20:22.929 --> 04:20:22.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
for one thing
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
for representative Tanner's benefit
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
right now RSA 77 is not in the statutes
 
04:20:31.849 --> 04:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
rehab right here one of the things that
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
you talked about the other day
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent thank you if I could
 
04:20:38.809 --> 04:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
um just um I was just handing a sheet of
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
paper from the Department of Revenue
 
04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
Administration and it says not more than
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
one million dollars uh in any given tax
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
year for each business each business yes
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
so I want to understand this correctly
 
04:20:55.130 --> 04:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
in the program the the program that
 
04:20:57.650 --> 04:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
benefits from that of the company
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
is losing that over the next five year
 
04:21:01.849 --> 04:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
period of the phase out
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.060 --> 04:21:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
if I there's a company contribute up to
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a year to the tax
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
credit to go to this program
 
04:21:19.969 --> 04:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
now indeed I'm sorry the donation goes
 
04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
to this program and you can get 85
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
percent tax credit on that amount that
 
04:21:27.050 --> 04:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
you donate okay so my so my question is
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
it your comment of it's not doesn't cost
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
the state anything
 
04:21:34.610 --> 04:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
because it costs the state up to one
 
04:21:36.530 --> 04:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year per thing if
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
they go that far is that correct no okay
 
04:21:41.929 --> 04:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
um that's that's
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
um that money uh never goes to the state
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
deduct that that all is not going to is
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
going to go to the state in any way
 
04:21:57.530 --> 04:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
shape or form it could be used for uh
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
investment it could be donated to other
 
04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh Charities and so forth so
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that um it is uh uh been
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
found by the courts that that is not uh
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
government money in any way shape or
 
04:22:12.479 --> 04:22:13.490 align:start position:0%
government money in any way shape or
form

04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
form
 
04:22:15.650 --> 04:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
you cannot assume that that money would
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
go to the government
 
04:22:18.239 --> 04:22:21.410 align:start position:0%
go to the government
okay

04:22:21.410 --> 04:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:21.420 --> 04:22:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
Allison

04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh assuming that your
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
your projection or your hope that
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
the amount of money does not grow in
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
this fund
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
and we move the threshold up to 500
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
percent would there be families who
 
04:22:46.189 --> 04:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
would qualify under the current 300
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
percent who would not be receiving money
 
04:22:50.210 --> 04:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
because some of that money which is
 
04:22:52.610 --> 04:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
going to be the same amount is now going
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
to families that are making up to 132
 
04:22:56.399 --> 04:22:57.170 align:start position:0%
to families that are making up to 132
000

04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that would be the
 
04:22:59.160 --> 04:23:02.050 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that would be the
case

04:23:02.050 --> 04:23:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.060 --> 04:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:05.870 align:start position:0%
yes
uh

04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:07.849 --> 04:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
well let me follow
 
04:23:10.010 --> 04:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
if you've got the same amount of money
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
and you've got more families applying
 
04:23:15.050 --> 04:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
for it because now the threshold goes up
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
to 500 percent
 
04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
are there going to be families that
 
04:23:20.809 --> 04:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
would now qualify it seems to me if
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
you've got more the same amount of money
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
and more families are going to be some
 
04:23:25.250 --> 04:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
families who aren't going to qualify are
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to get less money is that was that
 
04:23:27.359 --> 04:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
going to get less money is that was that
correct

04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh I don't know if I'd
 
04:23:31.800 --> 04:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh I don't know if I'd
agree

04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:23:36.889 --> 04:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
you're hypothetical that the amount of
 
04:23:39.170 --> 04:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
money going into the scholarship fund
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
being donated to the scholarship fund is
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
not going to increase at all
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
and that there will be more applications
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
um maybe due to this bill I
 
04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a hypothetical
 
04:23:56.570 --> 04:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
assumption that I wouldn't necessarily
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for further questions
 
04:24:03.610 --> 04:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mullen
 
04:24:05.689 --> 04:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:24:08.450 --> 04:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative sure in uh quickly
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking over the report that you just
 
04:24:12.769 --> 04:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
shared with us
 
04:24:15.530 --> 04:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I I noticed there's a page in which
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
it States minimum and maximum
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
contribution distribution
 
04:24:25.370 --> 04:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh of scholarship funds for instance uh
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
at Acton Academy which is the first on
 
04:24:30.170 --> 04:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
the list the minimum amount given in
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
you on the page that I'm on I believe so
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay so also um on this page there's an
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
entry for uh five thousand dollars to
 
04:24:45.889 --> 04:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
Kimball Union Academy and it's one
 
04:24:48.110 --> 04:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship so I'm assuming that that's
 
04:24:51.170 --> 04:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
one student who received that I'm
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can tell me
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
what's what are the qualifying criteria
 
04:25:00.889 --> 04:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
that would have one student get five
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and uh a student at
 
04:25:07.330 --> 04:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
Nashua Catholic get
 
04:25:10.330 --> 04:25:10.340 align:start position:0%
174.38 cents I mean how is that
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
determination made between who's getting
 
04:25:13.319 --> 04:25:16.189 align:start position:0%
determination made between who's getting
what

04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.199 --> 04:25:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:25:18.110 --> 04:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if uh someone behind me can
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
answer that but um I think there are
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
Provisions in statute um related to that
 
04:25:29.210 --> 04:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
um including there's a required average
 
04:25:32.570 --> 04:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
um scholarship amount that's in statute
 
04:25:35.689 --> 04:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
um as well as looking at uh family
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
income and uh
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
um the cost of uh scholarship excuse me
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
cost of uh an education option that
 
04:25:46.490 --> 04:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
they're looking at I think there are
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
different factors that are weighed in
 
04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
is this the next card right here thank
 
04:26:04.439 --> 04:26:05.570 align:start position:0%
is this the next card right here thank

04:26:20.330 --> 04:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
04:26:24.050 --> 04:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony here
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
today my name is Sarah Scott and I'm the
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
director of Grassroots operations with
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire
 
04:26:35.210 --> 04:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of AFP New Hampshire and
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
our activists all across the state I
 
04:26:39.670 --> 04:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
want to urge you to support House Bill
 
04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
1298 a bill which would provide an
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more Granite State
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
students to access a personalized
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
education by increasing the eligibility
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for the education tax
 
04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
especially over the last couple of years
 
04:26:57.410 --> 04:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
we've seen so many families taking
 
04:26:59.689 --> 04:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
advantage of new and Innovative
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
education options for their kids whether
 
04:27:04.729 --> 04:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
it be remote learning micro schools
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
within their local public school pods
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
within their neighborhood or
 
04:27:11.570 --> 04:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
homeschooling families have had such
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
varying needs and are really going to
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
continue to and students are finding
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
environments that better fit their
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
learning style many of these families
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
would not have had the opportunity to
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
pursue these options if it weren't for
 
04:27:26.450 --> 04:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit program
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
so in talking with a lot of the families
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
that are currently participating in the
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
program they are absolutely ecstatic to
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
have been given the chance to have their
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
children learning in an environment that
 
04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
really helps them to thrive
 
04:27:41.090 --> 04:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
these are students who struggled in
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
their old learning environments for a
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons whether it be
 
04:27:48.530 --> 04:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
bullying learning disabilities or even
 
04:27:50.929 --> 04:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
just a difference in surroundings and
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
learning styles
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
at AFP we really believe that empowering
 
04:27:57.410 --> 04:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families with greater
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
educational options is critical to
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
giving every child the freedom to
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
discover develop and apply their talents
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
in order to find fulfillment and success
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
in their lives and since it's beginning
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
in 2013 this program has helped
 
04:28:13.969 --> 04:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
thousands of students and with this
 
04:28:15.410 --> 04:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
legislation we would have the
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand this to families
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
who are still struggling and not able to
 
04:28:21.410 --> 04:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
pursue these opportunities on their own
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
I know it was brought up earlier about
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
why the cap needed to be raised based on
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
some of these families incomes I just
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to give an example of throughout
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
the past summer when families were
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
looking at the EFA program I talked to a
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
number of families and one mother came
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
to me because her kids were struggling
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
in their current school one of her
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
daughters had been bullied pretty badly
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
and she was looking for another option
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is that unlike most people
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
throughout the first year of covid her
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
income actually went up I know for a lot
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
of folks their income went down during
 
04:29:01.250 --> 04:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
that time but for her her income went up
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
it was a one-time thing her income went
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
down again the following year but
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
because of the way the income
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
requirements work she actually misses
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
the eligibility based on fifty dollars
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
so raising the income cap would provide
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
for families like hers where she is
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
again going to qualify but not until
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
next year so this would give an
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity for those families to take
 
04:29:25.969 --> 04:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
advantage of these options and find a
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
different option for their child
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
so it's for these reasons that we ask
 
04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
that you recommend this legislation as
 
04:29:35.330 --> 04:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and allow more families to
 
04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
choose the educational environment that
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
works best for their child
 
04:29:40.610 --> 04:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:29:43.490 --> 04:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
very much Miss Scott represent Porter
 
04:29:45.050 --> 04:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Scott you might be the wrong person for
 
04:29:49.250 --> 04:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
me to ask this question but my
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
remembrance when the education tax
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
credit program went was passed that the
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
children going to other schools
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
there was um a lot of flexibility in how
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
you would measure their achievement and
 
04:30:05.210 --> 04:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
the one that I remember being the only
 
04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
one was parent satisfaction survey
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
in your statement you mentioned that
 
04:30:14.929 --> 04:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
this allows children to have better
 
04:30:17.210 --> 04:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes and I'm wondering
 
04:30:20.450 --> 04:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
do you know if there has been an
 
04:30:22.610 --> 04:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
increased um
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
a different way of measuring the
 
04:30:26.210 --> 04:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
educational achievement of the children
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
who are getting this money other than
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
just parent satisfaction survey uh thank
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
04:30:34.969 --> 04:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the scholarship
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
organization is using for that I believe
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
they have some kind of record of that
 
04:30:40.490 --> 04:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure how public it is but
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to reach out to them and
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
get you the information I would really
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
like to know like is there any kind of
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
testing that's being done like in the
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
public schools or is it just um
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
conversation that people have I believe
 
04:30:51.420 --> 04:30:52.689 align:start position:0%
conversation that people have I believe
that

04:30:52.689 --> 04:30:52.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
for the kids who are in private schools
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
they go through the regular testing that
 
04:31:00.050 --> 04:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
the school chooses for the kids that are
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
homeschooled they go through the regular
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
assessments of either a nationally
 
04:31:06.110 --> 04:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
recognized standardized test uh
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
portfolio reviewed by a certified
 
04:31:10.490 --> 04:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
teacher or the New Hampshire State
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
assessment as well
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh thank you Mr
 
04:31:17.090 --> 04:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
question uh would it be your position
 
04:31:21.410 --> 04:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
that additional students would be served
 
04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
by this program if the total donation to
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
the fund does not go up it stays level
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
uh if the total amount of money stays
 
04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
the same then I would assume that we
 
04:31:33.050 --> 04:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
can't grow the program to expand any
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
more students I don't believe the number
 
04:31:36.530 --> 04:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
would drop for those currently in the
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
program thank you
 
04:31:44.530 --> 04:31:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:47.450 --> 04:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
you may be the wrong person uh my
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
question it's about money I might be but
 
04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
you probably you may have the answer all
 
04:31:51.180 --> 04:31:51.889 align:start position:0%
you probably you may have the answer all
right

04:31:51.889 --> 04:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:31:53.809 --> 04:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
I have two questions or one question two
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
parts the first question is the
 
04:31:57.649 --> 04:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
application for the scholarship program
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
is that an annual application or is once
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
I receive a scholarship it's good every
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
year assuming I stay in that income
 
04:32:04.140 --> 04:32:05.210 align:start position:0%
year assuming I stay in that income
level

04:32:05.210 --> 04:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm nearly positive that it's
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
reviewed every year okay that's one
 
04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you may finish the circle yes
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:12.239 --> 04:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:15.889 --> 04:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
do you know if the the number of folks
 
04:32:17.570 --> 04:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
who met the criteria last year the
 
04:32:19.729 --> 04:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
income criteria and did not get
 
04:32:19.739 --> 04:32:21.290 align:start position:0%
income criteria and did not get
scholarships

04:32:21.290 --> 04:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
do I know if they met the requirement
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
but how many didn't get it yeah like the
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
wait list I'm not sure what the wait
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
list is I know that they have definitely
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
reduced the wait list over the last year
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
the program went from serving 600 kids
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
up to over a thousand so I do know that
 
04:32:39.410 --> 04:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
they increased it quite a bit I know
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
they had a waiting list of probably six
 
04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
to eight hundred students last I checked
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
so with that increase of over a thousand
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
right now I think that they have served
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
a large portion of that waiting list
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you further
 
04:32:52.080 --> 04:32:53.929 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you further
questions

04:32:53.929 --> 04:32:53.939 align:start position:0%

committee uh I have some information for

you here
 
04:45:44.208 --> 04:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
during the course of every year we
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
receive an annual report from the
 
04:45:49.368 --> 04:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Education regarding
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
bullying in the uh various schools
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
I have the annual report here I got
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
multiple copies for you I will place
 
04:46:00.890 --> 04:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
them in the office and just grab one on
 
04:46:02.930 --> 04:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
the way out there's plenty for you so
 
04:46:04.490 --> 04:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we're good with that
 
04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's also a report here on the use of
 
04:46:10.690 --> 04:46:10.700 align:start position:0%
school restraint and seclusion for the
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
2019-20 year we've got that also made
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
for you copies of it so these two
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
reports will be in the office available
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
rather than you know they're pretty
 
04:46:21.650 --> 04:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
heavy so rather than pass them all
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
around here we'll have it out there for
 
04:46:23.878 --> 04:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
around here we'll have it out there for
you

04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%

bullying is for
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
2020-21 so that's more current
 
04:46:44.090 --> 04:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
I have had a couple requests by way of
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%

04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
next bill which is HB 1676
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
relative to making incentive grants for
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
school districts that improve in certain
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
assessment scores
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr very happy to be here
 
04:47:26.810 --> 04:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
looks a little different from this seat
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is uh uh
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett for
 
04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 9. the beautiful
 
04:47:38.208 --> 04:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
towns of Canterbury and Loudoun uh so
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
very simply this measure would make
 
04:47:42.590 --> 04:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
funding available to Department of
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
Education to award uh and reward schools
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
that show Improvement
 
04:47:51.288 --> 04:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh in standardized test scores
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's intended to identify reward and
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
reinforce uh achievement
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
now currently is is most of you know we
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
provide funds that essentially uh in a
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
sense reward failure in that third grade
 
04:48:08.330 --> 04:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
or schools that have third grade test
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
scores there are lower deficient they
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
get they get money
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and I understand the logic behind
 
04:48:16.368 --> 04:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
that uh the intent being to try to help
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
schools that are that are struggling
 
04:48:22.368 --> 04:48:22.378 align:start position:0%
with with reading and yes understand the
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
intent there but uh some folks are
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
concerned that that approach is a
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
disincentive as opposed to an incentive
 
04:48:30.650 --> 04:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:48:32.510 --> 04:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
to achieve
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
so we originally drafted some language
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that identified specific assessments
 
04:48:41.770 --> 04:48:41.780 align:start position:0%
um to to use as part of this initiative
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh and also percentages of improvement
 
04:48:49.250 --> 04:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
um using 2019 scores is a Baseline
 
04:48:49.260 --> 04:48:50.990 align:start position:0%
um using 2019 scores is a Baseline
pre-pandemic

04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
but after meeting uh with a team of four
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh doe Department of Education officials
 
04:49:00.410 --> 04:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
including commissioner we opted for Less
 
04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
prescriptive language the language that
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
you see in front of you uh which will
 
04:49:09.288 --> 04:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
allow more discretion to doe to
 
04:49:12.410 --> 04:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
implement uh the concept
 
04:49:16.010 --> 04:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
and it cost a million bucks uh you know
 
04:49:18.170 --> 04:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
and there is a FN there's a financial
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
note which you see
 
04:49:22.190 --> 04:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
but knowing of all the sentiment here
 
04:49:24.410 --> 04:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere to find ways to enhance
 
04:49:27.170 --> 04:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
school funding we thought this incentive
 
04:49:29.930 --> 04:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
based the smartest very modest incentive
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
based initiative would be a good way
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
to try something Innovative that could
 
04:49:38.570 --> 04:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
reward achievement and get a little bit
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
more money to some schools and that's
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
the essence of it and I'd be happy to
 
04:49:45.050 --> 04:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
04:49:47.280 --> 04:49:48.650 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
walls

04:49:48.650 --> 04:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
walls
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.770 --> 04:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
been from the revenue stabilization
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
account which we all know is the rainy
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
day fund and if you look at section 9
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
colon 13-e Roman 3 it makes it clear
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
that the money is specifically to be
 
04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
used only when there's a revenue
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
shortfall and I'm not sure that what
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're proposing is permitted under
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
current rsas and I'm wondering if you've
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
examined that issue sure thank you
 
04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative for the question
 
04:50:19.610 --> 04:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a revenue shortfall uh
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot about Revenue
 
04:50:25.490 --> 04:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
shortfalls in in public education so
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
that I think is part of the logic behind
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh applying this in terms of there being
 
04:50:33.530 --> 04:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
a revenue shortfall and I I did we did
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
have the Folks At Doe in OLS you know
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
review all the language ahead of time so
 
04:50:42.650 --> 04:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully that kind of answers your
 
04:50:42.660 --> 04:50:44.390 align:start position:0%
hopefully that kind of answers your
question

04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes so we know it's not the job of OLS
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
to determine whether something's legal
 
04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
or constitutional they put out bills all
 
04:50:52.730 --> 04:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
the time that people requested are
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so I don't think that
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's a valid reason to view this as
 
04:51:02.090 --> 04:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
being constitutional but there is a
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty I get the revenue
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
notices several times a month there's
 
04:51:07.850 --> 04:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
over 120 million dollars in excess
 
04:51:09.410 --> 04:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's come in that's over and
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
above plan right now so I think we would
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
be very hard-pressed to say that the
 
04:51:15.170 --> 04:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
statements any sort of Revenue shortfall
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
quite the contrary the state seems to be
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
Awash in money right now have you seen
 
04:51:21.310 --> 04:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
those numbers and are you aware of that
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you representative very
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
aware of the the revenues
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
um overall that the state has in fact as
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
they come in we're hearing some nice
 
04:51:34.128 --> 04:51:34.138 align:start position:0%
reports uh in terms of some of the
 
04:51:37.550 --> 04:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues coming in
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the the notes which I already
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the notion of a revenue
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
shortfall uh has to do with uh the
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
education Community uh again uh I pray
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
we've all heard that there is uh
 
04:51:54.530 --> 04:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
you know trying to find ways to find a
 
04:51:56.208 --> 04:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
little bit of extra money here there or
 
04:51:59.448 --> 04:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
however to send in the way of public
 
04:51:59.458 --> 04:52:01.730 align:start position:0%
however to send in the way of public
education

04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and this is a way that we saw is
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
being able to do a little bit of that
 
04:52:09.288 --> 04:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
and at the same time identifying and
 
04:52:10.970 --> 04:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
rewarding achievement
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
so the uh the ass the fiscal note has
 
04:52:19.368 --> 04:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
been addressed in the the legal piece of
 
04:52:21.770 --> 04:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
it has been looked at as well and I'm
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure it'll be continued to be looked at
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
as you're doing right now
 
04:52:27.650 --> 04:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
well I commend you for a creative
 
04:52:29.840 --> 04:52:29.850 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the RSA
 
04:52:29.850 --> 04:52:31.610 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the RSA
[Laughter]

04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:52:33.650 --> 04:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative good afternoon
 
04:52:39.288 --> 04:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
um I have I have two two points or two
 
04:52:41.690 --> 04:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
questions one question one point
 
04:52:41.700 --> 04:52:43.368 align:start position:0%
questions one question one point
um

04:52:43.368 --> 04:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
I take concern with the language of
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
talking about that we reward failure in
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
clearly we have schools that are
 
04:52:54.900 --> 04:52:56.330 align:start position:0%
clearly we have schools that are
underperforming

04:52:56.330 --> 04:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
underperforming
 
04:52:58.250 --> 04:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we were rewarding them and
 
04:52:59.448 --> 04:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
trying to help them
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
but to that extent I would ask you
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
if we really want to improve scores
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we want to with your money
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
invest more in Innovative programs or
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
Innovative programs that may help
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
schools that are already
 
04:53:18.190 --> 04:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
less funded or less successful
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
particularly when we know there's a
 
04:53:23.448 --> 04:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
correlation between schools that invest
 
04:53:25.970 --> 04:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
more money in their students and their
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
performance scores
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and in terms
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
of innovative programs first of all uh
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the notion of rewarding
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
failure that
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
that is a phrase that I've heard used a
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
lot and I would
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh stand by that in the sense as I've
 
04:53:50.690 --> 04:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
already said that clearly schools who
 
04:53:53.868 --> 04:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
have low third grade test scores get
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
more money and that's something that
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of us are not that comfortable with
 
04:53:58.080 --> 04:54:00.050 align:start position:0%
some of us are not that comfortable with
uh

04:54:00.050 --> 04:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
also you know if students are identified
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of special needs
 
04:54:06.000 --> 04:54:06.708 align:start position:0%
in terms of special needs
um

04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
that I think is something that deserves
 
04:54:14.690 --> 04:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh support and so forth
 
04:54:16.250 --> 04:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:54:18.890 --> 04:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
I think we need to look at
 
04:54:22.368 --> 04:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
when we offer funds for certain things
 
04:54:22.378 --> 04:54:23.628 align:start position:0%
when we offer funds for certain things
if

04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
we create disincentives uh and and we'll
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
once we get to exec session and down the
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
road we'll talk more about this but in
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
terms of innovative approaches uh I
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
think we think this is an Innovative
 
04:54:39.770 --> 04:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
approach to you know find some money uh
 
04:54:41.570 --> 04:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's uh
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know in accordance with doe policies
 
04:54:47.690 --> 04:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
and rules in statutes and once that's
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
done to make this money available in
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:54:56.570 --> 04:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh rewarding success
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative are you have a follow-up
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
we know from the data we've looked at
 
04:55:09.170 --> 04:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
over the last year
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
on scoring
 
04:55:13.730 --> 04:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
the schools that have the ability to
 
04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
invest more money
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
are showing a higher percentage of
 
04:55:19.920 --> 04:55:21.170 align:start position:0%
are showing a higher percentage of
proficiency

04:55:21.170 --> 04:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
04:55:24.170 --> 04:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
than schools that don't so what you're
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
saying in essence is let's give more
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
money to the school districts that
 
04:55:31.010 --> 04:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
already have more money and their kids
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
are already doing better already
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and I don't
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
see it though I think that schools would
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
be would be competing against themselves
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
they're not competing against any other
 
04:55:43.788 --> 04:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
school all they're doing is competing
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
against their own Baseline of test
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
scores so yeah I would disagree with
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
that premise I think schools are not
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
compete against each other they're just
 
04:55:56.570 --> 04:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
simply competing against themselves and
 
04:55:58.610 --> 04:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
if they improve their own test scores
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
then they'll get a reward for that is
 
04:56:04.250 --> 04:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
that one last question does that in that
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't see that in the bill it said
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
that that they're doing an analysis of
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
the annual scores and looking at an
 
04:56:13.970 --> 04:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
ingredient Improvement sure the initial
 
04:56:16.368 --> 04:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
language that we had put together is as
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
I already mentioned was was very
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptive we trying to have some good
 
04:56:23.570 --> 04:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
definition to this concept this
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
initiative and I think I already
 
04:56:27.770 --> 04:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we uh had identified
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
specific assessments and specific
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
percentages of improvement for the
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
schools to achieve in order to get up to
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
a fifty thousand dollar reward but after
 
04:56:43.128 --> 04:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
we met uh several of us met with the
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
team At Doe they looked at that proposal
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
and came back and and they asked for at
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
do we asked for this language which
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
would enable them to have some
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
discretion into how they uh developed
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
the criteria to make the awards so
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers your question
 
04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you yes it does thank you
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
represent Porter
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I have a couple
 
04:57:11.448 --> 04:57:11.458 align:start position:0%
of questions if that's okay
 
04:57:11.458 --> 04:57:13.010 align:start position:0%
of questions if that's okay
um

04:57:13.010 --> 04:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering research that I've seen
 
04:57:18.128 --> 04:57:18.138 align:start position:0%
in the last years
 
04:57:18.138 --> 04:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
in the last years
that

04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:19.920 --> 04:57:21.830 align:start position:0%
that
indicates

04:57:21.830 --> 04:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
04:57:25.390 --> 04:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
over and over that the best indicators
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
of how well a child will do on a
 
04:57:30.350 --> 04:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
standardized test
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
is the income level
 
04:57:34.850 --> 04:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
in the educational level of their
 
04:57:34.860 --> 04:57:39.170 align:start position:0%
in the educational level of their
parents

04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the second thing that I know is that in
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
places where Merit Scholarships I mean
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me Merit pay has been
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
um suggested for educators
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
Educators themselves have roundly
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
said no we don't want that because we're
 
04:58:00.650 --> 04:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
not here for competitiveness we're here
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
in your concentration looking at this
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
bill did you ever think about other
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
measures of achievement for schools
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
other than a standardized test score
 
04:58:20.448 --> 04:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
for example in my school district the
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
scores are traditionally low but we had
 
04:58:25.550 --> 04:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of children graduate and do
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
wonderful in the Arts and Music and that
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
sort of thing which are not measured on
 
04:58:32.810 --> 04:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
any standardized tests but certainly
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
they are achieving at a high level with
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
that on those things
 
04:58:39.288 --> 04:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
did you think about another measurement
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
for achievement other than the state
 
04:58:42.240 --> 04:58:43.250 align:start position:0%
for achievement other than the state
tests

04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
tests
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for your questions uh two
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
of them the first one you mentioned uh
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
media uh median income and and
 
04:58:53.050 --> 04:58:53.060 align:start position:0%
um income level and educational level
 
04:58:55.368 --> 04:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
especially educational level of the
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
mother but the income level and the
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
educational level of the parents
 
04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
sure income higher educational level
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
better the kids going to do in the test
 
04:59:05.570 --> 04:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
sure and there is a correlation between
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
income levels which has been well
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
documented in achievement but I kind of
 
04:59:11.330 --> 04:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
touched on that when I responded to
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's question in
 
04:59:17.810 --> 04:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
that uh the schools were this to move
 
04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
forward in some fashion would be
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
competing if if you want to use the word
 
04:59:23.218 --> 04:59:24.470 align:start position:0%
competing if if you want to use the word
competing

04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
competing
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
um and try to think of a different word
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
they would be simply uh
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
working looking at their own scores and
 
04:59:36.170 --> 04:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to improve those
 
04:59:38.930 --> 04:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
scores however that may be locally and
 
04:59:41.050 --> 04:59:41.060 align:start position:0%
were they to do that
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
then they would be identified and
 
04:59:47.930 --> 04:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
rewarded in terms of your uh point about
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
other measures of of
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
achievement or whatever you'd like to
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
call with students you know are doing uh
 
05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
very valid point and uh
 
05:00:07.970 --> 05:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
I do think uh that in the mix of
 
05:00:12.288 --> 05:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
measures to be identified and is is uh
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
to reward you need some metrics uh I
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
think many of us think and without some
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
uh numbers without some metrics uh
 
05:00:25.208 --> 05:00:25.218 align:start position:0%
that's a problem so this uh as I said
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
initially had some specific prescriptive
 
05:00:30.530 --> 05:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
metrics that Doe asked that we not
 
05:00:33.770 --> 05:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
include in language so to answer your
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
question uh without numbers or metrics
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to how do you know if
 
05:00:44.690 --> 05:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
you know it's and I know there are ways
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
to qualitatively identify Improvement
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
but I think there is a place a little
 
05:00:54.050 --> 05:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
place a small place for some numbers and
 
05:00:55.850 --> 05:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
metrics in addition to that and that's
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
what this would try to do
 
05:01:02.690 --> 05:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
yes okay so when you're using the
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
metrics that within the school itself
 
05:01:06.970 --> 05:01:06.980 align:start position:0%
are you measuring
 
05:01:10.010 --> 05:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
are you measuring the Improvement of the
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
same group of children from year to year
 
05:01:14.570 --> 05:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
or are you taking this year's third
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
graders and comparing them to last
 
05:01:19.368 --> 05:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
year's third graders which are two
 
05:01:20.930 --> 05:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
different groups of children with two
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
different groups of family education
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
levels and income levels sure thank you
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
for that question and there are all Yes
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
or else to answer your question uh we
 
05:01:31.550 --> 05:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
are aware there's all kinds of variables
 
05:01:34.448 --> 05:01:34.458 align:start position:0%
and the intent that we conveyed to doe
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.810 --> 05:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
and I won't go into the assessments that
 
05:01:46.128 --> 05:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
we recommended that they use because
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
they ask that they have discretion to
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
identify the assessments so the intent
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
was for example uh fourth grade you know
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
there are certain annual exams tests as
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
you know for fourth graders eighth
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
graders 11th graders that that type of
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
if the average score for the fourth
 
05:02:11.330 --> 05:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
graders in 2023 uh
 
05:02:13.970 --> 05:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
improved by whatever metric doe
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
identifies over 2019 then they would get
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
in a an award or reward according to the
 
05:02:23.090 --> 05:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the formula that would be
 
05:02:23.100 --> 05:02:26.868 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the formula that would be
established

05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
and and just to again to make sure I
 
05:02:31.730 --> 05:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
answer your question completely
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
um so you're asking about like a
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
longitudinal situation where the same
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
students would be tested and the answer
 
05:02:40.250 --> 05:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
would be that's not the vision of this
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
the 2023 third grade or or fourth
 
05:02:47.570 --> 05:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
graders 20 the 2023 fourth grade scores
 
05:02:50.208 --> 05:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
would be contested compared to the 2019
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
fourth grade scores by a different group
 
05:02:56.330 --> 05:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
but the pedagogy uh would presumably you
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
know uh different pedagogies would be
 
05:03:00.170 --> 05:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
tried to see if they could improve the
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
scores so different different groups
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen
 
05:03:08.570 --> 05:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:03:11.330 --> 05:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how I feel about the
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
implication that
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
teachers might work harder or students
 
05:03:18.660 --> 05:03:20.990 align:start position:0%
teachers might work harder or students
might

05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience a higher quality education
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
because a cash prize is being offered
 
05:03:26.400 --> 05:03:28.190 align:start position:0%
because a cash prize is being offered
but

05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I would Echo
 
05:03:34.970 --> 05:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Porter's concerns over
 
05:03:38.830 --> 05:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
this year's class of third graders being
 
05:03:41.930 --> 05:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
identical to next year's class of third
 
05:03:44.330 --> 05:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
graders and therefore being able to be
 
05:03:47.090 --> 05:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
compared that seems like apples and
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
oranges to me to a to a certain degree
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if uh you have asked
 
05:03:55.250 --> 05:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department to be here
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
today to discuss the criteria and
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not socioeconomic class rural
 
05:04:05.770 --> 05:04:05.780 align:start position:0%
versus Urban uh what what sort of
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
elements for evaluation are going to be
 
05:04:10.730 --> 05:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
included I'm wondering if uh if there's
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
somebody here that can do that
 
05:04:15.288 --> 05:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your your points and
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
your question I'm not sure if uh you can
 
05:04:20.090 --> 05:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
see behind me Mr chairs is there someone
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have one yes sir there is one person
 
05:04:30.050 --> 05:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
here from doe uh and that back to your
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
your question uh it's philosophically
 
05:04:33.480 --> 05:04:34.190 align:start position:0%
your question uh it's philosophically
um

05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
course I come from this is an athletic
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
component to my journey and the
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
rewards Athletics by definition you keep
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
score and there are rewards for success
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
and I believe and many others believe
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
that that model is one that certainly
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
Bears consideration and application in
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
the academic realm as well
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and an incentive uh if this incentive
 
05:05:07.730 --> 05:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
um prodded or encouraged some schools to
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps try some different uh mode of
 
05:05:15.050 --> 05:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
instruction or you know perhaps in
 
05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
seeking such an award uh you know
 
05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
parents may get more involved for
 
05:05:21.890 --> 05:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
example uh it depends upon how this is
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
presented but uh press I I and folks
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
like myself have have no problem in fact
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
we like the idea of incentivizing
 
05:05:30.840 --> 05:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
we like the idea of incentivizing
success

05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
success
 
05:05:34.970 --> 05:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
and having some measurable metrics and
 
05:05:34.980 --> 05:05:36.530 align:start position:0%
and having some measurable metrics and
goals

05:05:36.530 --> 05:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
goals
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to you know a nebulous
 
05:05:42.410 --> 05:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
situation where you just uh you know
 
05:05:44.930 --> 05:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
trust that that uh everyone's going to
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
do a good job which I I think happens in
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
most cases but to have this additional
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
Dynamic out there uh many of us think as
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
great Merit we would like to
 
05:05:57.600 --> 05:05:58.250 align:start position:0%
great Merit we would like to
um

05:05:58.250 --> 05:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
let doe try something Innovative I guess
 
05:06:03.530 --> 05:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
to use the word some representative
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
Woodcock used earlier
 
05:06:08.690 --> 05:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I have uh one question and
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh you know let uh represent cordelli he
 
05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
has of course apparently too uh several
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
years ago when we rewrote some of the
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
accountability statute uh we
 
05:06:24.288 --> 05:06:24.298 align:start position:0%
wrote it so it doesn't uh strictly uh
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
point to achievement
 
05:06:30.170 --> 05:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
it also appoints to points to growth
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
and when we introduced legislation to
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
try to get accountability for the third
 
05:06:39.650 --> 05:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
grade reading proficiency levels that we
 
05:06:42.530 --> 05:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
have that under differentiated Aid
 
05:06:46.190 --> 05:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
we did compare we were requesting that
 
05:06:48.170 --> 05:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
the third graders that were in the
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
be compared to that same group of kids
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's next year in the fourth grade so
 
05:06:57.410 --> 05:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's Apples to Apples
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I think that that so I would ask that
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
that be a consideration that we're
 
05:07:06.288 --> 05:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
comparing this child same child to the
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
in both years there another issue which
 
05:07:11.330 --> 05:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
is associated with that that we've got
 
05:07:13.368 --> 05:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
to be very careful on
 
05:07:16.490 --> 05:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
there is a high transcency level in some
 
05:07:18.770 --> 05:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
of these districts and schools such as
 
05:07:18.780 --> 05:07:20.330 align:start position:0%
of these districts and schools such as
Manchester

05:07:20.330 --> 05:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
05:07:22.368 --> 05:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
and you definitely are not going to get
 
05:07:25.250 --> 05:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
an Apple to Apple there and then on
 
05:07:27.050 --> 05:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
Converse there's some very small
 
05:07:29.208 --> 05:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
districts that only have
 
05:07:31.850 --> 05:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
less than 40 kids in the district or 60
 
05:07:31.860 --> 05:07:32.810 align:start position:0%
less than 40 kids in the district or 60
kids

05:07:32.810 --> 05:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
I I hesitate in trying to
 
05:07:40.970 --> 05:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
get give an award out to something so
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
small where our statistical data starts
 
05:07:45.470 --> 05:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
pointing to a specific student
 
05:07:47.810 --> 05:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
which we know that we don't do with any
 
05:07:49.730 --> 05:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
aggregate testing for less than 10 or
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
less students
 
05:07:53.810 --> 05:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
so um and that our achievement tests are
 
05:07:55.010 --> 05:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
done at these grade levels where
 
05:07:56.448 --> 05:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's only seven or eight
 
05:07:57.890 --> 05:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
kids in a class in the in the grade
 
05:07:57.900 --> 05:07:58.850 align:start position:0%
kids in a class in the in the grade
level

05:07:58.850 --> 05:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
so somehow there should be some
 
05:08:01.970 --> 05:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
accountability built into that how we're
 
05:08:03.770 --> 05:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
going to do it for those small districts
 
05:08:05.690 --> 05:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
and then and taking account the
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
transcency and and care and comparing I
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
would think Apple to Apple
 
05:08:13.490 --> 05:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and and that I
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
understand the thinking and the point
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
that you're you're making
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:08:22.250 --> 05:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you follow up on what you just said
 
05:08:24.170 --> 05:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
take staying with as I said to
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Porter if you stickle the
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
longitudinal approach even that uh
 
05:08:31.550 --> 05:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to have students who come
 
05:08:33.288 --> 05:08:33.298 align:start position:0%
into a fourth grade who weren't there
 
05:08:35.330 --> 05:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
before students who leave so that would
 
05:08:38.330 --> 05:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
not be perfect either in terms of uh you
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
know your your sample group or whatever
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there's different ways to to do this
 
05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
you could have the longitudinal approach
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
or the approach where you just have uh
 
05:08:47.700 --> 05:08:49.128 align:start position:0%
or the approach where you just have uh
the

05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
specific grade not the specific body
 
05:08:54.288 --> 05:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
which of course is is going to change as
 
05:08:54.298 --> 05:08:55.788 align:start position:0%
which of course is is going to change as
well

05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:08:57.770 --> 05:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
um but as I've said a couple times
 
05:08:57.780 --> 05:08:58.730 align:start position:0%
um but as I've said a couple times
already

05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:08:58.740 --> 05:08:59.448 align:start position:0%
already
um

05:08:59.448 --> 05:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
we don't though the sponsors did not
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to be overly prescriptive with doe
 
05:09:09.170 --> 05:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
we wanted to give doe as we want to with
 
05:09:12.410 --> 05:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
localities uh local control if you want
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
to put it in those terms and make a fund
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
available for doe to have to reward as
 
05:09:25.850 --> 05:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
you said earlier districts that for
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason somehow do things
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
differently or better and their their
 
05:09:34.090 --> 05:09:34.100 align:start position:0%
scores improved in a measurable fashion
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
so great questions uh again uh
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
I we the sponsors have chosen to uh
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
listen to doe and to trust doe and so we
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
backed off from imposing our original uh
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
as I said fairly prescriptive approach
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
and just let them have some latitude to
 
05:09:59.530 --> 05:09:59.540 align:start position:0%
try to come up with something
 
05:10:03.170 --> 05:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
Innovative and different that could be a
 
05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
model that could get some more money to
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
schools and uh
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps provide some some inspiration
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:10:17.690 --> 05:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
and a model for other schools
 
05:10:17.700 --> 05:10:19.850 align:start position:0%
and a model for other schools
representative

05:10:19.850 --> 05:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
the question are you aware With No Child
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
Left Behind the federal government was
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
evaluating different grades but third
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
grade for example for the next year is
 
05:10:34.368 --> 05:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
third grade and and that was their
 
05:10:36.850 --> 05:10:36.860 align:start position:0%
method of achievement
 
05:10:39.530 --> 05:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
not swallowing the same kid they were
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
following grades
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative right uh of
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
course No Child Left Behind his normal
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
effect but their approach
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
was non-longitudinal right
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
yes and I'm aware of that
 
05:10:53.878 --> 05:10:55.070 align:start position:0%
yes and I'm aware of that
representative

05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:56.448 --> 05:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
on the other side there representative
 
05:10:56.458 --> 05:10:58.010 align:start position:0%
on the other side there representative
yeah

05:10:58.010 --> 05:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
question uh Sports were a big part of my
 
05:11:06.890 --> 05:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
journey too both as a participant and as
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
a coach in public schools and
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we're not professional sports so we
 
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't get rewarded with money we got
 
05:11:17.948 --> 05:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
rewarded with medals or
 
05:11:21.128 --> 05:11:21.138 align:start position:0%
achievement awards and clearly
 
05:11:23.930 --> 05:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
achievement awards can be given out at
 
05:11:27.650 --> 05:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
any time uh representative Mullen and I
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
both had schools that were designated by
 
05:11:33.050 --> 05:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
the federal government as outstanding
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
schools and they received an award
 
05:11:40.850 --> 05:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
the doe was there as well but uh
 
05:11:40.860 --> 05:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
the doe was there as well but uh
certainly

05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
um I I would ask why
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
why put money on the table when
 
05:11:54.910 --> 05:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
the usual and customary
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
procedure in education for awards is
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
non-monetary and a school that a
 
05:12:05.330 --> 05:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
gets an award for being a high
 
05:12:07.730 --> 05:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
functioning school you know I think they
 
05:12:09.770 --> 05:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
got a flag and you know they were able
 
05:12:12.050 --> 05:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
to have a ceremony involve parents and
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
parents came in to see how great it was
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
I would think that that would be
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
and it certainly has a set of criteria
 
05:12:21.230 --> 05:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
that they evaluate schools on and the
 
05:12:24.288 --> 05:12:24.298 align:start position:0%
doe does part of that evaluation
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering why all of a sudden we
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
need this big chunk of money that we're
 
05:12:31.550 --> 05:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
going to give doe to hand out to schools
 
05:12:34.250 --> 05:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question representative
 
05:12:35.930 --> 05:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
um well in terms of a big chunk of money
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
it a million bucks used to be a lot of
 
05:12:41.810 --> 05:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
money uh you know I today it's uh it's
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
not so much
 
05:12:43.440 --> 05:12:44.570 align:start position:0%
not so much
um

05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
I well it it
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
really I remember when that was a lot of
 
05:12:53.330 --> 05:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
money and uh but it is kind of a it's a
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
nice round figure to uh to put out there
 
05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
as part of this uh you know possible
 
05:13:01.250 --> 05:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
proposal but I I gotta say when you talk
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
about rewarding achievement
 
05:13:06.410 --> 05:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
um scholarships inherently reward
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
individual achievement
 
05:13:11.690 --> 05:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
um that's uh that happens all the time
 
05:13:15.650 --> 05:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
if if a student individually uh
 
05:13:18.050 --> 05:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
demonstrates academic proficiency or
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
success then then they get scholarships
 
05:13:25.128 --> 05:13:25.138 align:start position:0%
so this is uh not a scholarship per se
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a different approach uh to
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
award some some rewards some collective
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
success and uh I
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
not sure again what the criteria
 
05:13:40.730 --> 05:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
ultimately would be we want doe to have
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
the freedom to to develop a formula
 
05:13:46.970 --> 05:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
criteria that they think would work uh
 
05:13:49.010 --> 05:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
we did put a limit of fifty thousand
 
05:13:52.550 --> 05:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollars uh to a uh
 
05:13:55.850 --> 05:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
to a reward reward or an award to a
 
05:13:55.860 --> 05:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
to a reward reward or an award to a
school

05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
um but again uh this is a way to reward
 
05:14:04.010 --> 05:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
the team uh the school the community as
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
opposed to just uh having individuals
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
my second question really uh is there is
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
there a committee At Doe or you keep
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
talking about this group At Doe that is
 
05:14:26.208 --> 05:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
helping you develop this is that going
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be the same committee that's going to
 
05:14:30.770 --> 05:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
decide uh which School receives how much
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
money or or whether is there going to be
 
05:14:36.770 --> 05:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
a committee set up or are you just
 
05:14:39.650 --> 05:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
simply going to take the yearly reports
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
of schools by ranking and just chop off
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
the top five and give them the amount of
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
money well I'm not sure if you
 
05:14:48.288 --> 05:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
understand the the
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
the program is described the schools
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
would be competing just against
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
themselves not so the notion of the top
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
five that's not part of the equation at
 
05:15:01.970 --> 05:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
all your question about the the uh the
 
05:15:04.730 --> 05:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
team At Doe uh again that as I've said
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
several times we want to allow
 
05:15:09.310 --> 05:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
discretion to the uh to the department
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
to uh create uh using their own
 
05:15:16.730 --> 05:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
expertise and human resources and
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
background and to develop the ultimate
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh formula criteria for the uh Awards
 
05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
and uh honestly I think when if this
 
05:15:29.410 --> 05:15:29.420 align:start position:0%
moves forward
 
05:15:32.330 --> 05:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
a school that uh
 
05:15:35.570 --> 05:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
in seeking to uh
 
05:15:38.448 --> 05:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
distinguish itself and and improve some
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
scores and if they were publicly
 
05:15:44.448 --> 05:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
rewarded uh then there may be some best
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
practices that would flow from that that
 
05:15:49.090 --> 05:15:49.100 align:start position:0%
a neighboring school would would say
 
05:15:52.368 --> 05:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
they would see school a uh did something
 
05:15:54.410 --> 05:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
different and they improved their scores
 
05:15:55.730 --> 05:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
and they get a fifty thousand dollar
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
what did they do
 
05:16:01.850 --> 05:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
um and so I see value to to that that's
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:16:07.150 --> 05:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
it's part of the historical American
 
05:16:11.330 --> 05:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
competitive uh ethos that some of us
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
think uh the education World which I
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
most of us might myself certainly been a
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
part of that ethos I think might serve
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
the education World in a good way if if
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:28.970 --> 05:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:16:33.050 --> 05:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
question you seem to be using school
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
district and schools interchangeably and
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know which you mean because
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have 21 schools
 
05:16:43.250 --> 05:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
so is it a Manchester schools will be
 
05:16:45.530 --> 05:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
competing against each other for awards
 
05:16:47.750 --> 05:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
or is it Manchester as a whole school
 
05:16:51.550 --> 05:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
district competing with 12 000 students
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
competing against a town that has a
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
hundred students
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
sure thank you it's a great question and
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
the uh the division he attended this was
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
for a school uh not a the district comes
 
05:17:09.770 --> 05:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
into play in some cases you have to work
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
through the district
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
to make an award and it I Manchester
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
certainly is different from certain
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
other schools but the uh intent was for
 
05:17:24.410 --> 05:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
a school
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
um to Simply improve that school's
 
05:17:31.550 --> 05:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
right right so uh
 
05:17:36.890 --> 05:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
there are some schools there are
 
05:17:38.570 --> 05:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
districts under themselves but like I
 
05:17:40.850 --> 05:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
said you make a great point that I think
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
doe would
 
05:17:44.690 --> 05:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
as as if and when this moves forward
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
they would need to you know clarify
 
05:17:50.330 --> 05:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
District versus school you know who or
 
05:17:52.250 --> 05:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
how they would be competing for an award
 
05:17:53.708 --> 05:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
they'll be
 
05:17:57.170 --> 05:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
needing to be defined sure and this is
 
05:17:57.180 --> 05:18:00.770 align:start position:0%
needing to be defined sure and this is
just

05:18:00.770 --> 05:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:06.770 --> 05:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
the intent was
 
05:18:10.610 --> 05:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
originally for uh school districts
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
and if you look at line three it says
 
05:18:15.650 --> 05:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
rewarding school districts so any public
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
school district uh is opposed so so
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
parochial schools would not be eligible
 
05:18:24.530 --> 05:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
would have to be Public Schools
 
05:18:27.230 --> 05:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh thank you Mr
 
05:18:28.730 --> 05:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:18:31.368 --> 05:18:31.378 align:start position:0%
I'll make this quick uh I would not have
 
05:18:34.250 --> 05:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
gone down the road of of using Athletics
 
05:18:36.590 --> 05:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
for this argument but I my specific
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
question is are you aware that the NFL
 
05:18:41.690 --> 05:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
the NBA and the national basketballs
 
05:18:44.690 --> 05:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
baseball association all set up their
 
05:18:46.970 --> 05:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
annual drafts and give priority to those
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
teams that have done the worst in the
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
previous season
 
05:18:55.730 --> 05:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh yes a very aware of how
 
05:18:58.930 --> 05:18:58.940 align:start position:0%
that works and and um
 
05:19:01.368 --> 05:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
again as you know the the intent there
 
05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
is to try to improve the the bad teams
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
that have done poorly yeah I that that's
 
05:19:07.378 --> 05:19:08.628 align:start position:0%
that have done poorly yeah I that that's
a

05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's but of course with public schools
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
or Far Cry from the NFL the NBA but but
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
I yeah I'm tracking you sure
 
05:19:19.250 --> 05:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:21.288 --> 05:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
okay we have room for one more question
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
and then we've got to move on here
 
05:19:25.010 --> 05:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
represent Porter thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Moffett are you aware
 
05:19:29.570 --> 05:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
that we had two public schools in New
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who received the national
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
School of Excellence award this year
 
05:19:37.730 --> 05:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
no I couldn't tell you off top my head
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
about that no so don't you think that
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
that would be an incentive to folks but
 
05:19:45.410 --> 05:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
yet it got no publicity
 
05:19:48.650 --> 05:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
I I think that any school that wins
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
Awards should I used to be in PR and uh
 
05:19:55.368 --> 05:19:55.378 align:start position:0%
I've spent so much time uh the universal
 
05:19:57.410 --> 05:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
system and Community College system in
 
05:19:59.330 --> 05:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
addition to teaching to doing everything
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
I could to get attention from the media
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
for uh academic success and and I that's
 
05:20:10.610 --> 05:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
been my world so yes I I think that
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful I think that that type
 
05:20:15.530 --> 05:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
of recognition uh is a place for it and
 
05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
we need to shine a light on it and this
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
I think would uh would complement that
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
it would be another arrow in the quiver
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing achievement the Department
 
05:20:29.208 --> 05:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
of Education might have made a big deal
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
out of it do you think
 
05:20:33.410 --> 05:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
I would support uh shining a light in
 
05:20:35.810 --> 05:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
success any way that we can thank you
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:20:39.530 --> 05:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
a Moffett we do have one other person
 
05:20:45.948 --> 05:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
here and that's from the Department we
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
have Nate Green from the Department of

um come here as as technical advice or
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions we may specifically
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
have of the department in relation to
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
05:21:06.310 --> 05:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
is there are there any questions for
 
05:21:09.530 --> 05:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
represent moan from Manchester

wonderful wonderful representative Vlad
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
I will indulge you the error because I
 
05:21:26.208 --> 05:21:26.218 align:start position:0%
was born and grew up in Manchester and
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
it is near and dear to me still so I
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
will indulge you that slip of the tongue
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that kind remark you're
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
quite welcome uh thank you for taking my
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
question and uh Nate actually uh sat
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
with representative Tanner and I at the
 
05:21:48.530 --> 05:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
educational Excellence award dinner so
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
welcome to House Education it's uh good
 
05:21:54.410 --> 05:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
to see you again thank you
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so I have questions about uh the
 
05:22:02.448 --> 05:22:02.458 align:start position:0%
paragraph that is Roman 2 in the bill
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
that talks about the criteria to qualify
 
05:22:08.930 --> 05:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
for the awards
 
05:22:11.330 --> 05:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I would like to know what
 
05:22:15.050 --> 05:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
the process for application will be what
 
05:22:18.288 --> 05:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
the committee who determines
 
05:22:20.810 --> 05:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
who who's going to receive the awards
 
05:22:24.530 --> 05:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
will look like and what the demographics
 
05:22:28.250 --> 05:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
are that will be used to evaluate or
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
rank or uh for instance
 
05:22:34.550 --> 05:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status size of the school
 
05:22:37.490 --> 05:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
whether or not the school is urban or
 
05:22:37.500 --> 05:22:39.288 align:start position:0%
whether or not the school is urban or
rural

05:22:39.288 --> 05:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
rural
 
05:22:42.850 --> 05:22:42.860 align:start position:0%
um maybe uh you know sort of previous
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
Trends in standardized testing and what
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
measures would be used
 
05:22:48.240 --> 05:22:49.610 align:start position:0%
measures would be used
sure

05:22:49.610 --> 05:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so for the record my name is uh Dr
 
05:22:52.730 --> 05:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
Nate green I'm with the New Hampshire
 
05:22:54.770 --> 05:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh one of the
 
05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
many hats that I wear at the department
 
05:22:58.190 --> 05:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
is uh director of the accountability
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
system for the Department there are a
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
couple of different avenues that we
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
could go down so I don't know exactly
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
how this would be implemented I do see
 
05:23:11.090 --> 05:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh further down that there is a 541a
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
ability so it's possible the department
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
could adopt uh some rules around this
 
05:23:17.090 --> 05:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
and and really spell out the procedure
 
05:23:20.208 --> 05:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
when we talk about things like growth
 
05:23:22.730 --> 05:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
um there's two different ways that the
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
department measures growth right now one
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
is just a standard growth across all
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
students and that looks at two years of
 
05:23:32.090 --> 05:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
growth on our state standardized
 
05:23:34.250 --> 05:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
assessment system and when we're talking
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
about comparing grades to grades or
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
students to students it gets down to
 
05:23:40.730 --> 05:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
actually an even finer level of detail
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
there so we take students and we put
 
05:23:45.050 --> 05:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
them together into a group of all the
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
students in their grade who got the same
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
score as they did and then we look at
 
05:23:51.530 --> 05:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
how that particular population of
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
students did across two years so it's
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
both longitudinal but it only Compares
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
students with other students who scored
 
05:24:00.890 --> 05:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the same score range that they did
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then looks at an average growth of
 
05:24:06.410 --> 05:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
that particular group of students and
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
then we take those averages together
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
when we create School profiles and
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
District profiles and put them together
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
as averages so that's your standard
 
05:24:15.770 --> 05:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
growth indicator that's one way that we
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
could look at this and we do rank
 
05:24:19.128 --> 05:24:19.138 align:start position:0%
schools and we look to see which schools
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
are showing the highest levels of growth
 
05:24:23.090 --> 05:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
and which schools are showing the lowest
 
05:24:24.650 --> 05:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
levels of growth
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to point out the growth
 
05:24:28.610 --> 05:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
is not the same thing as proficiency you
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
can have a school that has a very high
 
05:24:32.090 --> 05:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
level of growth but a very low level of
 
05:24:34.610 --> 05:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
proficiency we measure proficiency on a
 
05:24:37.610 --> 05:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
scale of one to four four being most
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
proficient one being least proficient
 
05:24:41.690 --> 05:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
you could have a school that has a large
 
05:24:43.970 --> 05:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
number of students move from a level one
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
to a level two so their students are
 
05:24:47.930 --> 05:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
still not proficient but they showed a
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
large amount of growth similarly you
 
05:24:51.530 --> 05:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
could have a school that has a high
 
05:24:53.390 --> 05:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
proficiency and still has a high level
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
of growth if a number of students move
 
05:24:57.890 --> 05:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
from a level three to a level four so
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's one way another way that we
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
measure growth is called our growth
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
Equity indicator and that uses the same
 
05:25:07.490 --> 05:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
formulas except it applies a weighting
 
05:25:09.650 --> 05:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
system to particular subgroups of
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
students so it applies a heavier weight
 
05:25:15.128 --> 05:25:15.138 align:start position:0%
to free and reduced lunch students
 
05:25:17.868 --> 05:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
students that have IEPs and are
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
receiving Services Under special
 
05:25:21.170 --> 05:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
education and students that are English
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
language Learners and so that particular
 
05:25:27.830 --> 05:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
looks at the growth of the school but it
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
waits heavily in favor of subgroups of
 
05:25:31.850 --> 05:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
students that we know traditionally are
 
05:25:31.860 --> 05:25:33.050 align:start position:0%
students that we know traditionally are
underserved

05:25:33.050 --> 05:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
so both of those could be a way that we
 
05:25:37.850 --> 05:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
could rank schools and looking at this
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular Bell
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yesterday
 
05:25:46.368 --> 05:25:46.378 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong Dr Green
 
05:25:46.378 --> 05:25:49.788 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong Dr Green
uh

05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
schools that are already
 
05:25:54.770 --> 05:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
highly proficient
 
05:25:58.970 --> 05:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
May in fact have lower
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
score lower on a growth model if there
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
is not
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of room to grow if you will
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the ceiling for that grade level is
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible but because we're
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking at two years worth of data the
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores go up each year
 
05:26:21.288 --> 05:26:21.298 align:start position:0%
in terms of the score ranges and so even
 
05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
if you had a whole school that scored
 
05:26:25.368 --> 05:26:25.378 align:start position:0%
level four in the first year that we
 
05:26:27.650 --> 05:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
were looking at it we know not every
 
05:26:29.090 --> 05:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
single one of those students will score
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
a little for the second year and then
 
05:26:32.448 --> 05:26:32.458 align:start position:0%
the third year when we're looking at the
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
data so there's still a lot of variation
 
05:26:35.810 --> 05:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
in there
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
one more thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:26:42.530 --> 05:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett indicated that he
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
had been working with people at the doe
 
05:26:47.330 --> 05:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
are you in fact one of those people
 
05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes so myself uh one of my colleagues
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
Scott Courier who's the administrator of
 
05:26:54.530 --> 05:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
the Office of Public Schools uh and
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis I believe have all met and
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill okay thank you very
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
we have uh within statute rrc 193 e
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
which has the indicators for acquiring
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
05:27:14.330 --> 05:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
most of those indicators apply to high
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
schools or the end end of the term of
 
05:27:19.730 --> 05:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
K-12 were going on for
 
05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
future work and post-secondary joining
 
05:27:25.850 --> 05:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
the military uh percentage of uh kids
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that are not suspended or expelled
 
05:27:29.810 --> 05:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
attendance rates all that's in the
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
indicators to identify whether a school
 
05:27:35.090 --> 05:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
is meeting some of their goals that
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
we've set out in statute might that not
 
05:27:42.050 --> 05:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
be a way to identify but I'm also
 
05:27:44.330 --> 05:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
concerned that do we already have a
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
process in the schools for excellence
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
such as the small school just north of
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
us the bath Village School we received
 
05:27:53.650 --> 05:27:53.660 align:start position:0%
one of those Awards several years ago
 
05:27:57.650 --> 05:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
and the criteria was that we look at the
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
instruction we looked the building we
 
05:28:01.550 --> 05:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
look at security we look at all the
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
components of education and and talk
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
with parents and and we have a school
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
that's really shining bright
 
05:28:11.930 --> 05:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
um would that be another way of
 
05:28:14.930 --> 05:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
identifying without having to award the
 
05:28:14.940 --> 05:28:16.850 align:start position:0%
identifying without having to award the
money

05:28:16.850 --> 05:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:28:19.010 --> 05:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that we do to
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
identify Schools of Excellence in our
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
state yes
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
the program is a federal program it's
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
the Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
program one of the drawbacks however is
 
05:28:31.368 --> 05:28:31.378 align:start position:0%
that we're Limited in the number of
 
05:28:33.230 --> 05:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
schools that we can nominate and award
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
each year we're limited to a maximum of
 
05:28:37.390 --> 05:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
three as a small state in New Hampshire
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
so we might have 10 or 15 in fact we're
 
05:28:42.110 --> 05:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
going through the process right now
 
05:28:43.970 --> 05:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
looking at the Blue Ribbon Schools for
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
this coming school year and I think we
 
05:28:49.128 --> 05:28:49.138 align:start position:0%
had about 16 or 17 schools that all met
 
05:28:51.470 --> 05:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
the criteria but at the end of the day
 
05:28:53.810 --> 05:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
we can only choose three of those to
 
05:28:55.850 --> 05:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
give those Awards out to
 
05:28:58.490 --> 05:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up might it be another way
 
05:29:00.530 --> 05:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
of doing it though that we have our own
 
05:29:03.650 --> 05:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
State School of Excellence program and
 
05:29:05.810 --> 05:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
rather than identifying just those that
 
05:29:07.610 --> 05:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
are based on that National Standard to
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
develop our own standard and recognize
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
that way
 
05:29:11.040 --> 05:29:13.010 align:start position:0%
that way
absolutely

05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
Braxton Woodside wood
 
05:29:22.970 --> 05:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
the governor is back okay um
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
Dr Greene good afternoon and thank you
 
05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
for helping me through this
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
um in looking at the document in the the
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
range of the student performance on the
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide education Improvement and
 
05:29:38.570 --> 05:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
Assessment program you were talking
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
about growth and assessment in this
 
05:29:42.170 --> 05:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
particular case when you're when you're
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
ranking schools with the student
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
performance be be the same as the
 
05:29:49.010 --> 05:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
student proficiency
 
05:29:49.020 --> 05:29:50.690 align:start position:0%
student proficiency
yes

05:29:50.690 --> 05:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be an academic proficiency
 
05:29:54.890 --> 05:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
score we wouldn't be looking at the
 
05:29:54.900 --> 05:29:56.390 align:start position:0%
score we wouldn't be looking at the
growth

05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
growth
 
05:29:59.090 --> 05:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
so the growth is the amount of growth
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
students have shown on the proficiency
 
05:30:04.128 --> 05:30:04.138 align:start position:0%
scale yes okay
 
05:30:06.650 --> 05:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
and it's two separate indicators so
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
elementary schools have four primary
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
indicators there's the growth and the
 
05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
equity that I spoke about we also report
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
just the level of proficiency so that
 
05:30:17.930 --> 05:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
the percentage of students that are
 
05:30:20.448 --> 05:30:20.458 align:start position:0%
proficient within the school and then we
 
05:30:21.650 --> 05:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
have a fourth indicator for elementary
 
05:30:23.690 --> 05:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
schools that looks specifically at our
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:26.878 --> 05:30:28.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:30:28.930 --> 05:30:28.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Improvement in student performance
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
that should be rating for this
 
05:30:39.350 --> 05:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
particular Merit uh cash reward would be
 
05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
the academic performance
 
05:30:44.330 --> 05:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
strictly yes
 
05:30:46.910 --> 05:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
05:30:46.920 --> 05:30:49.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
questions

05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.410 --> 05:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you thank you
 
05:30:52.850 --> 05:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair thank you very much
 
05:30:55.490 --> 05:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
Dr Greene for joining us this afternoon
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
um but the um is it am I correct that
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
the bill excuse me in um
 
05:31:06.890 --> 05:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
and uh uh Roman 2 does let would allow
 
05:31:08.930 --> 05:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
the department to consider other
 
05:31:11.390 --> 05:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
replicable data
 
05:31:15.170 --> 05:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
it does yeah and follow-up such as what
 
05:31:17.690 --> 05:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen suggested uh
 
05:31:20.208 --> 05:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
possibly socioeconomic um conditions
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay and we do that with a
 
05:31:24.590 --> 05:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
variety of other programs where we might
 
05:31:26.090 --> 05:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
start with the assessment and the growth
 
05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
data but we consider three or four other
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
five variables in addition to that when
 
05:31:33.170 --> 05:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
making final selections so and one final
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up on on that so would a um could
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
potentially a school district that that
 
05:31:43.970 --> 05:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
is under um social you know has has low
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
low socioeconomic conditions seeing
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
seeing modest growth or modest
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement in in performance that could
 
05:31:57.708 --> 05:31:57.718 align:start position:0%
be considered say a bigger move than uh
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
than a larger increase in performance in
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
a district that had let's say it's just
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
more affluent sure okay yeah and in fact
 
05:32:08.510 --> 05:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
as we were talking about the Blue Ribbon
 
05:32:10.490 --> 05:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
Schools so we nominate three schools a
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
year but one of the requirements is also
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
that one of the three schools must have
 
05:32:16.250 --> 05:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
greater than 40 percent free and reduced
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
lunch student populations so another
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
program that takes into additional
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
factors beyond academics and a final
 
05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that one Rick and you
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
probably know what I'm going to ask
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
have a hot clue sure you do so so with
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
with with with frpl data
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
sort of cratered right right now
 
05:32:42.050 --> 05:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
how is how is that
 
05:32:44.690 --> 05:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
um you know what what are you using as a
 
05:32:48.050 --> 05:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
as a metric for socioeconomic
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
conditions because and this is a this is
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
a thing that is a question yeah that's
 
05:32:53.810 --> 05:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's why I thought you'd yeah
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a question though I have
 
05:33:02.770 --> 05:33:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
I think we're looking at a number of of
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
different uh variables uh because that's
 
05:33:10.010 --> 05:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
what you raise actually touches a large
 
05:33:11.150 --> 05:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
number of programs at the department
 
05:33:13.368 --> 05:33:13.378 align:start position:0%
that all rely on federal funding that
 
05:33:15.948 --> 05:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
rely on those numbers
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
um and so the the impact of not having
 
05:33:20.930 --> 05:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
either good numbers or or you know what
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've gone through in the last two years
 
05:33:24.590 --> 05:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
with free reduced lunch numbers just not
 
05:33:25.850 --> 05:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
coming in because we've had other
 
05:33:25.860 --> 05:33:27.288 align:start position:0%
coming in because we've had other
avenues

05:33:27.288 --> 05:33:27.298 align:start position:0%
avenues
 
05:33:30.288 --> 05:33:30.298 align:start position:0%
um we're we're working on that thank you
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
very much I I probably that does touch a
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
lot of programs like even Career
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
Technical education that whole Carl
 
05:33:40.550 --> 05:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
Perkins is based on f p pre and reduced
 
05:33:43.250 --> 05:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh program it is yeah
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
so are there other questions for
 
05:33:49.730 --> 05:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
Dr Green right now at this time
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chairman
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
do we have any other cards for this
 
05:33:59.208 --> 05:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.490 --> 05:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so at this time we'll close
 
05:34:03.948 --> 05:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
this hearing and prepare to go into the
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:12.050 --> 05:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
you know a kid in basketball though down
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
to Linda there what does the coach do
 
05:34:16.730 --> 05:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
coach benches
 
05:34:19.850 --> 05:34:19.860 align:start position:0%
but but we also have different divisions
 
05:34:21.890 --> 05:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
for our kids to compete in you know a
 
05:34:26.930 --> 05:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.850 --> 05:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't speak the school at
 
05:34:30.368 --> 05:34:30.378 align:start position:0%
all anyways
 
05:34:32.390 --> 05:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
read it
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
right right yeah you know you just do it
 
05:34:36.360 --> 05:34:41.810 align:start position:0%
right right yeah you know you just do it
because

05:34:41.810 --> 05:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
my school was up where I was on the old
 
05:34:46.610 --> 05:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
Iowa Test basic skills California
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
achievement tests we always scored in
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
the 90th percentile it was
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
we've really never showed much growth so
 
05:35:01.250 --> 05:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
because we're always there so we can
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
improve yeah and that's where
 
05:35:05.570 --> 05:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
representation was right
 
05:35:05.580 --> 05:35:08.090 align:start position:0%
representation was right
yeah

05:35:08.090 --> 05:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.100 --> 05:35:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:35:14.090 --> 05:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:14.100 --> 05:35:17.150 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:22.128 --> 05:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
this is kind of contrary to where we
 
05:35:25.368 --> 05:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
were going
 
05:35:28.970 --> 05:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
and getting weightless from Strictly
 
05:35:28.980 --> 05:35:32.750 align:start position:0%
and getting weightless from Strictly
rope

05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:35.448 --> 05:35:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:35.458 --> 05:35:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a little bit of growth
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:49.368 --> 05:35:49.378 align:start position:0%
oh that's right
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
or the robin sticker on the work when
 
05:36:08.208 --> 05:36:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.970 --> 05:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.128 --> 05:36:16.138 align:start position:0%
excuse US Representative cordelli we
 
05:36:19.010 --> 05:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
discussion up here
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
does everybody have one that's going
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
no no we just we just do what we do
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's okay we're ready
 
05:36:40.490 --> 05:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
to go ahead with HB 1137 this bill is
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the duty of school boards to
 
05:36:45.050 --> 05:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
provide education and representative
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
cordelli is ready to start so welcome
 
05:36:47.458 --> 05:36:48.350 align:start position:0%
cordelli is ready to start so welcome
again

05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:36:50.930 --> 05:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and uh
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee colleagues for the record I am
 
05:36:55.730 --> 05:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
state representative Glenn cordelli
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
representing tufton Borough
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
moultonborough mine sandwich in the
 
05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lakes Region
 
05:37:01.440 --> 05:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lakes Region
um

05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
HB 1137 is about local school boards uh
 
05:37:10.490 --> 05:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've ever seen local
 
05:37:15.530 --> 05:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
school boards in the press as much as we
 
05:37:19.970 --> 05:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
have seen seen them in the past year
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and they're uh
 
05:37:26.050 --> 05:37:26.060 align:start position:0%
some common themes
 
05:37:30.530 --> 05:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
arising from these reports many people
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
many parents are upset
 
05:37:35.628 --> 05:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
for various reasons everything from
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory to issues related
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
to public comments to mask mandates and
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
curriculum access
 
05:37:48.050 --> 05:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
for many there is the feeling among
 
05:37:50.810 --> 05:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
parents that some school boards have no
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
interest in hearing from them or
 
05:37:55.610 --> 05:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
communicating with them
 
05:37:57.530 --> 05:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
even we have seen
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
a national attack on parents as a
 
05:38:06.050 --> 05:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorists
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
HP 1137 deals with some of these issues
 
05:38:12.890 --> 05:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
as well as the lack of specified duties
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
or responsibilities of local school
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
boards and our statutes
 
05:38:21.010 --> 05:38:21.020 align:start position:0%
we try and address these issues
 
05:38:24.190 --> 05:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
via the themes of Parental engagement
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
and transparency
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
go through the bill briefly if I could
 
05:38:35.990 --> 05:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and highlight a few things if I might
 
05:38:36.000 --> 05:38:37.128 align:start position:0%
and highlight a few things if I might
um

05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:40.490 --> 05:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
on the first page everything in Bolden
 
05:38:43.448 --> 05:38:43.458 align:start position:0%
is is new text
 
05:38:46.850 --> 05:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
we talk about responsibilities of the
 
05:38:46.860 --> 05:38:47.650 align:start position:0%
we talk about responsibilities of the
board

05:38:47.650 --> 05:38:47.660 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:38:47.660 --> 05:38:49.330 align:start position:0%
board
including

05:38:49.330 --> 05:38:49.340 align:start position:0%
including
 
05:38:51.610 --> 05:38:51.620 align:start position:0%
review of the
 
05:38:54.788 --> 05:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum textbook approvals
 
05:38:57.770 --> 05:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
measurable standards
 
05:39:01.368 --> 05:39:01.378 align:start position:0%
and we outline other things that school
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
boards should do
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
such as and I imagine in most places
 
05:39:10.010 --> 05:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
they do develop Implement and vote on
 
05:39:12.410 --> 05:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
District policies and that should be
 
05:39:14.448 --> 05:39:14.458 align:start position:0%
done in public session
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
all public auction all meetings of the
 
05:39:19.490 --> 05:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
board and subcommittees
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
should be held pursuant to 91a laws and
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
I know uh just locally in the past
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we had a finance committee of our
 
05:39:34.610 --> 05:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
school board who met with no minutes no
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
public notice of their meetings uh
 
05:39:39.368 --> 05:39:39.378 align:start position:0%
anything and I think that
 
05:39:42.410 --> 05:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
that is not proper
 
05:39:44.650 --> 05:39:44.660 align:start position:0%
or legal
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
over on page two
 
05:39:50.930 --> 05:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
we specify that the boards are
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
responsible for conducting annual
 
05:39:55.150 --> 05:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
performance reviews of the district
 
05:39:59.470 --> 05:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent I think in too many cases
 
05:40:02.930 --> 05:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
school boards don't realize that the
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent reports to them and
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes the superintendent doesn't
 
05:40:09.170 --> 05:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
05:40:09.180 --> 05:40:10.610 align:start position:0%
realize that
um

05:40:10.610 --> 05:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:13.810 --> 05:40:13.820 align:start position:0%
the board doesn't report to them
 
05:40:18.230 --> 05:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
they should provide an opportunity for
 
05:40:20.448 --> 05:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
comment from board members
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
I think in many cases board members are
 
05:40:23.878 --> 05:40:24.948 align:start position:0%
I think in many cases board members are
muzzled

05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
muzzled
 
05:40:27.530 --> 05:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
by local policies and that's not right
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
every elected official should have the
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
ability and the responsibility for
 
05:40:34.190 --> 05:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
speaking their mind and presenting their
 
05:40:34.200 --> 05:40:35.810 align:start position:0%
speaking their mind and presenting their
opinions

05:40:35.810 --> 05:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
05:40:38.810 --> 05:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh we move into a section then related
 
05:40:42.050 --> 05:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
to parental engagement and it should be
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
the duty of the board to encourage
 
05:40:47.448 --> 05:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
public attendance at board meetings and
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
to provide for public input
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
at multiple times during the meeting
 
05:40:57.650 --> 05:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
and also to allow that input for agenda
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
as well as non-agenda items sometimes
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
that is not the case at some board
 
05:41:03.718 --> 05:41:06.430 align:start position:0%
that is not the case at some board
meetings

05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
the boards should also develop and
 
05:41:12.910 --> 05:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
Implement a policy
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
then into a section related to
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
transparency and I think this is
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
um a key area also and we call for
 
05:41:29.090 --> 05:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
posting of manifests on the district
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
website as well as curriculum and
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
competencies should be made available to
 
05:41:37.250 --> 05:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
um posting of professional development
 
05:41:43.250 --> 05:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and workshop topics so the public can
 
05:41:46.750 --> 05:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
see what the teachers are being
 
05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
instructed on or uh
 
05:41:54.890 --> 05:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
development days are being devoted to
 
05:41:57.530 --> 05:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
there should also be on the district
 
05:41:57.540 --> 05:41:59.150 align:start position:0%
there should also be on the district
website

05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
student achievement information
 
05:42:04.730 --> 05:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
enrollment information
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
per pupil costs
 
05:42:09.890 --> 05:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that would be either on the district
 
05:42:12.890 --> 05:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
website itself or a link to the
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website I think
 
05:42:18.410 --> 05:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
would be viable as well
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I also think when we're talking
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
about transparency and parental
 
05:42:22.920 --> 05:42:24.050 align:start position:0%
about transparency and parental
engagement

05:42:24.050 --> 05:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
05:42:26.810 --> 05:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
that there should be an annual end of
 
05:42:30.850 --> 05:42:30.860 align:start position:0%
year parent survey as to
 
05:42:35.208 --> 05:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
their beliefs and opinions on what is
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
going on in the school district I think
 
05:42:40.788 --> 05:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
that that's key we we call for that in
 
05:42:42.410 --> 05:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
other programs we we just talked about
 
05:42:45.050 --> 05:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
the tax growth tax credit scholarship
 
05:42:46.970 --> 05:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
program a few minutes ago and that's
 
05:42:46.980 --> 05:42:48.730 align:start position:0%
program a few minutes ago and that's
required

05:42:48.730 --> 05:42:48.740 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:42:51.010 --> 05:42:51.020 align:start position:0%
in that program
 
05:42:54.970 --> 05:42:54.980 align:start position:0%
and was in the original EFA
 
05:42:59.030 --> 05:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
language as well
 
05:42:59.040 --> 05:43:00.288 align:start position:0%
language as well
um

05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the packet that I handed out there
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
are a number of exhibits uh the first
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
couple are related to parents being
 
05:43:09.120 --> 05:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
couple are related to parents being
arrested

05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
05:43:13.610 --> 05:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
at school board meetings
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
there have also been a number of
 
05:43:19.128 --> 05:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
instances here in New Hampshire where uh
 
05:43:21.850 --> 05:43:21.860 align:start position:0%
summonses have been given out to parents
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
unmasked parents for criminal trespass
 
05:43:28.010 --> 05:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
I know when my local Regional School
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
District in Wolfeboro
 
05:43:33.830 --> 05:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
parents were given a criminal trespass
 
05:43:37.070 --> 05:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
summons for not wearing masks at the
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
public board meeting
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
um they filed a complaint with the local
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
police commission and they worked out a
 
05:43:47.690 --> 05:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
deal you know we'll drop the police
 
05:43:49.430 --> 05:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
complaint and you drop the criminal
 
05:43:49.440 --> 05:43:50.448 align:start position:0%
complaint and you drop the criminal
summons

05:43:50.448 --> 05:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
summons
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
however a day later
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
they got an email from the town attorney
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
telling them that if they did not drop
 
05:44:02.330 --> 05:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
their 91a requests for curriculum
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
information they would be reported to
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
the State Attorney General's office
 
05:44:11.470 --> 05:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.410 --> 05:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
next are exhibits related to the need to
 
05:44:18.650 --> 05:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
communicate and listen to parents first
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
as a policy brief from the Nea
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
then there are three documents related
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the spring
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
603 Bright Futures survey done by the
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh this is in
 
05:44:36.170 --> 05:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
the family survey section
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and I draw your uh attention to the
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
state survey and the question do you
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
feel School the school values your
 
05:44:46.320 --> 05:44:47.410 align:start position:0%
feel School the school values your
opinions

05:44:47.410 --> 05:44:47.420 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
response was 44 thought that that was a
 
05:44:54.590 --> 05:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is further evidence that school
 
05:45:00.410 --> 05:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
boards cannot ignore parents
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
another reason New Hampshire school
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
boards have to pay attention to and
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
respect parents and for the parental
 
05:45:11.390 --> 05:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are on page two of
 
05:45:13.850 --> 05:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
the legislation school boards have to be
 
05:45:13.860 --> 05:45:14.930 align:start position:0%
the legislation school boards have to be
accountable

05:45:14.930 --> 05:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
they have to reset represent the people
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
in the district the parents in the
 
05:45:21.850 --> 05:45:21.860 align:start position:0%
district and there has to be trust
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
between the board
 
05:45:27.470 --> 05:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and parents trust is a vital
 
05:45:31.010 --> 05:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
component to improving board community
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
relations and improving what goes on in
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
the school district and I believe that
 
05:45:42.770 --> 05:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
this in legislation is intended to help
 
05:45:46.070 --> 05:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
us move down that path to restoring and
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
improving trust between the community
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
and the schools
 
05:45:53.090 --> 05:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%

05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
05:45:56.040 --> 05:45:57.708 align:start position:0%

05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:46:08.448 --> 05:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
you're uh dropping of approved
 
05:46:11.570 --> 05:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian schools
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
yes um that is consistent with uh other
 
05:46:22.490 --> 05:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
statute that we have passed uh in the
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:32.570 --> 05:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Jefferson Ellison uh thank you Mr
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
05:46:37.680 --> 05:46:38.330 align:start position:0%
question sure
um

05:46:38.330 --> 05:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:41.990 --> 05:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
on page two uh let's see
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
H1 which refers to encouraging public
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
attendance at board meetings which I
 
05:46:49.610 --> 05:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
think is a great idea uh then it gets
 
05:46:54.048 --> 05:46:54.058 align:start position:0%
into providing multiple public input at
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
multiple times during the board meetings
 
05:46:59.570 --> 05:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how that's going to get
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
set up if you have if the public has the
 
05:47:04.990 --> 05:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
right to multiple have multiple inputs
 
05:47:09.470 --> 05:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
on not only agenda but non-agenda items
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
and you have as we know to our award
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
meetings how how do you see that playing
 
05:47:16.260 --> 05:47:17.690 align:start position:0%
meetings how how do you see that playing
out

05:47:17.690 --> 05:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:47:17.700 --> 05:47:18.530 align:start position:0%
out
um

05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:20.570 --> 05:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
a couple of things there
 
05:47:22.730 --> 05:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I think multiple times is important
 
05:47:22.740 --> 05:47:23.930 align:start position:0%
um I think multiple times is important
because

05:47:23.930 --> 05:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:47:26.570 --> 05:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
um very often boards schedule pump
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
public input at the end of the meeting
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
and if it's two meeting two hour meeting
 
05:47:34.128 --> 05:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
it could be 10 o'clock uh parents have
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
left to attend to matters at home I
 
05:47:40.850 --> 05:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
think that that is a problematic for for
 
05:47:43.548 --> 05:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
many parents in terms of the agenda
 
05:47:45.650 --> 05:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
items or non-agend items
 
05:47:48.650 --> 05:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
um there have been times when boards
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
have told parents that um their public
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
comment is out of line because they are
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
discussing uh
 
05:48:00.048 --> 05:48:00.058 align:start position:0%
some a topic that is not on the agenda
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
for that evening that's what I was
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
05:48:04.610 --> 05:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
um in that regard parents should be able
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
to comment on items that are not on the
 
05:48:09.890 --> 05:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
agenda for that meeting
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
well look Mr chair yes uh I'm talking
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
more I think or asking more about the
 
05:48:15.718 --> 05:48:16.788 align:start position:0%
more I think or asking more about the
process

05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:48:18.890 --> 05:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
which if I'm in a school board meeting
 
05:48:20.570 --> 05:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
and a school board member said something
 
05:48:23.930 --> 05:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I can I jump up and say I object or
 
05:48:25.850 --> 05:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
I need to ask you more questions I mean
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a wide open
 
05:48:31.010 --> 05:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
process that would allow someone many
 
05:48:34.368 --> 05:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
many people to become involved I mean
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
you've got to have some regulation right
 
05:48:38.930 --> 05:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
now I you know I I view multiple comment
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
periods for input not okay
 
05:48:45.410 --> 05:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
um although uh I am aware of uh even
 
05:48:47.090 --> 05:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
school districts that I knew back in
 
05:48:47.100 --> 05:48:48.350 align:start position:0%
school districts that I knew back in
Connecticut

05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
um where they would allow for public
 
05:48:50.040 --> 05:48:51.170 align:start position:0%
um where they would allow for public
comment

05:48:51.170 --> 05:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
um after various agenda items so that if
 
05:48:55.788 --> 05:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
um you know something came up during the
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
discussion uh parents should be able to
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
cordelli again
 
05:49:09.610 --> 05:49:09.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering
 
05:49:11.868 --> 05:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
I've spent a lot of years on the
 
05:49:12.890 --> 05:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
05:49:15.470 --> 05:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee and one thing that we learned
 
05:49:18.048 --> 05:49:18.058 align:start position:0%
that I learned over that period of time
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
was that sometimes communities have a
 
05:49:21.000 --> 05:49:22.310 align:start position:0%
was that sometimes communities have a
problem

05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
they don't like how things are running
 
05:49:27.530 --> 05:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
so they come to us to make a law to fix
 
05:49:27.540 --> 05:49:29.628 align:start position:0%
so they come to us to make a law to fix
it

05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
when many other communities in the state
 
05:49:35.810 --> 05:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
don't have that problem and making the
 
05:49:38.810 --> 05:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
law is going to make it difficult for
 
05:49:40.490 --> 05:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
them to do their jobs so in other words
 
05:49:43.490 --> 05:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
we didn't like one size fits all laws
 
05:49:46.010 --> 05:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
for the whole state
 
05:49:47.570 --> 05:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and we would often vote them down and
 
05:49:49.490 --> 05:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this and remembering my
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
time on the school board and all of
 
05:49:53.208 --> 05:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
these things that you have listed were
 
05:49:55.730 --> 05:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
things that we did
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
and we did them because we had been
 
05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
trained and how to Be an Effective
 
05:50:02.690 --> 05:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
05:50:06.048 --> 05:50:06.058 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if maybe a little
 
05:50:06.058 --> 05:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if maybe a little
carrot

05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
carrot
 
05:50:11.090 --> 05:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
or a training thing to get some
 
05:50:16.730 --> 05:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
districts Bill no okay if if it would be
 
05:50:19.850 --> 05:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
a way to encourage school boards to do
 
05:50:22.250 --> 05:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
these things without putting it in
 
05:50:25.970 --> 05:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
statute where it is a requirement for
 
05:50:28.208 --> 05:50:28.218 align:start position:0%
all School boards to do them
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think this legislation would try to
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
make all School boards as effective as
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.490 --> 05:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
but in some communities it might not be
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
the best for them to have all these
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
things for example we heard today
 
05:50:50.810 --> 05:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
several times about how deliberative
 
05:50:53.330 --> 05:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
sessions and budget hearings were poorly
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
were poorly attended in their
 
05:50:57.708 --> 05:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
communities and then we have this
 
05:50:59.770 --> 05:50:59.780 align:start position:0%
section in here that encouraging
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
parental involvement those things seem
 
05:51:05.690 --> 05:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
to be conflicting if you can't encourage
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
people to get involved if people were
 
05:51:10.850 --> 05:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
encouraged to get involved they would
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
come to this deliberative session or if
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
people were inclined to be involved they
 
05:51:16.610 --> 05:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
would be coming
 
05:51:19.730 --> 05:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
You're Expecting
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
more than can be given for some
 
05:51:25.730 --> 05:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
communities to do
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
make a hardship for some communities to
 
05:51:28.440 --> 05:51:29.208 align:start position:0%
make a hardship for some communities to
do

05:51:29.208 --> 05:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
I don't view it that way I think that
 
05:51:33.360 --> 05:51:35.090 align:start position:0%
I don't view it that way I think that
um

05:51:35.090 --> 05:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
parents are very concerned about their
 
05:51:39.850 --> 05:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
children's education
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
now more so than maybe in recent years
 
05:51:46.628 --> 05:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
past but that
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
in promoting parental engagement
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
encouraging attendance policies related
 
05:51:55.330 --> 05:51:55.340 align:start position:0%
to that policies that give
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
parents the opportunity to participate
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
in their children's education I think
 
05:52:08.090 --> 05:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:09.410 --> 05:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
05:52:13.490 --> 05:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:52:14.810 --> 05:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking
 
05:52:17.208 --> 05:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
president for taking uh my three
 
05:52:17.218 --> 05:52:18.830 align:start position:0%
president for taking uh my three
questions

05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the first one I'm looking at uh the
 
05:52:25.730 --> 05:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
topic on Glen on page two it's the eight
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with Community interest other
 
05:52:31.850 --> 05:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.910 --> 05:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
s I'm wondering if the community
 
05:52:39.770 --> 05:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
interests topics uh would be could be in
 
05:52:43.628 --> 05:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
your in your regulation or your law here
 
05:52:46.490 --> 05:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
limited to those that impact public
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.170 --> 05:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
I mean this the the way it's written
 
05:52:54.180 --> 05:52:54.890 align:start position:0%
I mean this the the way it's written
um

05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:58.150 --> 05:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
it opens a whole plethora of of
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to voice support or
 
05:53:03.948 --> 05:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
discontent on community interests I
 
05:53:05.570 --> 05:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
would be glad to work with you on an
 
05:53:08.448 --> 05:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
amendment to include uh that that
 
05:53:10.368 --> 05:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
Community interest would be related to
 
05:53:12.650 --> 05:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
schools and not potholes or something
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I was thinking more like we
 
05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
have the bathroom issue here in North
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
Conway yes
 
05:53:19.730 --> 05:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
um the second one for me there's only
 
05:53:22.250 --> 05:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
three second one um
 
05:53:25.368 --> 05:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
on I'm looking at line 12 developing
 
05:53:27.650 --> 05:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you developing and implementing a
 
05:53:30.110 --> 05:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
policy to allow classroom visitation
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
my question there is on by whom
 
05:53:36.650 --> 05:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
parents so is that going to be specified
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
as parents
 
05:53:38.878 --> 05:53:41.690 align:start position:0%
as parents
um

05:53:41.690 --> 05:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:48.530 --> 05:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh and then the third part if I may I'm
 
05:53:54.530 --> 05:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
looking at line 20 uh
 
05:53:56.150 --> 05:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
which actually
 
05:53:56.160 --> 05:53:57.770 align:start position:0%
which actually
uh

05:53:57.770 --> 05:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:00.590 --> 05:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
concerns me particularly the talk about
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
and review academic curriculum
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
I have two questions the the general
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
topic of review I have no problem with
 
05:54:09.230 --> 05:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
reviewing this reviewing that put on a
 
05:54:10.490 --> 05:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
website I don't know what you're going
 
05:54:11.448 --> 05:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:54:14.208 --> 05:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
after you review it but the opportunity
 
05:54:16.490 --> 05:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
to review it is up there I mean we have
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
we have the the uh quick off there for
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
the most part but when it's an academic
 
05:54:23.930 --> 05:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
curriculum I'm concerned about how
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
detailed you're looking
 
05:54:29.090 --> 05:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh we can't for example if we're doing a
 
05:54:30.850 --> 05:54:30.860 align:start position:0%
civics class
 
05:54:35.570 --> 05:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh uh contemporary civics and today for
 
05:54:37.010 --> 05:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
the second semester
 
05:54:40.690 --> 05:54:40.700 align:start position:0%
we clearly can't have put on the website
 
05:54:43.548 --> 05:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
all the topics we may be talking about
 
05:54:45.770 --> 05:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
or the material they may be using on a
 
05:54:47.390 --> 05:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
current service class I mean our English
 
05:54:50.810 --> 05:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
101 basic grammar absolutely but on ones
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
that have that deal with a lot of
 
05:54:53.628 --> 05:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
particularly I think youngsters get
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
older as those courses have more uh
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
Socratic method uh we can't with this I
 
05:55:00.288 --> 05:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
don't want what detail are you looking
 
05:55:01.310 --> 05:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
for there what are you actually looking
 
05:55:01.320 --> 05:55:02.930 align:start position:0%
for there what are you actually looking
for

05:55:02.930 --> 05:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
um basically the general curriculum not
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
looking for lesson plans or anything
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
like that if that's you know where
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're I don't know where you're going
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's what yeah right curriculum
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
what does that mean just general
 
05:55:15.240 --> 05:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
what does that mean just general
curriculum

05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the curriculum for the course English
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
101 what is the curriculum what topic
 
05:55:23.570 --> 05:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
should be covered
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um what are the criteria what's the
 
05:55:28.730 --> 05:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
05:55:28.740 --> 05:55:30.070 align:start position:0%
subject matter
um

05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:34.128 --> 05:55:34.138 align:start position:0%
that you I I think the board
 
05:55:36.948 --> 05:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
my experience anyway from back when I
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
was on a school board the board approved
 
05:55:40.670 --> 05:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
the curriculum right and an outline of
 
05:55:42.288 --> 05:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
what was to be covered as part of that
 
05:55:42.298 --> 05:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
what was to be covered as part of that
curriculum

05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:55:43.680 --> 05:55:44.708 align:start position:0%
curriculum
um

05:55:44.708 --> 05:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I remember uh specifically
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
um objecting to parts of that curriculum
 
05:55:54.490 --> 05:55:54.500 align:start position:0%
okay and having to change
 
05:55:57.890 --> 05:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
showing uh just I
 
05:55:57.900 --> 05:55:58.970 align:start position:0%
showing uh just I
um

05:55:58.970 --> 05:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:02.448 --> 05:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
early 20th century America curriculum
 
05:56:05.208 --> 05:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
they wanted to show as an example of
 
05:56:07.850 --> 05:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
that period of time The Godfather movie
 
05:56:10.610 --> 05:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay which I objected to and and they
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
did pull that out of the curriculum so
 
05:56:14.448 --> 05:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
if we may see your so you're actually
 
05:56:16.128 --> 05:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
getting into the lesson plans and what
 
05:56:19.610 --> 05:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh they listed um the uh
 
05:56:21.890 --> 05:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
any uh audio visual that would be part
 
05:56:23.570 --> 05:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum to be shown to that
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
class for 20th century America for
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
instance so you're in in this case then
 
05:56:30.890 --> 05:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
you really are getting in the detailed
 
05:56:32.330 --> 05:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
Russell plan the curriculum because you
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to know that
 
05:56:37.970 --> 05:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
um so any based on that once it's in
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
annually anything that changes during
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
the school year uh an instructor
 
05:56:44.570 --> 05:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use if they have new
 
05:56:47.390 --> 05:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
more contemporary or more authentic or
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
undocumented data or films or books or
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
whatever because it wasn't in the
 
05:56:52.200 --> 05:56:53.390 align:start position:0%
whatever because it wasn't in the
curriculum

05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:56:56.448 --> 05:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that they're all always
 
05:56:56.458 --> 05:56:57.530 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that they're all always
things

05:56:57.530 --> 05:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:57:01.250 --> 05:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
um speakers that might come up or uh
 
05:57:03.650 --> 05:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
something in current events that might
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
come up
 
05:57:09.170 --> 05:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
um that certainly would be uh discussed
 
05:57:12.230 --> 05:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
in class but not necessarily part of the
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
curriculum the curriculum curriculum
 
05:57:17.330 --> 05:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't change month to month or
 
05:57:20.590 --> 05:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily year to year
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
the student handbook the student
 
05:57:26.448 --> 05:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
handbook of course selection I'm
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
starting out with up a little I don't
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
know what happens down at one two three
 
05:57:31.128 --> 05:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
four but at the upper level in the high
 
05:57:34.010 --> 05:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
school the student handbook identifies
 
05:57:36.830 --> 05:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the the curricula from what you're
 
05:57:38.810 --> 05:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
asking it has the mission or the
 
05:57:40.610 --> 05:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
objectives of the class and those things
 
05:57:41.810 --> 05:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
so you said that's all that's what you
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
all you want is you want the crafty what
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're actually teaching uh or how
 
05:57:48.170 --> 05:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
detailed that's you said just general
 
05:57:50.510 --> 05:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be mission
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's a question right
 
05:57:56.208 --> 05:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond just a mission
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
um for instance in our handbook uh so to
 
05:57:59.400 --> 05:58:00.410 align:start position:0%
um for instance in our handbook uh so to
speak

05:58:00.410 --> 05:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:58:03.650 --> 05:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
um there's an outline of what each uh
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
each committee is to do
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
um which you could see uh possibly as a
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
mission but um for the curriculum I
 
05:58:15.650 --> 05:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
think it goes a step below that so the
 
05:58:16.730 --> 05:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
objectives the mission and the
 
05:58:19.788 --> 05:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
objectives objectives and some detail as
 
05:58:22.730 --> 05:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
to what's to be covered uh an objective
 
05:58:25.330 --> 05:58:25.340 align:start position:0%
might be to
 
05:58:27.470 --> 05:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
learn about
 
05:58:31.610 --> 05:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the Apollo space program I I would
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
think that the curriculum would have a
 
05:58:35.990 --> 05:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail than that
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
oh I would suggest that would be the
 
05:58:40.490 --> 05:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
lesson plan supporting the curriculum
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'm done
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Mullen
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I promise to be brief
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you thank
 
05:58:54.110 --> 05:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
you you're you're quite welcome thank
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:58:55.080 --> 05:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
representative

05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:58:59.770 --> 05:58:59.780 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with Logistics
 
05:59:03.530 --> 05:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
around the uh multiple times during the
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
school board meeting and the phrase
 
05:59:10.250 --> 05:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
about allowing classroom visitation
 
05:59:12.410 --> 05:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I can see where different school
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
districts would interpret that
 
05:59:16.250 --> 05:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
differently you know one might have
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
public comment at the beginning maybe
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
then again before they go into
 
05:59:25.150 --> 05:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
non-public session or whatever and then
 
05:59:27.530 --> 05:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items at the end somebody
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
else may do it differently
 
05:59:33.010 --> 05:59:33.020 align:start position:0%
when you um when you talk about
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
encouraging public attendance and
 
05:59:38.090 --> 05:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
providing for are you do you envision
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
sort of tailoring this to their own
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
methodology yes okay and would that also
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
apply to classroom visitations yes okay
 
05:59:55.070 --> 05:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
because I uh I I
 
05:59:58.730 --> 05:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a scheduled
 
06:00:01.070 --> 06:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
sort of classroom visitation day which
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
lots of schools have and visitation at
 
06:00:07.850 --> 06:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
will and uh I think I I I would expect
 
06:00:10.010 --> 06:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
that a visitation would have to be
 
06:00:10.020 --> 06:00:11.570 align:start position:0%
that a visitation would have to be
pre-arranged

06:00:11.570 --> 06:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
pre-arranged
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
um but I know even
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I just received uh correspondence
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
from a special ed parent who would like
 
06:00:17.638 --> 06:00:18.410 align:start position:0%
from a special ed parent who would like
to

06:00:18.410 --> 06:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
is being prevented from observing in the
 
06:00:23.448 --> 06:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
classroom because they want to see how
 
06:00:25.970 --> 06:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
the IEP is working in the classroom for
 
06:00:28.610 --> 06:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
their child and so I was concerned about
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
not being able to view the child in the
 
06:00:34.010 --> 06:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
classroom to see how things are going
 
06:00:38.510 --> 06:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
then see that as just being some sort of
 
06:00:43.548 --> 06:00:43.558 align:start position:0%
thing that would be worked out between
 
06:00:47.570 --> 06:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay one final question we're in line 11
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
06:00:52.128 --> 06:00:52.138 align:start position:0%
um where you talk about involvement with
 
06:00:54.470 --> 06:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
classroom and at home learning
 
06:00:57.288 --> 06:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
are we talking about homeschooling or no
 
06:00:59.690 --> 06:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
we're talking about like homework right
 
06:00:59.700 --> 06:01:00.770 align:start position:0%
we're talking about like homework right
I

06:01:00.770 --> 06:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:01:04.368 --> 06:01:04.378 align:start position:0%
homework and maybe even summer reading
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
and things like that's why I
 
06:01:08.030 --> 06:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I tried to use something other than
 
06:01:10.010 --> 06:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and that's why I said Home
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
Learning perfect thank you very much
 
06:01:14.208 --> 06:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:15.890 --> 06:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
 
06:01:18.048 --> 06:01:18.058 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
06:01:24.048 --> 06:01:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.810 --> 06:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'd like to invite Eric power
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:38.570 --> 06:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and my name is Eric
 
06:01:43.970 --> 06:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
power I I'm from Brookline
 
06:01:46.190 --> 06:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
served as a co-op School Board member
 
06:01:48.048 --> 06:01:48.058 align:start position:0%
but I was also a parent
 
06:01:50.750 --> 06:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
I am a parent still and I just wanted to
 
06:01:52.010 --> 06:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about some of the
 
06:01:54.288 --> 06:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
bills very positive aspects I think this
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
is a great bill I I think you guys I
 
06:01:59.570 --> 06:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
think that the committee should pass it
 
06:02:03.410 --> 06:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
recommend Auto pass I saw as I started a
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
school board I know I felt you know by
 
06:02:07.850 --> 06:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
the way they passed policies I felt like
 
06:02:09.770 --> 06:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
I was muzzled that you know you had to
 
06:02:11.810 --> 06:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
speak as a board as one voice and a
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
dissenting voice was not really allowed
 
06:02:16.250 --> 06:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that that was
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I was a little less uh knowledgeable
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
about everything back then but uh you
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
know I grew to be able to start speaking
 
06:02:25.610 --> 06:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
my mind a little bit more you know you
 
06:02:28.010 --> 06:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
don't you should be able to have that
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and have be able to express
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
that you don't speak for the board but
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
you do speak for yourself as a member of
 
06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
the board
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I know I've talked to other parents
 
06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and myself where we've asked for answers
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
made comments and public comment at the
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
school board and there's never been any
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up or the follow-up's been vague
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that that this bill helps
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
address that problem
 
06:02:53.090 --> 06:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
there's also a problem where the school
 
06:02:54.770 --> 06:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
board wasn't really aware of what was in
 
06:02:56.330 --> 06:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
the curriculum as representative
 
06:02:59.330 --> 06:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
cordelli talked about and uh there was a
 
06:03:00.770 --> 06:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
book English book called The Glass
 
06:03:02.930 --> 06:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
Castle which some people thought was
 
06:03:02.940 --> 06:03:04.190 align:start position:0%
Castle which some people thought was
pornographic

06:03:04.190 --> 06:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
pornographic
 
06:03:06.590 --> 06:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
and they objected to it and the board
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
members except for one didn't even know
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
it was part of the curriculum so I would
 
06:03:12.770 --> 06:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
imagine under English curriculum you
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
would list the books that might be read
 
06:03:16.850 --> 06:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
as part of the English clerk home in
 
06:03:19.490 --> 06:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
grades 9 10 11 12.
 
06:03:23.628 --> 06:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
I had made an objection myself to a book
 
06:03:26.810 --> 06:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
called Ender's Game and that was made in
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
approximately January my son was still
 
06:03:31.010 --> 06:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
forced to read it they met finally with
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
a with a committee and decided in June
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
that it was okay
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
they didn't even know about it but it
 
06:03:38.930 --> 06:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
was just uh it was a problem because of
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
awareness in the school board and I
 
06:03:44.090 --> 06:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
think that this bill helps address that
 
06:03:47.150 --> 06:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
I've personally made multiple inquiries
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
on policies
 
06:03:50.330 --> 06:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
to our school board
 
06:03:52.010 --> 06:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I've gotten no reply or
 
06:03:53.930 --> 06:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment it just goes in and
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
nothing it doesn't ever come up as a
 
06:03:58.250 --> 06:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
policy to be changed even to be looked
 
06:03:58.260 --> 06:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
policy to be changed even to be looked
at

06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:04:01.368 --> 06:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
they just don't respond
 
06:04:03.770 --> 06:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
I've also had times where they stopped
 
06:04:05.570 --> 06:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
us talking about items that weren't on
 
06:04:07.010 --> 06:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
the agenda
 
06:04:08.868 --> 06:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
if it's not on the agenda you can't talk
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:04:12.110 --> 06:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
well when can we talk about it
 
06:04:14.208 --> 06:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
when it's on the agenda how do you get
 
06:04:16.190 --> 06:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
it on the agenda
 
06:04:18.288 --> 06:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
the chair decides
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
so you have that kind of problem so you
 
06:04:22.250 --> 06:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
know that shouldn't happen that also has
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
happened with the school district budget
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee that we have as well but this
 
06:04:28.850 --> 06:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
is not the scope of that but that's also
 
06:04:30.110 --> 06:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
a problem there
 
06:04:30.120 --> 06:04:31.490 align:start position:0%
a problem there
and

06:04:31.490 --> 06:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:34.190 --> 06:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I think a good practice is not to
 
06:04:34.200 --> 06:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
um I think a good practice is not to
have

06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:04:35.520 --> 06:04:36.410 align:start position:0%
have
uh

06:04:36.410 --> 06:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
there should be designated time for for
 
06:04:40.670 --> 06:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
public input I would say minimally one
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
but it should be several times but it
 
06:04:44.448 --> 06:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a free-for-all they should
 
06:04:47.150 --> 06:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
make it over any important issues so
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you know at least two to three
 
06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
times where parents can be able to speak
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they could also be able to speak on
 
06:04:56.090 --> 06:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items they should they should
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
be able to maybe they won't have a
 
06:04:59.570 --> 06:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
detailed discussion on it but at least
 
06:05:02.090 --> 06:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
it will be there and the board can vote
 
06:05:04.190 --> 06:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not to put it on the next uh
 
06:05:06.650 --> 06:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
next meetings agenda if necessary
 
06:05:10.850 --> 06:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
but overall I think that this bill helps
 
06:05:13.610 --> 06:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
ensure all boards do the minimal things
 
06:05:17.150 --> 06:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they should be to encourage uh
 
06:05:18.830 --> 06:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
positive interaction with the community
 
06:05:21.288 --> 06:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
especially in the last year or two I
 
06:05:23.530 --> 06:05:23.540 align:start position:0%
think it's a very important bill for
 
06:05:26.030 --> 06:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
helping guide school boards and what
 
06:05:29.150 --> 06:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
they need to do as boards and also what
 
06:05:31.070 --> 06:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
the rights are of parents and taxpayers
 
06:05:33.650 --> 06:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
I think that would go a long way to
 
06:05:35.448 --> 06:05:35.458 align:start position:0%
making things work better in New
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I would encourage ought to
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
pass out of the committee thank you
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:05:44.810 --> 06:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr honor
 
06:05:44.820 --> 06:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr honor
at

06:05:45.910 --> 06:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:05:48.770 --> 06:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
p-a-u-n-e-r yeah correct
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
I I do have a question for you when you
 
06:05:53.150 --> 06:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
got on the board
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
were you providing any information as
 
06:05:56.448 --> 06:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
far as
 
06:05:58.850 --> 06:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
what are the responsibilities and duties
 
06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
of a board member and giving some of the
 
06:06:03.890 --> 06:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
parameters that are exist right here
 
06:06:06.350 --> 06:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
within this legislation
 
06:06:08.270 --> 06:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
we were given some of them but certainly
 
06:06:11.330 --> 06:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
not all of them there is some you know I
 
06:06:13.970 --> 06:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
read through the rsas the RSA is
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
obviously not complete and there was
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
some training that was given by the
 
06:06:21.170 --> 06:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
School Board Association at the time and
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
I attended that but I felt still it
 
06:06:26.090 --> 06:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't proper and it you know it did
 
06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
train me to say well you can have a
 
06:06:29.750 --> 06:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
dissenting voice and you can quietly
 
06:06:32.930 --> 06:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
vote no but beyond that don't speak
 
06:06:35.628 --> 06:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
about it and that's not really right it
 
06:06:37.730 --> 06:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
should be a board members was I was
 
06:06:40.208 --> 06:06:40.218 align:start position:0%
elected by the the people I should be
 
06:06:42.170 --> 06:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
representing people and I should be able
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
to have my opinion and not be muzzled
 
06:06:47.330 --> 06:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
and this bill helps Rectify that by
 
06:06:50.030 --> 06:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
putting it into law thank you
 
06:06:50.040 --> 06:06:51.530 align:start position:0%
putting it into law thank you
representative

06:06:51.530 --> 06:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:53.208 --> 06:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
06:06:55.128 --> 06:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
you very much for joining us again how
 
06:06:56.570 --> 06:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
often did your board vote on
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent contracts
 
06:07:01.610 --> 06:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
when I was on the school board the
 
06:07:03.890 --> 06:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
superintendent had just been hired
 
06:07:06.650 --> 06:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
he got hired in the previous year in
 
06:07:09.708 --> 06:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
2014 and I started I wasn't part of the
 
06:07:09.718 --> 06:07:11.030 align:start position:0%
2014 and I started I wasn't part of the
contract

06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
contract
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
he had just gotten approved before I got
 
06:07:15.170 --> 06:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
on the board but when we when I was
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
there we did uh one one contract every
 
06:07:20.930 --> 06:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
member that we had to approve and we
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
definitely deliberated on that
 
06:07:24.770 --> 06:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
so there was one in the three years I
 
06:07:26.930 --> 06:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
was on the school board okay thank you
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow
 
06:07:30.530 --> 06:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
up paying for were you given the
 
06:07:33.170 --> 06:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh evaluate the
 
06:07:36.830 --> 06:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh I threw you know a
 
06:07:38.690 --> 06:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
personal form that you filed and that
 
06:07:40.368 --> 06:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
went in with the group on the board and
 
06:07:42.650 --> 06:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
the board then Consolidated into uh
 
06:07:44.690 --> 06:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
annual evaluation
 
06:07:47.570 --> 06:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes I was given that opportunity in um
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline SAU 41 we have the
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
halls Brooklyn Co-op which I was a board
 
06:07:53.810 --> 06:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
member we have Brookline in the Hollis
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
school districts and they have their
 
06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
boards so the 17-member SAU board so I
 
06:08:00.770 --> 06:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
was one of 17 voices that made that
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
contributed to the superintendent's
 
06:08:04.368 --> 06:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
evaluation and I yes I did have the
 
06:08:07.610 --> 06:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity I do feel feel that my
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
comments were watered down to some
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
degree when there was things if they
 
06:08:14.690 --> 06:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
weren't you know 100 positive they did
 
06:08:16.128 --> 06:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
some of the things did make it in though
 
06:08:17.810 --> 06:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
so I can't complain too much about that
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
but there's definitely was pressure to
 
06:08:24.830 --> 06:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
say things are all okay and you know I
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
don't think there was that we have you
 
06:08:28.970 --> 06:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
know we did a good job but that I did
 
06:08:31.368 --> 06:08:31.378 align:start position:0%
have an input thank you very much
 
06:08:33.948 --> 06:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
down the line at represent Tanner thank
 
06:08:35.930 --> 06:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
were you are you aware that in New
 
06:08:40.970 --> 06:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that any parent can object to
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
material or books that a student has as
 
06:08:45.590 --> 06:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
part of their curriculum and provide an
 
06:08:48.110 --> 06:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
alternative of their own so I don't
 
06:08:51.948 --> 06:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
understand how your son was forced to
 
06:08:54.048 --> 06:08:54.058 align:start position:0%
read a book that you objected to
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes I don't believe that was that was
 
06:08:58.730 --> 06:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
the case that law was not in place at
 
06:09:00.590 --> 06:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
that point I don't remember when it went
 
06:09:02.030 --> 06:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
into place so this is I'm talking about
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
probably the 2009 time frame when my son
 
06:09:07.610 --> 06:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
was a freshman in high school
 
06:09:09.530 --> 06:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
but I did complain about it and they
 
06:09:13.368 --> 06:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
said yes we will convene a uh committee
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to look at it and it went at the speed
 
06:09:17.570 --> 06:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
of government to be honest and so I
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
complained I believe in January and they
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
finally met as a committee in June and
 
06:09:24.650 --> 06:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit of insult to injury
 
06:09:26.208 --> 06:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
they said just because you complained
 
06:09:27.650 --> 06:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
about it and the committee met and found
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
that it was okay no one else can
 
06:09:31.548 --> 06:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
complain about this book for two years
 
06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
so that that was what that was my
 
06:09:33.240 --> 06:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
so that that was what that was my
experience

06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:38.810 --> 06:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up that's not the case now
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
that's great if it's not the case now
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
hour again
 
06:09:46.680 --> 06:09:49.510 align:start position:0%
hour again
um

06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:52.430 --> 06:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
when you were on the school board
 
06:09:55.250 --> 06:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
did you set standards for behavior for
 
06:09:57.288 --> 06:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
both the school board and the public in
 
06:09:59.570 --> 06:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
attending the meetings
 
06:10:02.448 --> 06:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
standards of behavior
 
06:10:06.410 --> 06:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
the I did not I did not do that we had a
 
06:10:08.330 --> 06:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
I think we had an old policy but we
 
06:10:10.190 --> 06:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
never visited it that was how that would
 
06:10:10.200 --> 06:10:11.390 align:start position:0%
never visited it that was how that would
run

06:10:11.390 --> 06:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
run
 
06:10:13.490 --> 06:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
would you say that it would be
 
06:10:16.368 --> 06:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
reasonable for school boards to be able
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
to have a standard of behavior for
 
06:10:22.970 --> 06:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
school board members and attendees at a
 
06:10:22.980 --> 06:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
school board members and attendees at a
meeting

06:10:24.470 --> 06:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
I believe there should be some standards
 
06:10:29.570 --> 06:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that but I think having
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
school board members being able to
 
06:10:31.320 --> 06:10:32.510 align:start position:0%
school board members being able to
respond

06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
respond
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
directly and not just the chair to a
 
06:10:37.128 --> 06:10:37.138 align:start position:0%
public inquiry
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and that's not the case
 
06:10:44.750 --> 06:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
 
06:10:48.240 --> 06:10:49.310 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
if

06:10:49.310 --> 06:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
people come to a school board meeting
 
06:10:57.410 --> 06:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
and are disruptive interrupting loud
 
06:10:57.420 --> 06:10:58.910 align:start position:0%
and are disruptive interrupting loud
um

06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
yelling out at inappropriate times
 
06:11:04.430 --> 06:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
what recourse do you think a school
 
06:11:05.930 --> 06:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
board would have
 
06:11:09.530 --> 06:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
I believe if a person is being
 
06:11:14.690 --> 06:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
disruptive then they should be asked to
 
06:11:17.208 --> 06:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
leave and then you may have to get law
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement involved potentially if
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's the case but I would take the the
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
the the the the the asking approach
 
06:11:24.840 --> 06:11:30.530 align:start position:0%
the the the the the asking approach
first

06:11:30.530 --> 06:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:32.990 --> 06:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for Jefferson Woodcock
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon sir just a
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
quick question I'm glad about listening
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to your dialogue about your uh concern
 
06:11:42.410 --> 06:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
or your
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
experiences on the school board I also
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
said I sat at a school board for 20
 
06:11:48.110 --> 06:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
years I I understand a little bit what
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying but it seems to me that
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the year are concerned thank
 
06:11:55.548 --> 06:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
you sir that the bulk of your concerns
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
with your interplay within your own
 
06:12:00.170 --> 06:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
school district is a school local school
 
06:12:01.610 --> 06:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
district local school board
 
06:12:04.610 --> 06:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
superintendent discussion you're a
 
06:12:06.890 --> 06:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
muslin or a lack thereof or your ability
 
06:12:08.690 --> 06:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
to put your hand up quietly or ask
 
06:12:11.628 --> 06:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
questions that that's a local school
 
06:12:13.368 --> 06:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
board auction you have a responsibility
 
06:12:15.650 --> 06:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
to speak up to that I'm not sure we need
 
06:12:18.830 --> 06:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
a state law to tell you or the members
 
06:12:19.970 --> 06:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
of the U.S school board or any school
 
06:12:21.708 --> 06:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
board how to interact they're weak boys
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
or strong boys the sweet superintendents
 
06:12:25.788 --> 06:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
a strong superintendents that Dynamic is
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
built every time they have a new
 
06:12:27.000 --> 06:12:28.430 align:start position:0%
built every time they have a new
election

06:12:28.430 --> 06:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
election
 
06:12:30.288 --> 06:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
um so I just find I find that your
 
06:12:31.850 --> 06:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
concerns are legitimate without question
 
06:12:34.250 --> 06:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
legitimate I just think they're they're
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh prescriptive to that one particular
 
06:12:39.410 --> 06:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
board that you had a difficulty time
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
negotiating and not like a a whole law
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
as as here
 
06:12:48.530 --> 06:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
well I think a lot of the policies
 
06:12:51.170 --> 06:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
derive hopefully from Department of
 
06:12:53.570 --> 06:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
Education rules and and also New
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA and a lot of those
 
06:12:59.868 --> 06:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
policies are not developed necessarily
 
06:13:01.610 --> 06:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
by the board but they're the draft
 
06:13:03.770 --> 06:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
language is received from sources like
 
06:13:04.670 --> 06:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire School Board
 
06:13:08.510 --> 06:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
Association maybe not looked at in
 
06:13:10.670 --> 06:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
detail that it needs to be and maybe are
 
06:13:12.590 --> 06:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes approved without careful
 
06:13:14.810 --> 06:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
thought and I think that was one of the
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
cases with this particular time when I
 
06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
was on the board
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that you know you
 
06:13:22.250 --> 06:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
have to look at the policies and you
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
need to revisit them periodically so I
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
think that's a good thing to do and I
 
06:13:28.690 --> 06:13:28.700 align:start position:0%
think if the law
 
06:13:31.730 --> 06:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
causes the right thing to happen it will
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
follow that policies will follow and I
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
think that that's why this this law is
 
06:13:38.048 --> 06:13:38.058 align:start position:0%
so important
 
06:13:41.090 --> 06:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
last question like wouldn't it be the
 
06:13:42.610 --> 06:13:42.620 align:start position:0%
reason your mind wouldn't it be the
 
06:13:45.770 --> 06:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school board to
 
06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
create their own policies and make sure
 
06:13:49.910 --> 06:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they work accurately and that
 
06:13:51.650 --> 06:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
they're evaluated and they're seen on a
 
06:13:53.810 --> 06:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
regular can review on a consistent basis
 
06:13:55.430 --> 06:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
I mean it wouldn't that be responsible
 
06:13:58.970 --> 06:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
your own board for your policies
 
06:14:01.010 --> 06:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
the school board should be doing that
 
06:14:02.990 --> 06:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
and they follow the guidance of the law
 
06:14:04.850 --> 06:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the law needs to help
 
06:14:08.270 --> 06:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
guide that a little bit to to allow the
 
06:14:11.270 --> 06:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
right thing to happen in terms of the
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
right to speak as a school board member
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
the right to have a dissenting opinion
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
and also the all the other things that
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli's bill has in
 
06:14:19.680 --> 06:14:22.548 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli's bill has in
it

06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%

06:14:51.010 --> 06:14:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm serious with questions let's say
 
06:14:57.590 --> 06:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.128 --> 06:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
let me ask a few questions then
 
06:15:03.170 --> 06:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
um we know we're living in an
 
06:15:05.390 --> 06:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
environment where
 
06:15:08.810 --> 06:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of political conflict
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
is what uh is being communicated to us
 
06:15:16.610 --> 06:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
a result of an ongoing issue prior in
 
06:15:18.770 --> 06:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
all this in the last several years other
 
06:15:21.470 --> 06:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
the communication the the the issue
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
about comments to the school board uh
 
06:15:26.990 --> 06:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
comments of a person that's a minority
 
06:15:29.448 --> 06:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
on a school board sure Etc is that
 
06:15:32.810 --> 06:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
something unique to this Frame of time
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with right now in our life
 
06:15:38.570 --> 06:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
or was it preceding that and have you
 
06:15:41.570 --> 06:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
got any information back from Statewide
 
06:15:43.730 --> 06:15:43.740 align:start position:0%

06:15:53.628 --> 06:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
ask that directly but relative to some
 
06:15:55.850 --> 06:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
of the comments that were made earlier I
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%

I've got some more
 
06:16:32.470 --> 06:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
we have sample policies on reviewing
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%

06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
sample policies about if a parent
 
06:16:38.208 --> 06:16:38.218 align:start position:0%

06:16:41.090 --> 06:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
can come and make a complaint or make a
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
a request for it to be reviewed we have
 
06:16:46.128 --> 06:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
public comment policies
 
06:16:47.288 --> 06:16:47.298 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:16:49.548 --> 06:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
the things that are in the bill is I
 
06:16:51.650 --> 06:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
believe representative Porter it was you
 
06:16:54.350 --> 06:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
that was that said your school board was
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
already doing these things and
 
06:16:57.708 --> 06:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I presume that
 
06:16:59.990 --> 06:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
was some of the same representative luno
 
06:17:01.190 --> 06:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
I presume that was some of the same
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli were on a school
 
06:17:04.490 --> 06:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
board in Connecticut I believe sir I
 
06:17:05.750 --> 06:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
presume they were already doing these
 
06:17:07.610 --> 06:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
things representative Litchfield
 
06:17:07.620 --> 06:17:09.410 align:start position:0%
things representative Litchfield
representative

06:17:09.410 --> 06:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:17:11.810 --> 06:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
so ask yourself if your board was
 
06:17:14.090 --> 06:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
already doing some of these things if it
 
06:17:17.628 --> 06:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
was fantastic and if it was why not was
 
06:17:19.128 --> 06:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
it because the law didn't you require
 
06:17:21.890 --> 06:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
you to do it was it because your board
 
06:17:23.448 --> 06:17:23.458 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do it which is a
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
completely different issue altogether so
 
06:17:28.670 --> 06:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
to your question representative Ladd I
 
06:17:31.490 --> 06:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
guess about the public comment issues
 
06:17:31.500 --> 06:17:32.270 align:start position:0%
guess about the public comment issues
um

06:17:32.270 --> 06:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:37.610 --> 06:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
you know covid really engaged really the
 
06:17:40.610 --> 06:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
one thing that I think kovid if there
 
06:17:41.628 --> 06:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
was one band I'm trying to think the
 
06:17:42.890 --> 06:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
right way to say this if there was one
 
06:17:45.048 --> 06:17:45.058 align:start position:0%
benefit from covid I think it got
 
06:17:48.170 --> 06:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
parents more engaged um with attending
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
local school board meetings now
 
06:17:52.070 --> 06:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
obviously the virtual option certainly
 
06:17:53.690 --> 06:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
helped that out right we couldn't go
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere and go outside anyway so we sit
 
06:17:57.410 --> 06:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
and sat and watch the zoom meeting but
 
06:17:59.330 --> 06:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
that was also very issue specific
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to know about I'm
 
06:18:02.270 --> 06:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Hopson I forgot
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
about your work on the school board as
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
well too I did not mean to exclude you
 
06:18:07.368 --> 06:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
from from going around the table
 
06:18:08.570 --> 06:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
parents wanted to know about masking
 
06:18:12.288 --> 06:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
they wanted to know about social
 
06:18:13.850 --> 06:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
distancing they wanted to know about
 
06:18:16.368 --> 06:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
remote or in-person or virtual or things
 
06:18:18.410 --> 06:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
of that nature that's why we had so many
 
06:18:19.788 --> 06:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
people attending school board meetings
 
06:18:21.890 --> 06:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I have I have some of my own
 
06:18:27.048 --> 06:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
thoughts um about
 
06:18:28.250 --> 06:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
um some of the events at school board
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
meetings I guess mostly this past summer
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
and fall
 
06:18:35.030 --> 06:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
um they were disruptive people were out
 
06:18:36.890 --> 06:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
of order school board members were being
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
called Nazis they were being called uh
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh Communists they were being accused
 
06:18:45.288 --> 06:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
of of uh illegally restraining children
 
06:18:47.650 --> 06:18:47.660 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
06:18:50.750 --> 06:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
126-u I believe it is
 
06:18:54.170 --> 06:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I
 
06:18:56.930 --> 06:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
social media Stokes a lot of this it's
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
easier now to get a message out it's
 
06:19:03.010 --> 06:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
easier now to be anonymous if you will
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
keyboard Warriors you don't have to come
 
06:19:07.368 --> 06:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
to the school board meeting you don't
 
06:19:08.930 --> 06:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
have to write a letter to superintendent
 
06:19:10.430 --> 06:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to write a letter to the
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
principal or make a phone call and be
 
06:19:14.750 --> 06:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
polite and be respectful and follow some
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
rules of decorum you can crap all over
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
people on on Facebook and and and and
 
06:19:23.448 --> 06:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
and and and and engage and and let your
 
06:19:25.610 --> 06:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
anger flow there without any you know
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
without actually having to deal with
 
06:19:29.570 --> 06:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
anything or reach any sort of resolution
 
06:19:31.910 --> 06:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that's to one question
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
I mean we have policies that address all
 
06:19:35.390 --> 06:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
of these things some school board
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
members are involved in curricular
 
06:19:39.410 --> 06:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
decisions or some school boards take an
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
active role in in in in curricular
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
decisions others don't
 
06:19:47.208 --> 06:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
you know I always ask you know we have
 
06:19:49.730 --> 06:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
educational experts as well too we have
 
06:19:51.230 --> 06:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
superintendents and principals with
 
06:19:52.730 --> 06:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
Advanced degrees who know about
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum assessment and instruction I
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
know about the law I don't know anything
 
06:19:57.120 --> 06:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
know about the law I don't know anything
about

06:19:58.310 --> 06:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:20:00.170 --> 06:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
assessing students when I get those
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions from school board members who
 
06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
do you think I passed them off to so you
 
06:20:05.570 --> 06:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
have to talk to your superintendent and
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
your principal I'm not an educational
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
expert fortunately we have Miss Wilson
 
06:20:11.868 --> 06:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
on our staff now who has
 
06:20:14.390 --> 06:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
um multiple certifications from from the
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so if we get
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
something questioned from a school board
 
06:20:19.788 --> 06:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
member that relates to curriculum
 
06:20:22.368 --> 06:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
instruction or assessment Becky can also
 
06:20:24.170 --> 06:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
often often handle it because she has
 
06:20:25.670 --> 06:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
that background and expertise I don't
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
have my attorney handle that I certainly
 
06:20:29.150 --> 06:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't handle that
 
06:20:32.810 --> 06:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
so you know I school boards have been
 
06:20:35.330 --> 06:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
under significant attack the last couple
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
of years these are elected officials
 
06:20:40.310 --> 06:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
just like you half this committee has
 
06:20:42.350 --> 06:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
been on a local school board
 
06:20:44.208 --> 06:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
were you trying to silence your
 
06:20:45.708 --> 06:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
constituent or were you trying to do the
 
06:20:47.330 --> 06:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
best that you could do and are people
 
06:20:48.770 --> 06:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
trying to do the best they could do in
 
06:20:51.708 --> 06:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
times of a pandemic in times of uh
 
06:20:54.350 --> 06:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
fabricated allegations of what's being
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
taught in our Public Schools it's not
 
06:20:59.090 --> 06:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
easy these people volunteer their time
 
06:21:00.890 --> 06:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
how many hours a week representative do
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
you spend dealing with your local school
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
board 10 15 possibly
 
06:21:07.070 --> 06:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
easily and you do it for free and you do
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
it without being at home with your kids
 
06:21:12.890 --> 06:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
right you know the behavior that we've
 
06:21:14.990 --> 06:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
seen at school board meetings last
 
06:21:16.490 --> 06:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
summer and last fall
 
06:21:18.350 --> 06:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
that would never be tolerated in this
 
06:21:20.570 --> 06:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
room it would never be tolerated in this
 
06:21:20.580 --> 06:21:21.470 align:start position:0%
room it would never be tolerated in this
room

06:21:21.470 --> 06:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
06:21:23.330 --> 06:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
if I stood up and started yelling and
 
06:21:25.010 --> 06:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
screaming or representative cordelli was
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
introduced in this bill
 
06:21:28.250 --> 06:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
somebody would have called security that
 
06:21:30.470 --> 06:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
would have been escorted out of here
 
06:21:33.650 --> 06:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
I have strong objections about the bill
 
06:21:36.170 --> 06:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
it impacts my livelihood impacts my
 
06:21:36.180 --> 06:21:37.010 align:start position:0%
it impacts my livelihood impacts my
family

06:21:37.010 --> 06:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:21:39.170 --> 06:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
I don't get to yell and scream because I
 
06:21:41.208 --> 06:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
don't get my way I don't get to yell and
 
06:21:42.530 --> 06:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
scream because I'm being disruptive
 
06:21:44.270 --> 06:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
about something that I don't necessarily
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
like especially in front of a group of
 
06:21:47.990 --> 06:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
five people that are your neighbors that
 
06:21:49.368 --> 06:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
are doing the best that they possibly
 
06:21:49.378 --> 06:21:51.830 align:start position:0%
are doing the best that they possibly
can

06:21:51.830 --> 06:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know we got very little guidance
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
about masking
 
06:21:57.948 --> 06:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
06:22:01.010 --> 06:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
no mandates what were we told what were
 
06:22:02.510 --> 06:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
we told by the governor and the
 
06:22:05.090 --> 06:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner local decision local
 
06:22:05.100 --> 06:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner local decision local
decision

06:22:06.830 --> 06:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:22:09.650 --> 06:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
so it's left to the local school
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
districts I won't get into my own
 
06:22:13.850 --> 06:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
thoughts as to why that was done
 
06:22:17.208 --> 06:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
but you know we were told by people in
 
06:22:19.310 --> 06:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
charge that we were on our own
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
and lay people not MediCal experts not
 
06:22:24.650 --> 06:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
educational experts people overseeing
 
06:22:27.530 --> 06:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
the budget adopting policies trying to
 
06:22:28.910 --> 06:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
do their best
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
are disparaged by some of our
 
06:22:33.890 --> 06:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
politicians not always supported by our
 
06:22:36.650 --> 06:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats not always supported by the
 
06:22:36.660 --> 06:22:37.610 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats not always supported by the
media

06:22:37.610 --> 06:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
media
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
disparaged on social media
 
06:22:48.048 --> 06:22:48.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:50.208 --> 06:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much uh Barrett you
 
06:22:52.190 --> 06:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
know I I think that just goes through
 
06:22:55.368 --> 06:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
the the what's going on and
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
I for one want to thank you the state
 
06:23:01.548 --> 06:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
06:23:04.430 --> 06:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
for quickly responding
 
06:23:06.288 --> 06:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
to the National
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
and how you did that
 
06:23:08.400 --> 06:23:10.090 align:start position:0%
and how you did that
and

06:23:10.090 --> 06:23:10.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:13.730 --> 06:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
that set at what I think
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh us on the right path
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I understand how difficult it is on
 
06:23:22.010 --> 06:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
these school boards they are elected
 
06:23:22.020 --> 06:23:23.208 align:start position:0%
these school boards they are elected
officials

06:23:23.208 --> 06:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
officials
 
06:23:26.930 --> 06:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
coming from all kinds of walks of life
 
06:23:29.470 --> 06:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
and they're human
 
06:23:31.730 --> 06:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
we got to resolve our issues our
 
06:23:33.230 --> 06:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
problems there's got to be a way of
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
doing it and the policies I've seen many
 
06:23:37.490 --> 06:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
of your boilerplate policies
 
06:23:39.350 --> 06:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore the local school boards
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
then to make them more relevant to their
 
06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
particular Town correct so with that um
 
06:23:45.948 --> 06:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open this up to other
 
06:23:48.310 --> 06:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions that may come from the
 
06:23:51.650 --> 06:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
committee here represent boom
 
06:23:52.970 --> 06:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
I agree most of these when I was on the
 
06:23:59.628 --> 06:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
school board we did most of this stuff
 
06:24:02.330 --> 06:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
but now it's the some School Board need
 
06:24:04.850 --> 06:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
my own where some of this stuff
 
06:24:07.250 --> 06:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
the theory lead us then they know better
 
06:24:09.948 --> 06:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
than anybody else so don't you think
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
that putting this stuff in law will help
 
06:24:12.540 --> 06:24:13.670 align:start position:0%
that putting this stuff in law will help
you

06:24:13.670 --> 06:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:24:16.070 --> 06:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
at school bus for the policies and
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
whatnot your policies can point to this
 
06:24:21.470 --> 06:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative I mean I suppose that's
 
06:24:25.610 --> 06:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
one way of looking at it if but you know
 
06:24:27.288 --> 06:24:27.298 align:start position:0%
relative to the concerns you have with
 
06:24:28.610 --> 06:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
your local school board that's an
 
06:24:30.170 --> 06:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
election issue that's not a statutory
 
06:24:32.030 --> 06:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
issue you vote for different people
 
06:24:34.730 --> 06:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
there's also a provision in here about
 
06:24:37.250 --> 06:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
um uh uh adhering to I believe ethical
 
06:24:39.288 --> 06:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
standards or whatever the languages we
 
06:24:41.448 --> 06:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
had a school board ethics uh bill I
 
06:24:42.350 --> 06:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
think two years ago and I believe
 
06:24:43.548 --> 06:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
there's another one coming back this
 
06:24:45.410 --> 06:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
year I remember you saying your ethics
 
06:24:47.510 --> 06:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
are between you and your constituents if
 
06:24:48.708 --> 06:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
they don't like the job you're doing
 
06:24:50.570 --> 06:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
they'll vote for somebody else I think
 
06:24:54.288 --> 06:24:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thank you um
 
06:25:00.910 --> 06:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
Mr typically at the start of your
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
presentation you indicate a little bit
 
06:25:05.208 --> 06:25:05.218 align:start position:0%
differently than you did today you can
 
06:25:07.970 --> 06:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
only give us your uh your association's
 
06:25:09.470 --> 06:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
position on the bill we haven't heard
 
06:25:09.480 --> 06:25:10.670 align:start position:0%
position on the bill we haven't heard
that

06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:25:12.230 --> 06:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking a position on this
 
06:25:13.970 --> 06:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
bill representative Woodcock if we
 
06:25:15.170 --> 06:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill we're going to be
 
06:25:17.208 --> 06:25:17.218 align:start position:0%
labeled as being anti-parent if we
 
06:25:19.250 --> 06:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
support the bill we're going to be
 
06:25:21.170 --> 06:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be that we support all
 
06:25:23.208 --> 06:25:23.218 align:start position:0%
the things in here so I'm not taking a
 
06:25:24.530 --> 06:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
position on this bill so there's no
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
position on the bill okay thank you for
 
06:25:29.510 --> 06:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I have one more yes you may um I I
 
06:25:31.548 --> 06:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
concur with your your thinking when you
 
06:25:33.530 --> 06:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
talk to representative a moment ago and
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
local school boys should take care of
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
local school boys
 
06:25:37.200 --> 06:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
local school boys
um

06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:40.670 --> 06:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
is there and I know from listening to
 
06:25:41.628 --> 06:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
you over the last couple of years
 
06:25:45.288 --> 06:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
there's a more
 
06:25:47.448 --> 06:25:47.458 align:start position:0%
85 you notice that I don't know number
 
06:25:48.948 --> 06:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
of school boys are affiliate your
 
06:25:48.958 --> 06:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
of school boys are affiliate your
organization

06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:25:52.970 --> 06:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
certainly there were 176 school boards
 
06:25:55.548 --> 06:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
in the state we have 161 members that
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
are school boards most of the most of
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
the districts that are not members or
 
06:26:01.128 --> 06:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
some districts that do not have schools
 
06:26:03.470 --> 06:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
they don't operate a school some of this
 
06:26:04.670 --> 06:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing up in the mountains some of the
 
06:26:06.048 --> 06:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
smaller restaurants and I appreciate the
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
fact that your boy does put out sample
 
06:26:09.288 --> 06:26:09.298 align:start position:0%
policies and that the local school
 
06:26:11.628 --> 06:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
committees then can use those as a stock
 
06:26:13.850 --> 06:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
as a guidelines of Base play my question
 
06:26:16.010 --> 06:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
is have you does your Association
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
typically work with superintendents or
 
06:26:21.470 --> 06:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
school boards uh in an orientation
 
06:26:24.170 --> 06:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
package for new members and those things
 
06:26:26.750 --> 06:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
also included in there uh thank you for
 
06:26:29.750 --> 06:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the question representative yes we do
 
06:26:29.760 --> 06:26:30.470 align:start position:0%
the question representative yes we do
um

06:26:30.470 --> 06:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
we do multiple trainings every year
 
06:26:35.330 --> 06:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
between my staff attorney and I anywhere
 
06:26:38.570 --> 06:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
between I'd say 50 and 80 trainings for
 
06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
local school boards every year we do a
 
06:26:43.010 --> 06:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
number of webinars uh most of our
 
06:26:44.570 --> 06:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
training is when I say the 50 to 80
 
06:26:46.970 --> 06:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
those are in person where
 
06:26:48.530 --> 06:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
um a superintendent or School Board
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
chair will call us and we will go out to
 
06:26:52.368 --> 06:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
visit their local school district and do
 
06:26:53.990 --> 06:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
a training on whatever topic that they
 
06:26:56.690 --> 06:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
want we do do what we call our new
 
06:26:59.150 --> 06:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
school board member orientation training
 
06:27:01.128 --> 06:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
It's usually the end of April beginning
 
06:27:04.128 --> 06:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
of May following March elections we let
 
06:27:05.570 --> 06:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
the board members kind of get come on
 
06:27:07.448 --> 06:27:07.458 align:start position:0%
get used to it
 
06:27:10.368 --> 06:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
so we used to do that in person in
 
06:27:10.378 --> 06:27:11.390 align:start position:0%
so we used to do that in person in
Concord

06:27:11.390 --> 06:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
um around that time of year we'd get
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
about 120 people on average from across
 
06:27:18.590 --> 06:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state when covet hit obviously all
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
of our training went virtual and zoom so
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're continuing that now last year we
 
06:27:24.830 --> 06:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
did a zoom in this year we're doing all
 
06:27:26.090 --> 06:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
of our webinar we're still doing those
 
06:27:27.948 --> 06:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
via Zoom there's no point in asking
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to travel to Concord when we
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
can hop on on a hop on a computer and do
 
06:27:35.690 --> 06:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
a webinar that way but we do in terms of
 
06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
the roles and responsibilities and
 
06:27:38.690 --> 06:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
orientation type training I've already
 
06:27:40.128 --> 06:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
done a couple
 
06:27:41.390 --> 06:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
um you know Manchester has their
 
06:27:43.128 --> 06:27:43.138 align:start position:0%
elections in November we already went
 
06:27:45.048 --> 06:27:45.058 align:start position:0%
down into training for them
 
06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
um I did one for Dover
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
um maybe a month or so ago I had one
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled for Portsmouth because their
 
06:27:53.750 --> 06:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
cities do elections um unfortunately
 
06:27:55.548 --> 06:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
that had to get canceled something else
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
came up but we do dozens and dozens and
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
dozens of these a year
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your work on
 
06:28:04.670 --> 06:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state thank you
 
06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further question
 
06:28:11.570 --> 06:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
your your mic on Oliver
 
06:28:20.208 --> 06:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:20.218 --> 06:28:21.410 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:28:21.410 --> 06:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
06:28:27.110 --> 06:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
we seem to be stuck on an air thing that
 
06:28:29.030 --> 06:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
occur I haven't really heard of the
 
06:28:29.040 --> 06:28:30.048 align:start position:0%
occur I haven't really heard of the
express

06:28:30.048 --> 06:28:30.058 align:start position:0%
express
 
06:28:32.090 --> 06:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if something in the
 
06:28:35.330 --> 06:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
law discussing a requirement
 
06:28:37.330 --> 06:28:37.340 align:start position:0%
that people be
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
civilized and that irritable language
 
06:28:43.430 --> 06:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
angry language and all will not be
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
tolerated yeah it's not tolerated in
 
06:28:47.090 --> 06:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
courts of law
 
06:28:49.670 --> 06:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's not tolerated really even in
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
churches they'll get you for disruption
 
06:28:55.128 --> 06:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
however heartfelt your anguish
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have to express it clearly calmly
 
06:29:00.110 --> 06:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully to someone with whom you
 
06:29:01.610 --> 06:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
may disagree
 
06:29:05.570 --> 06:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
we do it here all the time every day
 
06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
however exciting thing might be on the
 
06:29:07.680 --> 06:29:08.390 align:start position:0%
however exciting thing might be on the
point

06:29:08.390 --> 06:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:29:08.400 --> 06:29:09.650 align:start position:0%
point
but

06:29:09.650 --> 06:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:29:12.830 --> 06:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to me to be
 
06:29:15.650 --> 06:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
too high a thing too hard a thing to
 
06:29:17.628 --> 06:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
require that people comport themselves
 
06:29:21.230 --> 06:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
civilly in a public discourse such as a
 
06:29:23.690 --> 06:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
school board meeting sure and then would
 
06:29:25.670 --> 06:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
it I guess I'm asking you would it be
 
06:29:28.670 --> 06:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
helpful if that were in law for school
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
boards to Simply say You must calm down
 
06:29:33.170 --> 06:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
or we'll have you removed and just
 
06:29:35.650 --> 06:29:35.660 align:start position:0%
simply not move until the person
 
06:29:38.030 --> 06:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question uh
 
06:29:39.650 --> 06:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative we certainly saw a lot of
 
06:29:42.590 --> 06:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
that last last summer and fall
 
06:29:46.070 --> 06:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
um the challenge with crafting a public
 
06:29:49.730 --> 06:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
comment policy is that you run into a
 
06:29:52.850 --> 06:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
myriad of First Amendment issues you
 
06:29:54.948 --> 06:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
cannot mandate somebody to be quote
 
06:29:57.048 --> 06:29:57.058 align:start position:0%
unquote civil
 
06:29:59.990 --> 06:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you know and as elected officials uh
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know you can regulate
 
06:30:05.570 --> 06:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
obscene speech vulgar speech is kind of
 
06:30:07.788 --> 06:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's on that's that's a little that's
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit iffy
 
06:30:11.090 --> 06:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
um you know some courts have said vulgar
 
06:30:13.250 --> 06:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
speech can be disallowed other courts
 
06:30:15.230 --> 06:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
have said it's going to be a matter of
 
06:30:15.240 --> 06:30:17.150 align:start position:0%
have said it's going to be a matter of
context

06:30:17.150 --> 06:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
context
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you know if you know if I'm walking
 
06:30:21.470 --> 06:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
away from the microphone I go
 
06:30:23.570 --> 06:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative 40 or an a-hole you know
 
06:30:25.010 --> 06:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably not going to get
 
06:30:26.990 --> 06:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
me arrested if I walk up to you and put
 
06:30:28.250 --> 06:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
my finger in your face and yell and
 
06:30:30.110 --> 06:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
scream and say the same thing I might
 
06:30:31.730 --> 06:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:30:31.740 --> 06:30:34.490 align:start position:0%
you know
um

06:30:34.490 --> 06:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:39.830 --> 06:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
so um anyway you know any nhsba we did a
 
06:30:43.368 --> 06:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive webinar I want to I
 
06:30:44.750 --> 06:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
want to say it was the middle of
 
06:30:44.760 --> 06:30:46.010 align:start position:0%
want to say it was the middle of
September

06:30:46.010 --> 06:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
September
 
06:30:49.250 --> 06:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
um on how to manage your meeting rules
 
06:30:51.650 --> 06:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
for public comment and walking through
 
06:30:53.868 --> 06:30:53.878 align:start position:0%
the steps of if you have to call the
 
06:30:55.730 --> 06:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
police because there are most of these
 
06:30:57.288 --> 06:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is people that have
 
06:30:59.150 --> 06:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
may have been arrested it's a disorderly
 
06:31:02.090 --> 06:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
conduct charge under whatever RSA is it
 
06:31:05.690 --> 06:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
644 colon 2 or 664 colon two I forget
 
06:31:07.368 --> 06:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
what it is but you know we certainly
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
told our our members that's the absolute
 
06:31:12.350 --> 06:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
Last Resort that's the absolute Last
 
06:31:15.170 --> 06:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
Resort just having a you know call the
 
06:31:17.208 --> 06:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
other challenge too is that as you said
 
06:31:20.390 --> 06:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know wait until they become civil
 
06:31:22.010 --> 06:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
I mean we had school board meetings with
 
06:31:24.590 --> 06:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
150 200 people who had no interest in
 
06:31:26.270 --> 06:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
being civil the purpose was to disrupt
 
06:31:27.708 --> 06:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
the meeting and the purpose was to
 
06:31:28.850 --> 06:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
prevent the school board from doing
 
06:31:29.868 --> 06:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
their business
 
06:31:31.990 --> 06:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
06:31:34.788 --> 06:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative the bill has some some
 
06:31:37.090 --> 06:31:37.100 align:start position:0%
Provisions about public comment periods
 
06:31:39.470 --> 06:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
multiple public comment periods through
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
the course of the meeting and I believe
 
06:31:43.010 --> 06:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell you had mentioned
 
06:31:44.448 --> 06:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
some boards will have them at the end of
 
06:31:46.010 --> 06:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
the meeting maybe 10 or 10 30 and
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
parents you know I have to go home and
 
06:31:49.250 --> 06:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
intend with the kids if we have multiple
 
06:31:50.690 --> 06:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
public comment hearings the meeting's
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to last until midnight anyway so
 
06:31:55.610 --> 06:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
at one point I mean that's sort of the
 
06:31:57.170 --> 06:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
06:31:59.868 --> 06:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
of of putting parameters around public
 
06:32:02.150 --> 06:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
comments is that it's a business meeting
 
06:32:04.010 --> 06:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
of the board the board has to get this
 
06:32:06.048 --> 06:32:06.058 align:start position:0%
business done it has to approve its
 
06:32:07.788 --> 06:32:07.798 align:start position:0%
policy it's have to approve its budget
 
06:32:11.030 --> 06:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
accept reports things of that nature you
 
06:32:13.548 --> 06:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
know to say nothing of the fact that
 
06:32:15.170 --> 06:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
there are other avenues of communication
 
06:32:18.410 --> 06:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
you can always email you know ever most
 
06:32:20.330 --> 06:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
School boards have and I get there were
 
06:32:22.190 --> 06:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that they don't email me back
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
they don't email me back many school
 
06:32:26.270 --> 06:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
boards will have the the the the school
 
06:32:27.530 --> 06:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
board members phone number and email
 
06:32:30.048 --> 06:32:30.058 align:start position:0%
address on the website and if you don't
 
06:32:31.970 --> 06:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
get a response from back from your
 
06:32:34.368 --> 06:32:34.378 align:start position:0%
elected official
 
06:32:35.868 --> 06:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
come March they're going to hear about
 
06:32:37.250 --> 06:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
it because they're not going to be
 
06:32:40.548 --> 06:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be reelected again
 
06:32:42.708 --> 06:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
personal demeanor but I would ask you
 
06:32:42.718 --> 06:32:44.330 align:start position:0%
personal demeanor but I would ask you
respectfully

06:32:44.330 --> 06:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
06:32:46.910 --> 06:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
what if you had as an alternative we
 
06:32:49.250 --> 06:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
will tolerate this to a point at which
 
06:32:52.010 --> 06:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
point we'll go into oppose me and simply
 
06:32:54.590 --> 06:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
do it and go into a closed meeting sir I
 
06:32:56.510 --> 06:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
mean the right to know law doesn't allow
 
06:32:58.190 --> 06:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
that right the public has a right to
 
06:33:00.048 --> 06:33:00.058 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting
 
06:33:02.570 --> 06:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's the RSA 91a the public has a
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:07.548 --> 06:33:07.558 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
06:33:09.470 --> 06:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in law that requires
 
06:33:11.570 --> 06:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
right now there's nothing in New
 
06:33:13.128 --> 06:33:13.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that requires a public
 
06:33:16.430 --> 06:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
body and let's that's another aspect you
 
06:33:17.810 --> 06:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
know can we if we're going to be talking
 
06:33:19.610 --> 06:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
about public bodies having
 
06:33:22.390 --> 06:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
having public hearings can we please
 
06:33:25.990 --> 06:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate that to include towns cities
 
06:33:28.910 --> 06:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
and you know this committee doesn't take
 
06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
public comment either respectfully
 
06:33:33.650 --> 06:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
I say that so but I'm just you know
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
school boards are the target for this
 
06:33:37.070 --> 06:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
when you know if we're going to be
 
06:33:38.270 --> 06:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
talking about public comments and
 
06:33:40.128 --> 06:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
implicating the right to no law in First
 
06:33:41.930 --> 06:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment law it should apply to all
 
06:33:45.650 --> 06:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:48.650 --> 06:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh further
 
06:33:52.788 --> 06:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much Barrett
 
06:33:54.600 --> 06:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much Barrett
representative

06:33:56.150 --> 06:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:33:58.910 --> 06:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
use me right beside me
 
06:34:00.590 --> 06:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
hi there thank you for taking my
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to start by saying I hear
 
06:34:05.930 --> 06:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
your passion
 
06:34:05.940 --> 06:34:06.530 align:start position:0%
your passion
um

06:34:06.530 --> 06:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:08.510 --> 06:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I agree you're in a no-win situation
 
06:34:11.208 --> 06:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and after listening
 
06:34:13.250 --> 06:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
to you speak today we've been working
 
06:34:15.890 --> 06:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
together kind of for years I wish I had
 
06:34:17.810 --> 06:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
reached out to you years ago to be
 
06:34:19.548 --> 06:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest with you
 
06:34:19.558 --> 06:34:20.510 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest with you
um

06:34:20.510 --> 06:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:20.520 --> 06:34:21.890 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:34:21.890 --> 06:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:34:24.650 --> 06:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to wrap this concern into a
 
06:34:24.660 --> 06:34:26.150 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to wrap this concern into a
question

06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:34:30.830 --> 06:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and and basically let me start with I
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
do believe that there is for example a
 
06:34:35.570 --> 06:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
sample agenda out there a policy of a
 
06:34:37.850 --> 06:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
sample agenda that does state from the
 
06:34:39.170 --> 06:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire School Board Association
 
06:34:42.048 --> 06:34:42.058 align:start position:0%
it is suggested that people do not make
 
06:34:44.930 --> 06:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me that public comment be related
 
06:34:47.868 --> 06:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
to items on the agenda so I want to put
 
06:34:51.410 --> 06:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
that out there first secondly new school
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
board members they do receive if it's
 
06:34:55.490 --> 06:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
still being printed there's a pretty
 
06:34:58.730 --> 06:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
thick manual a yellow manual
 
06:35:01.610 --> 06:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
um right what is expected or how to be a
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
good school board member and I know
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
because I carried about four years how
 
06:35:06.048 --> 06:35:06.058 align:start position:0%
to be a better okay becoming a better
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
board member board member um it was my
 
06:35:10.850 --> 06:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
Bible for years but to be perfectly
 
06:35:12.350 --> 06:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
honest with you I felt it was quite
 
06:35:15.170 --> 06:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
vague there is initial training by the
 
06:35:18.948 --> 06:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
School Board Association but yet
 
06:35:22.730 --> 06:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I find that within that training and
 
06:35:24.590 --> 06:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
it could be by default board members are
 
06:35:26.390 --> 06:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
often led to believe that they work for
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and not the other way
 
06:35:33.170 --> 06:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
around so that being said with this
 
06:35:35.770 --> 06:35:35.780 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation
 
06:35:39.048 --> 06:35:39.058 align:start position:0%
I'm at a loss at how this is not a good
 
06:35:40.610 --> 06:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
thing because it could be incorporated
 
06:35:43.310 --> 06:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
for example into that publication that
 
06:35:45.170 --> 06:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
is given to board members it could be
 
06:35:48.288 --> 06:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the training and if
 
06:35:50.270 --> 06:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that we don't go with
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation how do you
 
06:35:54.770 --> 06:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
suggest that we convey this message at
 
06:35:56.270 --> 06:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
this point in time sure thank you very
 
06:35:58.128 --> 06:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
um first to to your first question about
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
NH and nhsba Sample policy recommending
 
06:36:08.570 --> 06:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
that uh uh public comment be limited to
 
06:36:10.670 --> 06:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
agenda items only
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
um that was necessary because we had a
 
06:36:16.368 --> 06:36:16.378 align:start position:0%
period in time when
 
06:36:18.410 --> 06:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
um we had many
 
06:36:20.448 --> 06:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
um we had people coming to public
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
meetings and publicly disparaging staff
 
06:36:25.850 --> 06:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
members calling out third grade teachers
 
06:36:28.128 --> 06:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
calling out the principal
 
06:36:30.288 --> 06:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
um which when school boards deal with
 
06:36:32.690 --> 06:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
employee matters as you know their own
 
06:36:34.610 --> 06:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
non-public session everything we do
 
06:36:37.010 --> 06:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
hiring firing investigations all done in
 
06:36:39.590 --> 06:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
non-public session so
 
06:36:41.690 --> 06:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
our rationale was that it did not make
 
06:36:43.010 --> 06:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
sense for the school board public
 
06:36:43.020 --> 06:36:44.770 align:start position:0%
sense for the school board public
comment

06:36:44.770 --> 06:36:44.780 align:start position:0%
comment
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
portion to be a vehicle for people to
 
06:36:50.330 --> 06:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
come and publicly disparage
 
06:36:51.948 --> 06:36:51.958 align:start position:0%
publicly disparaged School District
 
06:36:55.128 --> 06:36:55.138 align:start position:0%
employees so by limiting public comment
 
06:36:57.530 --> 06:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
to agenda items only you're never
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
putting employee matters on the agenda
 
06:37:01.850 --> 06:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
are you your agenda will say non-public
 
06:37:04.010 --> 06:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
non-public session following the meeting
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
so that was a way to ensure that public
 
06:37:09.708 --> 06:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
that school board meetings did not
 
06:37:12.650 --> 06:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
become vehicles or avenues for people
 
06:37:14.510 --> 06:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
just to come and complain publicly
 
06:37:17.090 --> 06:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
complain about their teachers as we said
 
06:37:18.830 --> 06:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
there are other avenues for discussion
 
06:37:20.150 --> 06:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you have a problem with your teacher
 
06:37:21.530 --> 06:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
talk to the principal if you have a
 
06:37:23.690 --> 06:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
problem with if it's not resolved
 
06:37:26.208 --> 06:37:26.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps talk to the superintendent
 
06:37:27.650 --> 06:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:37:29.448 --> 06:37:29.458 align:start position:0%
depending on the nature of the issue it
 
06:37:30.890 --> 06:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
may come up to the school board for a
 
06:37:32.208 --> 06:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
conversation or a hearing or something
 
06:37:35.090 --> 06:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
along those lines as well too becoming a
 
06:37:37.490 --> 06:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
better board member um uh you know
 
06:37:39.530 --> 06:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's a national publication I mean
 
06:37:40.670 --> 06:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not going to fit every
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
state because every state has its own
 
06:37:45.170 --> 06:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know various laws about school board
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
governance and things of that nature
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's helpful it's intended to be a guide
 
06:37:52.490 --> 06:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the end-all be-all you know
 
06:37:54.530 --> 06:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
we're relative to that though you know I
 
06:37:55.910 --> 06:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
often say that being a school board
 
06:37:58.610 --> 06:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
member is an art not a science you know
 
06:38:00.048 --> 06:38:00.058 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be black and white
 
06:38:02.208 --> 06:38:02.218 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be
 
06:38:04.970 --> 06:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
um you know rigid rigid rules that you
 
06:38:06.590 --> 06:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow every single time there needs to
 
06:38:08.390 --> 06:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
be Nuance there's going to be history
 
06:38:10.610 --> 06:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
there's going to be local communities
 
06:38:13.670 --> 06:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
and local customs and last I guess to
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the issue to your question about you
 
06:38:20.030 --> 06:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
know would this bill sort of help the
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
nhsba training and some of the other
 
06:38:24.170 --> 06:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
training docs and whatnot you know I
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
guess if we're talking about the bill
 
06:38:27.288 --> 06:38:27.298 align:start position:0%
specifically you know where it says the
 
06:38:29.410 --> 06:38:29.420 align:start position:0%
school board shall be responsible for
 
06:38:32.150 --> 06:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum textbook approvals adoption
 
06:38:34.670 --> 06:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
of educational standards I mean I guess
 
06:38:37.010 --> 06:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
it sort of gets back to some comments I
 
06:38:39.048 --> 06:38:39.058 align:start position:0%
made earlier that your average School
 
06:38:40.368 --> 06:38:40.378 align:start position:0%
Board member is not an educational
 
06:38:42.350 --> 06:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
expert curriculum instruction and
 
06:38:44.570 --> 06:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
assessment are typically left to to
 
06:38:46.610 --> 06:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
Educators to people that hire to have
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
higher degrees in this sort of thing I
 
06:38:50.868 --> 06:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
mean that's what nhsba recommends if it
 
06:38:52.128 --> 06:38:52.138 align:start position:0%
relates to education you know textbook
 
06:38:53.628 --> 06:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
approval yeah if the board wants to do
 
06:38:55.610 --> 06:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
that it can nothing prevent nothing in
 
06:38:57.590 --> 06:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
law prevents a school board from from
 
06:39:00.170 --> 06:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
adopting a policy or a directive that
 
06:39:03.048 --> 06:39:03.058 align:start position:0%
it's going to review curriculum select
 
06:39:06.410 --> 06:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
textbooks you know Vote or otherwise
 
06:39:08.690 --> 06:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
adopt the curricular standards the
 
06:39:10.190 --> 06:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
question is do school boards want to do
 
06:39:12.170 --> 06:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
that and do they have the expertise to
 
06:39:13.610 --> 06:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
do that some probably do and some
 
06:39:14.810 --> 06:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
probably don't
 
06:39:17.868 --> 06:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
so and I think you know I think I guess
 
06:39:20.390 --> 06:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
I would come back to I forget if it was
 
06:39:21.948 --> 06:39:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock or
 
06:39:23.690 --> 06:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative Porter and I think
 
06:39:25.490 --> 06:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman I talked about it
 
06:39:26.810 --> 06:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that have been
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
are is not because of the law being
 
06:39:32.868 --> 06:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
unclear it's because of the way
 
06:39:35.150 --> 06:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
individuals or a local school board has
 
06:39:35.160 --> 06:39:36.350 align:start position:0%
individuals or a local school board has
chosen

06:39:36.350 --> 06:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
06:39:38.330 --> 06:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
chosen to proceed and if that's the
 
06:39:41.208 --> 06:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
issue you know that that's a political
 
06:39:43.970 --> 06:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
issue that can be rectified at the you
 
06:39:47.628 --> 06:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
06:39:52.490 --> 06:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
first thank you for the in-depth answer
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
and I want you to know that I absolutely
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
heard every I did I heard everything
 
06:39:59.090 --> 06:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
that you were saying my question to you
 
06:40:01.250 --> 06:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
is um I heard what you were saying that
 
06:40:03.048 --> 06:40:03.058 align:start position:0%
you're feeling that not every bullet
 
06:40:05.570 --> 06:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
point in this bill maybe is appropriate
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to kick it back to you
 
06:40:09.530 --> 06:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
which may not be fair because I'm
 
06:40:11.090 --> 06:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
what would you support as the New
 
06:40:15.170 --> 06:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association with
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
this bill sure
 
06:40:16.798 --> 06:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
this bill sure
um

06:40:19.430 --> 06:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:21.048 --> 06:40:21.058 align:start position:0%
I'd want to give it a little bit more in
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
depth I'll follow up with you
 
06:40:24.410 --> 06:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative you know I'm looking at
 
06:40:27.470 --> 06:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know the paragraph three this is I
 
06:40:28.730 --> 06:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
guess page
 
06:40:31.910 --> 06:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
page one line 24 where it says elected
 
06:40:33.470 --> 06:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
School Board shell develop Implement and
 
06:40:35.330 --> 06:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
assess District policies conduct
 
06:40:37.070 --> 06:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and their right to no law I
 
06:40:38.810 --> 06:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
mean most of those those most of those
 
06:40:40.850 --> 06:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
Provisions are already in law so I
 
06:40:42.530 --> 06:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
suppose we support you know those
 
06:40:45.230 --> 06:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
aspects if you if you wanted to you know
 
06:40:47.570 --> 06:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
if you want to just reaffirm that the
 
06:40:49.910 --> 06:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
board you know I'd be careful with the
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
ethical Behavior standard because ethics
 
06:40:54.350 --> 06:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
one person's ethics is another person's
 
06:40:57.830 --> 06:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know male Behavior one person's good
 
06:40:59.410 --> 06:40:59.420 align:start position:0%
governance is another person's
 
06:41:02.150 --> 06:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
micromanaging so just be mindful with
 
06:41:04.430 --> 06:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
that but you know about reaffirming the
 
06:41:08.270 --> 06:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
right to no law proposing the the budget
 
06:41:10.128 --> 06:41:10.138 align:start position:0%
um be mindful with that some towns have
 
06:41:11.570 --> 06:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
budget Community Municipal budget
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
committees where the municipal budget
 
06:41:13.610 --> 06:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
committee is the one that actually
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
proposes the budget that goes to the
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
voters the local school board has a
 
06:41:18.350 --> 06:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to still develop a
 
06:41:20.690 --> 06:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and give it to the to
 
06:41:22.310 --> 06:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
the budget committee but in communities
 
06:41:24.048 --> 06:41:24.058 align:start position:0%
with the municipal budget committee it's
 
06:41:26.270 --> 06:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bud com that's bringing the budget
 
06:41:28.368 --> 06:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
to the voters
 
06:41:30.590 --> 06:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
um conduct annual performance reviews of
 
06:41:31.850 --> 06:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
the of the district superintendent
 
06:41:33.410 --> 06:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
that's already in law that's already
 
06:41:36.650 --> 06:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rule 3-0
 
06:41:36.660 --> 06:41:39.730 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rule 3-0
3.01

06:41:39.730 --> 06:41:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:43.190 --> 06:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
k l anyway it's in Department of
 
06:41:44.628 --> 06:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
Education rules and most boards have a
 
06:41:46.910 --> 06:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
policy that speak to that and as I'm
 
06:41:49.070 --> 06:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure most members of the members that
 
06:41:51.048 --> 06:41:51.058 align:start position:0%
have been on superintendents know that I
 
06:41:52.190 --> 06:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
haven't seen every superintendent
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
contract in the state but I know
 
06:41:55.010 --> 06:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
everyone I've ever seen has a provision
 
06:41:56.270 --> 06:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the contract that says you're going
 
06:41:58.250 --> 06:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the superintendent
 
06:42:00.410 --> 06:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
conduct contract negotiations I mean
 
06:42:02.208 --> 06:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
again that that's that's already a law
 
06:42:04.010 --> 06:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for public
 
06:42:06.288 --> 06:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
comments for board members
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
um some boards do that many boards some
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
many I don't know where that number is
 
06:42:11.628 --> 06:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
but we'll just have sort of an open
 
06:42:14.208 --> 06:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
board discussion where boards will you
 
06:42:15.288 --> 06:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
know board members just have an
 
06:42:17.930 --> 06:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to bring up new issues or
 
06:42:19.670 --> 06:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
ask for stuff to be put on the agenda or
 
06:42:21.350 --> 06:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
say oh this happened last night is there
 
06:42:23.570 --> 06:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
something we can look at it
 
06:42:27.170 --> 06:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
um you know the policies promoting
 
06:42:29.570 --> 06:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
parental engagement as I've said we we
 
06:42:31.430 --> 06:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
have sample policies on that already so
 
06:42:33.470 --> 06:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'd have any significant
 
06:42:35.990 --> 06:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
objection to that um the posting all the
 
06:42:38.810 --> 06:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
stuff on the on the website
 
06:42:40.850 --> 06:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's time and effort that school
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
districts do not have right now and it's
 
06:42:45.410 --> 06:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
as simple as that dude they don't have
 
06:42:47.510 --> 06:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
time we're trying to deal with the
 
06:42:48.770 --> 06:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
pandemic we're trying to deal with are
 
06:42:51.048 --> 06:42:51.058 align:start position:0%
we closing our schools or not I mean
 
06:42:52.850 --> 06:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's all public information anyway yes
 
06:42:55.670 --> 06:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
the more you know the more electronic
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
access we can provide people it's easy
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
is I so totally agree is easier just be
 
06:43:03.708 --> 06:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
mindful about what everything has to go
 
06:43:05.330 --> 06:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know put up on the website because
 
06:43:07.490 --> 06:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's somebody that's your I.T guy
 
06:43:09.530 --> 06:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
sitting there putting up every manifest
 
06:43:12.170 --> 06:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
and every Bill and every invoice and and
 
06:43:17.570 --> 06:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:20.030 --> 06:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
I could go on for hours about this if
 
06:43:21.430 --> 06:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
you haven't noticed
 
06:43:24.530 --> 06:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:43:27.470 --> 06:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again Barrett um
 
06:43:29.208 --> 06:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
it's caution us not to get down in the
 
06:43:31.368 --> 06:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
weeds too much on the state level I'm
 
06:43:32.510 --> 06:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
20 RSA 21 in colon one the first
 
06:43:39.708 --> 06:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
literature underneath the chapter of
 
06:43:41.448 --> 06:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
Education in the state
 
06:43:43.670 --> 06:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it reads the general court finds
 
06:43:46.490 --> 06:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
that the students parents General
 
06:43:46.500 --> 06:43:47.930 align:start position:0%
that the students parents General
citizenry

06:43:47.930 --> 06:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
06:43:50.690 --> 06:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
local school teachers and administrators
 
06:43:53.330 --> 06:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
local government local school boards
 
06:43:55.730 --> 06:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
school administrative units and state
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
government have a joint and share of
 
06:43:59.208 --> 06:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the quality of
 
06:43:59.218 --> 06:44:01.850 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the quality of
Education

06:44:01.850 --> 06:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:03.948 --> 06:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
all the ones that precede state
 
06:44:07.128 --> 06:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
government are local
 
06:44:09.948 --> 06:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
and so many of these issues need to be
 
06:44:09.958 --> 06:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
and so many of these issues need to be
resolved

06:44:11.390 --> 06:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
06:44:14.628 --> 06:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:17.570 --> 06:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
and I I can't say any more than that
 
06:44:19.190 --> 06:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
other than you know that's a
 
06:44:21.350 --> 06:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we all share
 
06:44:22.788 --> 06:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to work some of
 
06:44:25.190 --> 06:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
this out we believe in local control in
 
06:44:26.510 --> 06:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
this state
 
06:44:30.110 --> 06:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
walking to this level and saying State
 
06:44:32.690 --> 06:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
resolve it for us
 
06:44:35.690 --> 06:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
now we can agree that you know we're not
 
06:44:38.750 --> 06:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
maybe where we want to be but it's going
 
06:44:40.430 --> 06:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
to have to be resolved locally and I
 
06:44:41.690 --> 06:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
think Barrett's right
 
06:44:43.010 --> 06:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
if you don't like your school board
 
06:44:45.410 --> 06:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
members or get rid of them
 
06:44:47.810 --> 06:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
we got election coming up
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
or if you want some change work with
 
06:44:49.798 --> 06:44:50.628 align:start position:0%
or if you want some change work with
them

06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
or run for or run for school board or
 
06:44:55.490 --> 06:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
run for it yourself God bless you if you
 
06:44:55.500 --> 06:44:56.628 align:start position:0%
run for it yourself God bless you if you
do

06:44:56.628 --> 06:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
because it takes a lot of time
 
06:45:00.410 --> 06:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we need substitute
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
teachers too well I've got the
 
06:45:01.920 --> 06:45:03.350 align:start position:0%
teachers too well I've got the
microphone

06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
06:45:05.448 --> 06:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
and this thing's applicable to municipal
 
06:45:07.610 --> 06:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
government as well yeah you'd fit right
 
06:45:11.030 --> 06:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
in on that committee Mr chair
 
06:45:12.830 --> 06:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you very much again
 
06:45:15.070 --> 06:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
Barry thank you to everybody I
 
06:45:17.330 --> 06:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate you greatly appreciate it I
 
06:45:18.650 --> 06:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
would like to speak and I'd like to have
 
06:45:20.208 --> 06:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
everybody have the opportunity to do
 
06:45:20.218 --> 06:45:21.708 align:start position:0%
everybody have the opportunity to do
that

06:45:21.708 --> 06:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:24.850 --> 06:45:24.860 align:start position:0%
uh I I have a card here from a Tim
 
06:45:30.048 --> 06:45:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:32.810 --> 06:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
oh geleski okay
 
06:45:43.128 --> 06:45:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:45.770 --> 06:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
06:45:47.810 --> 06:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
06:45:49.910 --> 06:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
Tim galitski and I'm representing the
 
06:45:51.650 --> 06:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
school district governance Association
 
06:45:54.770 --> 06:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or sdga so the sdga
 
06:45:58.128 --> 06:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
supports HB 1137.
 
06:46:00.350 --> 06:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm a rep I'm a resident of
 
06:46:02.150 --> 06:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire where in the
 
06:46:04.610 --> 06:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
past I've served as the chairman of the
 
06:46:06.350 --> 06:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
school board and in my school board
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
service I always put in much effort to
 
06:46:11.448 --> 06:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
ensure that our board performed its
 
06:46:13.070 --> 06:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
educational duties
 
06:46:14.868 --> 06:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
this effort included refuting
 
06:46:16.968 --> 06:46:16.978 align:start position:0%
misinformation purporting that it is
 
06:46:19.730 --> 06:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
somehow inappropriate for a school board
 
06:46:21.770 --> 06:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
to set educational goals for its
 
06:46:21.780 --> 06:46:23.330 align:start position:0%
to set educational goals for its
District

06:46:23.330 --> 06:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
District
 
06:46:25.368 --> 06:46:25.378 align:start position:0%
of course the truth is that it's the
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
affirmative Duty of any school board to
 
06:46:30.410 --> 06:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
set educational goals for its district
 
06:46:33.708 --> 06:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on them
 
06:46:36.048 --> 06:46:36.058 align:start position:0%
and all this is these facts are set
 
06:46:39.530 --> 06:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
forth in administrative rule at 303.01 G
 
06:46:42.288 --> 06:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
which names six specific duties that
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
each School Board shall perform
 
06:46:47.810 --> 06:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
so the sdga following up on on
 
06:46:50.448 --> 06:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
experiences like this and others studied
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
the performance of these six educational
 
06:46:55.250 --> 06:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
duties by the Exeter region Cooperative
 
06:46:57.830 --> 06:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
District or School Board Laconia and
 
06:46:59.868 --> 06:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
Timberlane school boards over several
 
06:47:03.048 --> 06:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
school years starting with the 2018-2019
 
06:47:04.730 --> 06:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
school year
 
06:47:07.190 --> 06:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
so the details of this study are in the
 
06:47:08.750 --> 06:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll I'll leave
 
06:47:10.310 --> 06:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
06:47:11.990 --> 06:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share with you our findings
 
06:47:15.948 --> 06:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
and our reasons for supporting HB 1137
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
So based on the governmental records
 
06:47:19.610 --> 06:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
that we were able to obtain and identify
 
06:47:22.250 --> 06:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
we made three findings
 
06:47:24.770 --> 06:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
the first finding is that none of the
 
06:47:26.628 --> 06:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
examined school boards fully performed
 
06:47:28.670 --> 06:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
its educational duties required by rule
 
06:47:28.680 --> 06:47:29.530 align:start position:0%
its educational duties required by rule
Ed

06:47:29.530 --> 06:47:29.540 align:start position:0%
Ed
 
06:47:32.330 --> 06:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
303.01 G
 
06:47:34.610 --> 06:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
the second finding is that there were
 
06:47:36.788 --> 06:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
some patterns in the performance of Ed
 
06:47:38.930 --> 06:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
303.01g duties
 
06:47:40.968 --> 06:47:40.978 align:start position:0%
specifically school boards in general
 
06:47:44.208 --> 06:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
they determined educational goals
 
06:47:46.910 --> 06:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
they determined long-range plans and
 
06:47:48.590 --> 06:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
they identified short-term objectives
 
06:47:50.690 --> 06:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
though there were some some lapses in
 
06:47:52.250 --> 06:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
these duties
 
06:47:55.610 --> 06:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
however in no case was the sdga able to
 
06:47:57.530 --> 06:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
identify records showing that the school
 
06:48:00.288 --> 06:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
board and the school board itself
 
06:48:02.990 --> 06:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
had performed its duties to require the
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
implementation of educational programs
 
06:48:06.590 --> 06:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
designed to reflect District the
 
06:48:08.690 --> 06:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
district's goals and objectives to
 
06:48:10.850 --> 06:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
review such programs or to make public
 
06:48:14.690 --> 06:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
the results of such investigation
 
06:48:16.910 --> 06:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
the third finding is that in some cases
 
06:48:18.708 --> 06:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
these duties were performed by the
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit and not by
 
06:48:23.510 --> 06:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
The District School Board Itself by its
 
06:48:23.520 --> 06:48:25.730 align:start position:0%
The District School Board Itself by its
own actions

06:48:25.730 --> 06:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
own actions
 
06:48:28.670 --> 06:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the sdga supports HP 1137 because it
 
06:48:30.048 --> 06:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
would improve the performance of school
 
06:48:31.670 --> 06:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
board's educational duties in the
 
06:48:33.288 --> 06:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
following ways
 
06:48:35.208 --> 06:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
first it would make the educational
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
duties of school boards more specific
 
06:48:40.548 --> 06:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
it would make these statutory duties of
 
06:48:42.350 --> 06:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
school boards more specific and thereby
 
06:48:44.628 --> 06:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
make these duties more clear to all
 
06:48:46.430 --> 06:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore more likely to be
 
06:48:46.440 --> 06:48:48.350 align:start position:0%
and therefore more likely to be
performed

06:48:48.350 --> 06:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
performed
 
06:48:50.330 --> 06:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
second it would shift the oversight of
 
06:48:52.310 --> 06:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
Education away from the unelected
 
06:48:54.590 --> 06:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
administrators and toward the elected
 
06:48:58.190 --> 06:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
school boards where it belongs
 
06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
and third HB 1137's promotion of
 
06:49:02.570 --> 06:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
Parental engagement and school
 
06:49:04.670 --> 06:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
transparency as well as the requirement
 
06:49:06.350 --> 06:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
of annual parental surveys would make
 
06:49:08.090 --> 06:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
the educational work of school boards
 
06:49:10.368 --> 06:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
more responsive to families and the
 
06:49:10.378 --> 06:49:11.090 align:start position:0%
more responsive to families and the
public

06:49:11.090 --> 06:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:49:12.708 --> 06:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons the school
 
06:49:15.530 --> 06:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
district governance Association asks you
 
06:49:17.750 --> 06:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully to vote that this ought to
 
06:49:17.760 --> 06:49:18.708 align:start position:0%
respectfully to vote that this ought to
pass

06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:49:21.468 --> 06:49:21.478 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I'd be happy to try to
 
06:49:22.968 --> 06:49:22.978 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that there might be
 
06:49:25.850 --> 06:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Waltz
 
06:49:30.110 --> 06:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
I just have a quick question about your
 
06:49:32.930 --> 06:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
organization are you a 501c3 because I
 
06:49:34.490 --> 06:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
was looking for your 990s and I couldn't
 
06:49:36.110 --> 06:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
find anything on file
 
06:49:38.930 --> 06:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure but I don't believe it is
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
a 501c3 it's a non-profit Association in
 
06:49:45.650 --> 06:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I either a 501c3 or four I
 
06:49:48.530 --> 06:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
would presume I don't know the exact IRS
 
06:49:50.690 --> 06:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
tax status of the organization
 
06:49:52.670 --> 06:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:49:55.090 --> 06:49:55.100 align:start position:0%
for the further questions
 
06:49:58.490 --> 06:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming today
 
06:50:00.530 --> 06:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
06:50:04.490 --> 06:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
invite forth Ken uring
 
06:50:19.690 --> 06:50:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:28.010 --> 06:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:30.770 --> 06:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for allowing me
 
06:50:32.810 --> 06:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
to speak and honorable representatives
 
06:50:34.968 --> 06:50:34.978 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to take some of your
 
06:50:36.890 --> 06:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
valuable time I also want to thank
 
06:50:39.110 --> 06:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
repcor Deli and all the sponsors of this
 
06:50:41.330 --> 06:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
bill I believe that this is a very
 
06:50:43.070 --> 06:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
important bill and I support this and I
 
06:50:44.990 --> 06:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass it
 
06:50:47.448 --> 06:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
I am a current
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
former chairman I'm not current I'm a
 
06:50:52.128 --> 06:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
former chairman of the Windham School
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
Board so I'm speaking from experience
 
06:50:56.810 --> 06:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I ran is because
 
06:50:59.570 --> 06:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
our school board was not responsive to
 
06:50:59.580 --> 06:51:00.650 align:start position:0%
our school board was not responsive to
parents

06:51:00.650 --> 06:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:51:02.690 --> 06:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
they did not allow them to speak during
 
06:51:04.128 --> 06:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
06:51:06.530 --> 06:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a travesty because
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
06:51:10.070 --> 06:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
says that we the people or the
 
06:51:10.080 --> 06:51:11.628 align:start position:0%
says that we the people or the
government

06:51:11.628 --> 06:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:51:15.410 --> 06:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
and when school board members were sworn
 
06:51:17.090 --> 06:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
into office they take an oath to that
 
06:51:17.100 --> 06:51:18.590 align:start position:0%
into office they take an oath to that
Constitution

06:51:18.590 --> 06:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:51:21.410 --> 06:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
article 8 says that all power resides in
 
06:51:22.490 --> 06:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the people
 
06:51:26.030 --> 06:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
and that our officers and magistries are
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
our substitutes and at all times
 
06:51:29.690 --> 06:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
accountable to us
 
06:51:31.670 --> 06:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
and when that doesn't happen there needs
 
06:51:33.830 --> 06:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be consequences
 
06:51:36.468 --> 06:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about just a few
 
06:51:36.478 --> 06:51:37.610 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about just a few
things

06:51:37.610 --> 06:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
parents know what's best for their kids
 
06:51:41.690 --> 06:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
the schools are there to educate their
 
06:51:44.150 --> 06:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
kids and when these school boards are
 
06:51:46.010 --> 06:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
implementing policies and curriculums
 
06:51:47.868 --> 06:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
that go against their values and their
 
06:51:49.730 --> 06:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
principles that they should have a right
 
06:51:52.670 --> 06:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
to express that and school boards Across
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
the Nation are shutting parents down and
 
06:51:56.690 --> 06:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's wrong because we are the
 
06:51:59.390 --> 06:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
government they work for us and I say
 
06:52:01.548 --> 06:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
that with respect but that's the deal
 
06:52:03.948 --> 06:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
that's the arrangement and they swear an
 
06:52:05.810 --> 06:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
oath to that arrangement
 
06:52:08.990 --> 06:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
so I agree that um
 
06:52:10.788 --> 06:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
that all the information should go
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
online we did that when I was chairman
 
06:52:16.070 --> 06:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal don't believe what
 
06:52:17.330 --> 06:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
you're being told
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
it may takes a little bit of extra time
 
06:52:21.410 --> 06:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
but this is part of accountability we're
 
06:52:23.208 --> 06:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
talking about tens of millions of
 
06:52:25.250 --> 06:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
dollars and sometimes over 100 million
 
06:52:27.708 --> 06:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on the school district
 
06:52:29.628 --> 06:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and parents have a right to
 
06:52:32.448 --> 06:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
know how their money is being spent
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
they also know how their money is being
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
implemented in the classroom putting the
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
names of the textbooks and the reading
 
06:52:43.250 --> 06:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
materials lists and the instructional
 
06:52:46.070 --> 06:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
materials in the curriculum online is
 
06:52:49.010 --> 06:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary for parents to
 
06:52:51.530 --> 06:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
realize what's going on in the classroom
 
06:52:54.410 --> 06:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
when I was chairman I had parents come
 
06:52:58.490 --> 06:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
to me and complain about two teachers
 
06:53:01.190 --> 06:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
it was regarding
 
06:53:04.070 --> 06:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
um what was taught on Constitution Day
 
06:53:06.110 --> 06:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
September 17th
 
06:53:08.810 --> 06:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
by federal law schools have to teach
 
06:53:11.030 --> 06:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution
 
06:53:12.530 --> 06:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
now Mr
 
06:53:12.540 --> 06:53:13.910 align:start position:0%
now Mr
Christina

06:53:13.910 --> 06:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
06:53:15.708 --> 06:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
said that we don't want to micromanage
 
06:53:16.910 --> 06:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
the teachers
 
06:53:18.830 --> 06:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
well you need to provide some guidance
 
06:53:20.448 --> 06:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
as to what's being taught
 
06:53:22.730 --> 06:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's not just teaching the Constitution
 
06:53:24.830 --> 06:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
but it's teaching that it's a great
 
06:53:27.230 --> 06:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
document as the founding document of our
 
06:53:29.930 --> 06:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
of our government and it's and it's
 
06:53:31.788 --> 06:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
teaching it in a positive way
 
06:53:33.890 --> 06:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
one teacher said that
 
06:53:36.110 --> 06:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to teach you
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
that today's a day to celebrate the
 
06:53:38.160 --> 06:53:40.010 align:start position:0%
that today's a day to celebrate the
Constitution

06:53:40.010 --> 06:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:53:41.990 --> 06:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
and his follow-up was but there's
 
06:53:44.448 --> 06:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
nothing to celebrate about it
 
06:53:46.968 --> 06:53:46.978 align:start position:0%
that was taught to our children in 12th
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
grade that's unacceptable
 
06:53:53.208 --> 06:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
another teacher in high school said I'm
 
06:53:54.770 --> 06:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
going to take five minutes to talk about
 
06:53:56.690 --> 06:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
the Constitution because I was told I
 
06:53:57.708 --> 06:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:53:59.628 --> 06:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
that's disgusting
 
06:54:01.788 --> 06:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
so you know when you say you don't want
 
06:54:04.430 --> 06:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
to micromanage people I understand that
 
06:54:05.690 --> 06:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
you don't want to tell them every word
 
06:54:07.490 --> 06:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
that they're going to relay but you have
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
to tell them the message that has to be
 
06:54:11.868 --> 06:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
conveyed and then let them do that in
 
06:54:13.190 --> 06:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
their own way
 
06:54:14.990 --> 06:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
06:54:17.750 --> 06:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about some of the
 
06:54:19.490 --> 06:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
things that Mr Christina said he talked
 
06:54:21.530 --> 06:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
about some policies and a lot of the
 
06:54:24.170 --> 06:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
policies are good they uh it's a it's a
 
06:54:25.788 --> 06:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
pain in the neck to write policies I was
 
06:54:27.288 --> 06:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
on the policy committee for three years
 
06:54:29.930 --> 06:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
and every word means something but they
 
06:54:32.150 --> 06:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
also have policies or they recommended a
 
06:54:35.150 --> 06:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
policy jbab that mandated employees
 
06:54:36.708 --> 06:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
withhold information about their
 
06:54:39.948 --> 06:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
children that's unacceptable
 
06:54:42.230 --> 06:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely unacceptable and there were
 
06:54:44.570 --> 06:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
violations to the and if employees
 
06:54:47.390 --> 06:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
violated that policy they would be held
 
06:54:47.400 --> 06:54:48.530 align:start position:0%
violated that policy they would be held
accountable

06:54:48.530 --> 06:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
he said multiple times that the solution
 
06:54:53.390 --> 06:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
to this is just vote out to people well
 
06:54:54.830 --> 06:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
some of these terms are for four years
 
06:54:56.750 --> 06:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you don't realize who you just voted
 
06:54:58.670 --> 06:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
in until maybe a week or two after
 
06:55:00.170 --> 06:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
they're in office now you're supposed to
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
wait four years when they take office
 
06:55:04.628 --> 06:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
they swear an oath to the Constitution
 
06:55:07.968 --> 06:55:07.978 align:start position:0%
Article 8 as I said before
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
means that they will be accountable to
 
06:55:12.530 --> 06:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
the people and the and the alternative
 
06:55:15.530 --> 06:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
to that is or or state law 40 call in
 
06:55:18.350 --> 06:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
one says it vile that's the oath that
 
06:55:20.990 --> 06:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
they must take and and the solution to
 
06:55:22.788 --> 06:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
that is that they shall be forthrift to
 
06:55:25.010 --> 06:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
remove from office
 
06:55:27.230 --> 06:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
right but that costs money that takes
 
06:55:29.030 --> 06:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
time and it takes the right judge to do
 
06:55:31.128 --> 06:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
that and they're getting legal advice
 
06:55:34.368 --> 06:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
from organizations like the nhsba like
 
06:55:37.368 --> 06:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
the nhsaa like their legal counsel to
 
06:55:38.868 --> 06:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
tell them they can do what they're doing
 
06:55:40.128 --> 06:55:40.138 align:start position:0%
and that gives them plausible
 
06:55:42.048 --> 06:55:42.058 align:start position:0%
deniability so if you try to take them
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
to court and have them removed from
 
06:55:45.590 --> 06:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
office they're going to say your honor I
 
06:55:47.150 --> 06:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
was just following the advice I was
 
06:55:47.160 --> 06:55:48.170 align:start position:0%
was just following the advice I was
given

06:55:48.170 --> 06:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
given
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable too we have to have
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
a way to hold our school board members
 
06:55:55.010 --> 06:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
accountable it's it's part of the
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
process of our constitutional republic
 
06:56:00.948 --> 06:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
so I agree with the uh with the public
 
06:56:03.410 --> 06:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
engagement when I was chairman prior to
 
06:56:05.570 --> 06:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
me becoming chairman there was
 
06:56:07.310 --> 06:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
three-minute limitation for parents to
 
06:56:09.530 --> 06:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
come up and talk when I became chairman
 
06:56:11.628 --> 06:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
people could come up and talk I did not
 
06:56:13.548 --> 06:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
put a three-minute time limit on it I
 
06:56:16.010 --> 06:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
allowed them to talk on every agenda
 
06:56:18.230 --> 06:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
item because we are there to serve them
 
06:56:19.730 --> 06:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's their children that are being
 
06:56:19.740 --> 06:56:20.930 align:start position:0%
it's their children that are being
educated

06:56:20.930 --> 06:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
educated
 
06:56:22.968 --> 06:56:22.978 align:start position:0%
that has to be kept in the front of
 
06:56:25.190 --> 06:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's mind
 
06:56:27.650 --> 06:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking about children being
 
06:56:30.468 --> 06:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
educated and parents having as you said
 
06:56:33.468 --> 06:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd parents being a
 
06:56:36.830 --> 06:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:36.840 --> 06:56:40.968 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

06:56:40.968 --> 06:56:40.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:40.978 --> 06:56:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
now

06:56:42.410 --> 06:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:56:44.510 --> 06:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Christina also said that these
 
06:56:46.610 --> 06:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
meetings can if you allow people to talk
 
06:56:48.350 --> 06:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
and you got to remember these are the
 
06:56:50.090 --> 06:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
people paying okay these are the
 
06:56:52.490 --> 06:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
shareholders these are their children if
 
06:56:54.048 --> 06:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
you allow people to talk on all the
 
06:56:55.910 --> 06:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
agenda items meetings can go to midnight
 
06:56:58.750 --> 06:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
well you know what these boards meet
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
twice twice a month usually have more
 
06:57:04.730 --> 06:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
meetings we're running a multi-million
 
06:57:07.010 --> 06:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
dollar business to educate children
 
06:57:09.468 --> 06:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
that's how it has to be looked at if you
 
06:57:11.330 --> 06:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time in the two
 
06:57:14.090 --> 06:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
meetings that you meet every month then
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
schedule meeting as often as you need to
 
06:57:18.770 --> 06:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
allow the shareholders to have their say
 
06:57:20.390 --> 06:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
into how their children are being
 
06:57:22.788 --> 06:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
educated that is of the utmost
 
06:57:24.708 --> 06:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
importance and that's what's being
 
06:57:26.628 --> 06:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
ignored and they're getting support from
 
06:57:30.350 --> 06:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
organizations like the nhb nhsba and the
 
06:57:33.708 --> 06:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
nhba who as you all know
 
06:57:35.690 --> 06:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know coerced with the federal
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
government to have them defined as
 
06:57:41.030 --> 06:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorists in America who would
 
06:57:43.070 --> 06:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
have believed that that type of language
 
06:57:45.110 --> 06:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
that our federal government would be
 
06:57:47.570 --> 06:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
weaponized against parents going to
 
06:57:49.250 --> 06:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
school board meetings because they're
 
06:57:52.310 --> 06:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
frustrated about Mass policies
 
06:57:55.070 --> 06:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
whatever side you stand on is fine you
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
should have a right to express your
 
06:57:59.810 --> 06:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
opinions and how your children should be
 
06:58:02.208 --> 06:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
handled in school and the fact that
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
you've got Mr Christina up here and
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
you've got some other people whoever
 
06:58:07.270 --> 06:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
they're learning about the language
 
06:58:10.250 --> 06:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
point of water please
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
I like the question through you we have
 
06:58:14.150 --> 06:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
this generally has the right to speak to
 
06:58:15.468 --> 06:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
the bill multiple times I have no
 
06:58:16.730 --> 06:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
problem with that be happy to listen to
 
06:58:18.830 --> 06:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
them and learning things but I do object
 
06:58:20.690 --> 06:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
them continually referring to Mr Katina
 
06:58:22.670 --> 06:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
in his testimony we can't do it here we
 
06:58:23.868 --> 06:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
can't refer to another representative
 
06:58:25.430 --> 06:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
he's not discussing the bill he's
 
06:58:27.170 --> 06:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
discussing the representative already
 
06:58:28.850 --> 06:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
spoke with the person who spoke I
 
06:58:31.548 --> 06:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'd like to clarify one
 
06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
one point here that the New Hampshire
 
06:58:37.868 --> 06:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
school boards Association
 
06:58:41.090 --> 06:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
withdrew from the national as a result
 
06:58:43.448 --> 06:58:43.458 align:start position:0%
of that acrimony on the national level
 
06:58:46.730 --> 06:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
so our association we should be saying
 
06:58:48.048 --> 06:58:48.058 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:51.048 --> 06:58:51.058 align:start position:0%
in that regard they recognized that what
 
06:58:52.490 --> 06:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
was stated
 
06:58:55.968 --> 06:58:55.978 align:start position:0%
was on the national level was not where
 
06:58:59.330 --> 06:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
they are policy wise or believing in
 
06:59:02.570 --> 06:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
so and yes can we just please try to I
 
06:59:03.948 --> 06:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to limit you from speaking
 
06:59:06.590 --> 06:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine I have another big one right
 
06:59:09.288 --> 06:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
after this as well okay
 
06:59:12.350 --> 06:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
um but prior to that domestic terrorist
 
06:59:14.448 --> 06:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
statement they were aligned with all of
 
06:59:17.390 --> 06:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
the policies and all of the and all of
 
06:59:20.150 --> 06:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
the direction that was given to our
 
06:59:22.910 --> 06:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
school board members and
 
06:59:25.490 --> 06:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
and that's where CRT policies came from
 
06:59:27.708 --> 06:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
that's where many other policies their
 
06:59:28.968 --> 06:59:28.978 align:start position:0%
parents are
 
06:59:32.390 --> 06:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
objecting to came from so let's not just
 
06:59:34.490 --> 06:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
sever it and say that there that that
 
06:59:36.770 --> 06:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
everything's good and hunky dory and
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
Rosie there are things that came prior
 
06:59:41.208 --> 06:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
to that one-term domestic terrorist that
 
06:59:44.150 --> 06:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
parents want to have a voice in and I
 
06:59:46.730 --> 06:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that in the 1964
 
06:59:48.410 --> 06:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling New York Times
 
06:59:50.030 --> 06:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
versus Sullivan and this is about
 
06:59:50.040 --> 06:59:51.770 align:start position:0%
versus Sullivan and this is about
sometimes

06:59:51.770 --> 06:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
06:59:55.250 --> 06:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
the adversarial language that people use
 
06:59:57.890 --> 06:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
I don't like using the words Nazis or
 
06:59:59.930 --> 06:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
calling people Communists but they have
 
07:00:01.910 --> 07:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
a First Amendment right to do that and
 
07:00:05.090 --> 07:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
the 1964 Supreme Court ruling upholds
 
07:00:07.610 --> 07:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
that it said the court emphasized the
 
07:00:09.230 --> 07:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
importance of allowing citizens to
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
criticize the government side in quote a
 
07:00:13.128 --> 07:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
profound National commitment to the
 
07:00:14.930 --> 07:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
principle that debate on public issues
 
07:00:17.510 --> 07:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be uninhibited robust and wide
 
07:00:19.490 --> 07:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
open and that it may well include
 
07:00:21.410 --> 07:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
vehement caustic and sometimes
 
07:00:23.690 --> 07:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
unpleasantly sharp attacks on government
 
07:00:26.750 --> 07:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
and public officials unquote that's
 
07:00:29.570 --> 07:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
constitutional state law so I believe
 
07:00:31.250 --> 07:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
that you should always be respectful I
 
07:00:32.330 --> 07:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
should believe that you should always
 
07:00:34.368 --> 07:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
have an open dialogue but the problem is
 
07:00:37.010 --> 07:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
is that our school boards are not
 
07:00:38.750 --> 07:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
allowing open dialogue people getting
 
07:00:41.570 --> 07:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
upset people are spending a lot of money
 
07:00:45.190 --> 07:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
through their taxes 70 to 75 if not more
 
07:00:49.368 --> 07:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
of home tax real estate taxes goes to
 
07:00:53.150 --> 07:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
your schools that's a lot of money and
 
07:00:55.010 --> 07:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
when people don't have the right to
 
07:00:57.548 --> 07:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
represent their children
 
07:01:00.410 --> 07:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
their children who they know what's best
 
07:01:00.420 --> 07:01:01.190 align:start position:0%
their children who they know what's best
for

07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:01:04.610 --> 07:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
the frustration levels are easy to grow
 
07:01:07.310 --> 07:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I think I got in most of my points I
 
07:01:09.590 --> 07:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful of your time
 
07:01:11.930 --> 07:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say that one of the
 
07:01:13.968 --> 07:01:13.978 align:start position:0%
things that I'd like to see added to
 
07:01:17.330 --> 07:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
this bill and you know or our penalties
 
07:01:19.010 --> 07:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
for when people
 
07:01:22.128 --> 07:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
don't follow the law you know there's a
 
07:01:24.288 --> 07:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
lot of times where the law is skirted
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then it's a slap on the wrist and
 
07:01:29.030 --> 07:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
then nothing's really done about it so
 
07:01:29.040 --> 07:01:31.968 align:start position:0%
then nothing's really done about it so
um

07:01:31.968 --> 07:01:31.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:34.010 --> 07:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I think with that you know I think I
 
07:01:35.330 --> 07:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
got most of my points and I want to
 
07:01:36.890 --> 07:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me and and I
 
07:01:39.830 --> 07:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
hope that you support this bill it's not
 
07:01:41.868 --> 07:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's not rocket science it's not
 
07:01:44.750 --> 07:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
earth-shattering these we implemented
 
07:01:46.368 --> 07:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
most of the things when I was chairman
 
07:01:48.048 --> 07:01:48.058 align:start position:0%
it's not disruptive to the school
 
07:01:50.570 --> 07:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
district at all
 
07:01:53.030 --> 07:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:01:55.070 --> 07:01:55.080 align:start position:0%

07:01:56.570 --> 07:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
not seen any from the committee thank
 
07:01:57.968 --> 07:01:57.978 align:start position:0%

director

07:02:33.830 --> 07:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:37.070 --> 07:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
should I just go ahead yes please so for
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Maura Ryan I'm a
 
07:02:40.490 --> 07:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
parent and a New Hampshire constituent
 
07:02:45.170 --> 07:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to support HB 1137
 
07:02:45.180 --> 07:02:46.190 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to support HB 1137
um

07:02:46.190 --> 07:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:48.170 --> 07:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's been there's evidence-based
 
07:02:50.150 --> 07:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
research per Harvard University that
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
shows that school districts with high
 
07:02:53.330 --> 07:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
parent engagement rate have better
 
07:02:55.190 --> 07:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes than any other school districts
 
07:02:56.868 --> 07:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
parent engagement and parent
 
07:02:59.448 --> 07:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
participation is a critical key to the
 
07:03:02.570 --> 07:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
success of Any Given School District
 
07:03:02.580 --> 07:03:03.288 align:start position:0%
success of Any Given School District
um

07:03:03.288 --> 07:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:05.690 --> 07:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
the relationship between parents and
 
07:03:07.368 --> 07:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
school districts has become adversarial
 
07:03:09.110 --> 07:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
as of late
 
07:03:10.968 --> 07:03:10.978 align:start position:0%
um there were several instances in our
 
07:03:12.170 --> 07:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
school board meeting which I go to
 
07:03:13.730 --> 07:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
fairly regularly because I'm a very
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
involved parent where public comment was
 
07:03:18.650 --> 07:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
eliminated or left to the end and
 
07:03:20.270 --> 07:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
parents who wanted to comment on voting
 
07:03:22.368 --> 07:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
items were not able to do so until the
 
07:03:24.948 --> 07:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
vote was taken afterwards there were
 
07:03:26.330 --> 07:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
parents who were disparaging other
 
07:03:29.628 --> 07:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
parents and um you know the police were
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
involved and I think when The Police
 
07:03:32.330 --> 07:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
become involved then it's even more
 
07:03:32.340 --> 07:03:34.090 align:start position:0%
become involved then it's even more
escalated

07:03:34.090 --> 07:03:34.100 align:start position:0%
escalated
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that I think with the
 
07:03:40.610 --> 07:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
school board and the school district are
 
07:03:42.410 --> 07:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
that it's very difficult right now to
 
07:03:44.208 --> 07:03:44.218 align:start position:0%
delineate between the school board and
 
07:03:45.770 --> 07:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
the school board and the school district
 
07:03:48.230 --> 07:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
our school board is represented by our
 
07:03:50.448 --> 07:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
school district attorney which in my
 
07:03:52.310 --> 07:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
opinion is a huge conflict of interest
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
because the school district Mr chair
 
07:04:00.590 --> 07:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:02.868 --> 07:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
I believe so keeping it to the as
 
07:04:04.730 --> 07:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
opposed to conflicts with the school
 
07:04:04.740 --> 07:04:05.628 align:start position:0%
opposed to conflicts with the school
district

07:04:05.628 --> 07:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
district
 
07:04:07.968 --> 07:04:07.978 align:start position:0%
attorney I believe that this bill
 
07:04:10.310 --> 07:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
delineates some of the responsibilities
 
07:04:13.128 --> 07:04:13.138 align:start position:0%
that those that line is not as fuzzy
 
07:04:15.230 --> 07:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I would say
 
07:04:16.788 --> 07:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
okay please continue
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um keep it to those points sure
 
07:04:19.680 --> 07:04:22.910 align:start position:0%
um keep it to those points sure
um

07:04:22.910 --> 07:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:25.690 --> 07:04:25.700 align:start position:0%
right now with our schools we have a
 
07:04:28.070 --> 07:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
self-policing model which is not
 
07:04:29.330 --> 07:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it doesn't work
 
07:04:31.910 --> 07:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
James Madison recognized that over 200
 
07:04:32.990 --> 07:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
years ago is when he wrote The
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
Federalist Papers
 
07:04:36.770 --> 07:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
um and the school boards have the same
 
07:04:39.410 --> 07:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
model so it doesn't work because when
 
07:04:40.730 --> 07:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
parents go to the school board to bring
 
07:04:42.110 --> 07:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
up issues and these are legitimate
 
07:04:43.850 --> 07:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
issues we've brought up issues about the
 
07:04:46.368 --> 07:04:46.378 align:start position:0%
math curriculum several times they don't
 
07:04:48.670 --> 07:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
want to discuss them or address them
 
07:04:50.930 --> 07:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
many parents aren't able to come to
 
07:04:52.190 --> 07:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
school board meetings because of work
 
07:04:54.048 --> 07:04:54.058 align:start position:0%
and yes virtual has made that easier and
 
07:04:55.368 --> 07:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
they can't come here because they're
 
07:04:58.010 --> 07:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
working many parents feel that their
 
07:05:00.948 --> 07:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
voices are discounted many parents today
 
07:05:02.510 --> 07:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
because of our New Hampshire school
 
07:05:04.610 --> 07:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
system have college degrees and advanced
 
07:05:07.548 --> 07:05:07.558 align:start position:0%
degrees I personally have four Advanced
 
07:05:10.730 --> 07:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
degrees and you know when I go before
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
the school board they treat me like I'm
 
07:05:14.930 --> 07:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
I work at McDonald's and I don't think
 
07:05:16.968 --> 07:05:16.978 align:start position:0%
that that's respectful and I think that
 
07:05:18.410 --> 07:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
other parents don't perceive that as
 
07:05:18.420 --> 07:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
other parents don't perceive that as
respectful

07:05:19.910 --> 07:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
respectful
 
07:05:19.920 --> 07:05:21.048 align:start position:0%
respectful
um

07:05:21.048 --> 07:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:23.628 --> 07:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
school districts don't need
 
07:05:26.330 --> 07:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
the school boards need to to make sure
 
07:05:28.490 --> 07:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
that the school district is performing
 
07:05:30.770 --> 07:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
appropriately and in line and I think
 
07:05:32.448 --> 07:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
that this bill sort of
 
07:05:36.350 --> 07:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
puts in codification what they need to
 
07:05:38.270 --> 07:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
do and a lot of school board members
 
07:05:40.190 --> 07:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what they need to do they're
 
07:05:41.690 --> 07:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
Flying Blind when they come into the
 
07:05:41.700 --> 07:05:43.070 align:start position:0%
Flying Blind when they come into the
role

07:05:43.070 --> 07:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
role
 
07:05:43.080 --> 07:05:46.190 align:start position:0%
role
um

07:05:46.190 --> 07:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:47.810 --> 07:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
some of the wealthier school districts
 
07:05:50.270 --> 07:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
too you know people say that there are
 
07:05:52.670 --> 07:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
issues with that but that's more related
 
07:05:56.150 --> 07:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
to their individual Geographic areas as
 
07:05:56.160 --> 07:05:57.530 align:start position:0%
to their individual Geographic areas as
for

07:05:57.530 --> 07:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:05:59.150 --> 07:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
parents being allowed to observe in
 
07:06:01.368 --> 07:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
classrooms that's already in federal law
 
07:06:05.570 --> 07:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
under Essa section 8101 and section 1116
 
07:06:07.910 --> 07:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
they should be given that opportunity
 
07:06:10.850 --> 07:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
already and federal law does not is not
 
07:06:13.850 --> 07:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
trumped by School District policy that
 
07:06:15.850 --> 07:06:15.860 align:start position:0%
is kind of a ridiculous argument
 
07:06:18.368 --> 07:06:18.378 align:start position:0%
parents have been marginalized in school
 
07:06:21.468 --> 07:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
participation to fundraising which is
 
07:06:22.730 --> 07:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
not appropriate because that doesn't
 
07:06:24.530 --> 07:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
help the school get better they have
 
07:06:26.350 --> 07:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
many different voices which should help
 
07:06:29.030 --> 07:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
diversify what the school is doing to
 
07:06:30.468 --> 07:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
improve it
 
07:06:32.330 --> 07:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
um excuse me could you please keep to
 
07:06:34.730 --> 07:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
the bill which is what the school board
 
07:06:39.590 --> 07:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:43.128 --> 07:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
your problems okay well I know some
 
07:06:44.570 --> 07:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
school districts are holding meetings at
 
07:06:46.128 --> 07:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
unreasonable hours for example the
 
07:06:48.650 --> 07:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
curriculum committee is held at 6 30 a.m
 
07:06:50.448 --> 07:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's reasonable to ask a
 
07:06:51.650 --> 07:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
parent to come to a curriculum meeting
 
07:06:53.868 --> 07:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
at 6 30 a.m I think a lot of times
 
07:06:55.610 --> 07:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
parents come to school boards after
 
07:06:57.350 --> 07:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
they've exhausted the chain of command
 
07:06:59.090 --> 07:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
they've gone to the teacher they've gone
 
07:07:00.530 --> 07:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
to the principal they've gone to the
 
07:07:02.448 --> 07:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the superintendent
 
07:07:05.030 --> 07:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
will often not get involved because he's
 
07:07:06.590 --> 07:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
advised not to in the event that there's
 
07:07:08.510 --> 07:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
an investigation so they then go to the
 
07:07:09.590 --> 07:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
school board and when they don't get
 
07:07:13.070 --> 07:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
resolution there it just increases their
 
07:07:15.468 --> 07:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
level of
 
07:07:15.478 --> 07:07:17.868 align:start position:0%
level of
frustration

07:07:17.868 --> 07:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
07:07:19.788 --> 07:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
um and I think if we lay out exactly
 
07:07:21.048 --> 07:07:21.058 align:start position:0%
what a school board is supposed to do
 
07:07:22.850 --> 07:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
where a parent can look it up easily and
 
07:07:25.310 --> 07:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
understand it because parents don't know
 
07:07:26.990 --> 07:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
these laws parents have been looking for
 
07:07:28.730 --> 07:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
these laws there are parents who have
 
07:07:30.708 --> 07:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know we had two school board members
 
07:07:33.770 --> 07:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
appointed by other board members and
 
07:07:35.628 --> 07:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
these parents want to recall those board
 
07:07:37.330 --> 07:07:37.340 align:start position:0%
members and there's nothing in the law
 
07:07:41.150 --> 07:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
so if we made the law clear I think it
 
07:07:43.490 --> 07:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial for parents for the
 
07:07:49.070 --> 07:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:50.750 --> 07:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'd like to say I
 
07:07:52.670 --> 07:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
support this bill I think that it's
 
07:07:54.170 --> 07:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
easier for parents to understand it if
 
07:07:55.788 --> 07:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
it's in black and white it's easier for
 
07:07:57.110 --> 07:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
school board members because they're not
 
07:07:58.910 --> 07:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers and it's easier for school
 
07:08:01.010 --> 07:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
districts and I just like to make a
 
07:08:03.530 --> 07:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
comment before I open it up on meeting
 
07:08:06.530 --> 07:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
times remember these people on meetings
 
07:08:08.990 --> 07:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
are also working and they so they fit in
 
07:08:11.330 --> 07:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
the hours that they can either at night
 
07:08:13.368 --> 07:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
or in the morning so you gotta remember
 
07:08:15.468 --> 07:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
they're working too at other jobs in
 
07:08:19.610 --> 07:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
most cases so anybody have any questions
 
07:08:22.128 --> 07:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
07:08:22.138 --> 07:08:23.868 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
you

07:08:23.868 --> 07:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:08:29.628 --> 07:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:32.570 --> 07:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
Jamie Wilder
 
07:08:32.580 --> 07:08:39.368 align:start position:0%
Jamie Wilder
yeah

07:08:39.368 --> 07:08:39.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:42.410 --> 07:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jama Wilder
 
07:08:47.390 --> 07:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I am a parent from Hollis
 
07:08:49.730 --> 07:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
um the hollow school district my
 
07:08:52.190 --> 07:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
children go to Hollis Brookline High
 
07:08:54.948 --> 07:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
School I first want to thank you all for
 
07:08:58.250 --> 07:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
listening to me I'm here today to
 
07:09:00.350 --> 07:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
testify to give you an idea of what's
 
07:09:03.230 --> 07:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
really going on in our schools because I
 
07:09:04.730 --> 07:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of comments today and I
 
07:09:05.930 --> 07:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
think there's some false information
 
07:09:08.110 --> 07:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's going around
 
07:09:11.930 --> 07:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
I have five children I sent the older
 
07:09:15.410 --> 07:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
two to the high school this year where I
 
07:09:17.510 --> 07:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
asked for a complete list of curriculum
 
07:09:19.368 --> 07:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
because I understood that I could opt
 
07:09:21.410 --> 07:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
out of things that I wasn't comfortable
 
07:09:21.420 --> 07:09:22.490 align:start position:0%
out of things that I wasn't comfortable
with

07:09:22.490 --> 07:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:09:24.410 --> 07:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
I tried to be proactive with this
 
07:09:27.468 --> 07:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
knowing um in our in our culture that
 
07:09:29.690 --> 07:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
there's things that I just might not be
 
07:09:31.968 --> 07:09:31.978 align:start position:0%
um aligned with the teaching
 
07:09:34.850 --> 07:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
I was refused that on multiple occasions
 
07:09:38.030 --> 07:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
since August I was told that I could go
 
07:09:40.010 --> 07:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
to Google classrooms through my
 
07:09:40.020 --> 07:09:41.048 align:start position:0%
to Google classrooms through my
children's

07:09:41.048 --> 07:09:41.058 align:start position:0%
children's
 
07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
account and look up what the teachers
 
07:09:46.368 --> 07:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
were posting on that
 
07:09:48.770 --> 07:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
like children started coming home with
 
07:09:51.590 --> 07:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
questionable items and they would take
 
07:09:54.410 --> 07:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
screenshots of it or get the list the
 
07:09:55.968 --> 07:09:55.978 align:start position:0%
name of it it was not on Google
 
07:09:59.030 --> 07:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms I met with the superintendent
 
07:10:00.190 --> 07:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
I've met with the assistant
 
07:10:02.030 --> 07:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent I've met with the
 
07:10:04.368 --> 07:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
principal on multiple occasions and the
 
07:10:06.410 --> 07:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent and had
 
07:10:09.288 --> 07:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
conversations with the um
 
07:10:13.250 --> 07:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
with the other principal who handles uh
 
07:10:15.288 --> 07:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
discipline so he has not been involved
 
07:10:17.930 --> 07:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
as much in the curriculum issues
 
07:10:23.150 --> 07:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
so I I voiced my concerns and they were
 
07:10:25.430 --> 07:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
going on deaf ears I was going to school
 
07:10:27.310 --> 07:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
board meeting after school board meeting
 
07:10:29.930 --> 07:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
policy committees and budget committees
 
07:10:31.730 --> 07:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
any way that I could get my three
 
07:10:34.128 --> 07:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
minutes to talk to the board and I was
 
07:10:37.010 --> 07:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
being ignored all the way around
 
07:10:39.288 --> 07:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
so I went through the process of
 
07:10:41.868 --> 07:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
volunteering I did over six hours of
 
07:10:44.270 --> 07:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
volunteering to basically get an
 
07:10:47.208 --> 07:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be more involved in my
 
07:10:49.250 --> 07:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
children's education
 
07:10:51.590 --> 07:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
07:10:53.570 --> 07:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
um my children were coming home like I
 
07:10:55.430 --> 07:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
said with several issues there was a
 
07:10:58.368 --> 07:10:58.378 align:start position:0%
suicide in the school and I don't know
 
07:11:00.830 --> 07:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
if all of you are aware of it but many
 
07:11:02.448 --> 07:11:02.458 align:start position:0%
of our children in the state and
 
07:11:04.368 --> 07:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
throughout the nation right now are
 
07:11:07.128 --> 07:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
drowning because of the fact of the
 
07:11:10.730 --> 07:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
lockdowns and there there's overdoses
 
07:11:13.850 --> 07:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
there's depression there's anxiety
 
07:11:17.208 --> 07:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
based around many different issues and
 
07:11:19.010 --> 07:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
our kids are not being educated right
 
07:11:21.110 --> 07:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
now and that is my main priority for my
 
07:11:21.120 --> 07:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
now and that is my main priority for my
children

07:11:22.250 --> 07:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:11:24.530 --> 07:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
so after the education after my
 
07:11:26.570 --> 07:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
volunteering time was done I was told by
 
07:11:27.830 --> 07:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the school that they had no
 
07:11:29.868 --> 07:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
opportunities for me and that if I
 
07:11:32.628 --> 07:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to volunteer I needed to get in
 
07:11:34.610 --> 07:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
touch with the parent student teacher
 
07:11:34.620 --> 07:11:35.930 align:start position:0%
touch with the parent student teacher
Association

07:11:35.930 --> 07:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
Association
 
07:11:38.390 --> 07:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
I asked specifically for observation
 
07:11:41.570 --> 07:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
time which I was denied by the principal
 
07:11:43.910 --> 07:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
assistant principal and superintendent
 
07:11:47.750 --> 07:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
citing the fact and I mentioned the Essa
 
07:11:50.868 --> 07:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
law that was was mentioned earlier I was
 
07:11:52.730 --> 07:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
told that because of their contracts
 
07:11:56.208 --> 07:11:56.218 align:start position:0%
with the teachers union and child
 
07:11:59.390 --> 07:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
privacy I was not allowed in the school
 
07:12:02.390 --> 07:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
building during school hours
 
07:12:04.850 --> 07:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
I have never had a meeting with a
 
07:12:07.128 --> 07:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
teacher in person they are now telling
 
07:12:09.230 --> 07:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
me and I have this all documented in
 
07:12:11.810 --> 07:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
emails they're now telling me that I am
 
07:12:14.270 --> 07:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
not allowed to question any curriculum
 
07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
with the teachers without an
 
07:12:17.448 --> 07:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
administrator there
 
07:12:20.390 --> 07:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
they said that because of how I've been
 
07:12:23.150 --> 07:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
approaching the situation that they feel
 
07:12:25.368 --> 07:12:25.378 align:start position:0%
in light of what's going on in the
 
07:12:27.770 --> 07:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
nation that I'm not
 
07:12:31.788 --> 07:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
um that I am going to offend the
 
07:12:31.798 --> 07:12:32.868 align:start position:0%
um that I am going to offend the
teachers

07:12:32.868 --> 07:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
07:12:36.230 --> 07:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
so basically where we're at right now is
 
07:12:38.208 --> 07:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
I am pulling my children out of school
 
07:12:40.968 --> 07:12:40.978 align:start position:0%
they got kicked out of school
 
07:12:43.910 --> 07:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um for two weeks because they refused a
 
07:12:45.590 --> 07:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
mask mandate which our superintendent
 
07:12:49.270 --> 07:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
put in place when we were not in school
 
07:12:52.128 --> 07:12:52.138 align:start position:0%
could you please keep it with what
 
07:12:55.910 --> 07:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
I can prepare how that goes with the
 
07:12:57.410 --> 07:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
bill in question so the reason I'm
 
07:12:58.610 --> 07:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
painting the picture is because I've
 
07:13:00.590 --> 07:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
underlined all of the ways that I would
 
07:13:03.230 --> 07:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
be able to get involved what is going on
 
07:13:06.288 --> 07:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
right now is if you don't have an RSA to
 
07:13:08.208 --> 07:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
support what you're doing it doesn't
 
07:13:10.548 --> 07:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
matter if there's federal law or there's
 
07:13:13.070 --> 07:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
the school board's policy or their
 
07:13:15.590 --> 07:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
handbook I have gotten every single
 
07:13:18.590 --> 07:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
policy and I'm I'm scouring through it
 
07:13:21.410 --> 07:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
right now they have broken so many of
 
07:13:24.890 --> 07:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
their own policies and laws and I have
 
07:13:26.570 --> 07:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
no rights
 
07:13:29.628 --> 07:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
so my only right right now the only way
 
07:13:32.810 --> 07:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
to take back my children's education and
 
07:13:34.368 --> 07:13:34.378 align:start position:0%
just so you know when my children got
 
07:13:36.468 --> 07:13:36.478 align:start position:0%
kicked out of school I started reading
 
07:13:38.990 --> 07:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
books with them my sophomore is reading
 
07:13:42.288 --> 07:13:42.298 align:start position:0%
books at a lexicon level of 700 which is
 
07:13:45.530 --> 07:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
a fourth or fifth grade reading level
 
07:13:48.890 --> 07:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
these kids are not being taught and I
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I I want this stated too the way
 
07:13:53.750 --> 07:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
that you're getting your information for
 
07:13:56.690 --> 07:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
their standards is the national
 
07:13:58.788 --> 07:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
um report card the federal government
 
07:14:01.490 --> 07:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
comes in and tests a select group of
 
07:14:03.890 --> 07:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
students and they use that as how
 
07:14:07.850 --> 07:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:10.070 --> 07:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
I will tell you
 
07:14:13.368 --> 07:14:13.378 align:start position:0%
the reason I want this to pass so so
 
07:14:15.770 --> 07:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
much is because I care about my
 
07:14:18.650 --> 07:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
children's education and being involved
 
07:14:21.650 --> 07:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
I am a parent and I want to help the
 
07:14:24.650 --> 07:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
schools better educate the children
 
07:14:27.048 --> 07:14:27.058 align:start position:0%
I want there to be evidence-based and
 
07:14:29.208 --> 07:14:29.218 align:start position:0%
measurable methods for assessing the
 
07:14:31.670 --> 07:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
student performance
 
07:14:35.048 --> 07:14:35.058 align:start position:0%
I believe that there should be ethical
 
07:14:37.430 --> 07:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
standards of behavior for these board
 
07:14:40.730 --> 07:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
members as it stated before there's not
 
07:14:43.010 --> 07:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
nothing to hold them accountable I could
 
07:14:45.110 --> 07:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
wait a decade before I change this board
 
07:14:45.120 --> 07:14:46.788 align:start position:0%
wait a decade before I change this board
over

07:14:46.788 --> 07:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
over
 
07:14:49.548 --> 07:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
the conduct of annual performance
 
07:14:51.410 --> 07:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
reviews of the district superintendent
 
07:14:54.230 --> 07:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
as an employee of the board he is an
 
07:14:56.990 --> 07:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
employee he's not the boss and he acts
 
07:14:59.510 --> 07:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
like he is a king in our town and he
 
07:15:00.770 --> 07:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't listen
 
07:15:03.048 --> 07:15:03.058 align:start position:0%
I want to promote parental engagement
 
07:15:05.030 --> 07:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
and participation
 
07:15:08.570 --> 07:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
I have gone to public meetings
 
07:15:11.030 --> 07:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
I've made public comments and I've been
 
07:15:12.948 --> 07:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
cut off
 
07:15:16.548 --> 07:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
I have had parental engagement I want
 
07:15:20.208 --> 07:15:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:22.490 --> 07:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for parents to review
 
07:15:25.070 --> 07:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
and select selection of printed or
 
07:15:27.770 --> 07:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
digital textbooks or reading lists I
 
07:15:30.170 --> 07:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
just want transparency and I want the
 
07:15:32.628 --> 07:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
schools to be educating our children
 
07:15:34.730 --> 07:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
to a high standard
 
07:15:37.430 --> 07:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline High School which I
 
07:15:40.548 --> 07:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
graduated from in 1999 is known
 
07:15:43.070 --> 07:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for a great school
 
07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
system it is not one now
 
07:15:48.170 --> 07:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
and there is no way that I can hold them
 
07:15:51.890 --> 07:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
accountable I pay over twelve thousand
 
07:15:54.708 --> 07:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
dollars in taxes a year to be told that
 
07:15:56.330 --> 07:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
I cannot be part of my children's
 
07:15:59.330 --> 07:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
education and it's wrong
 
07:16:02.570 --> 07:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
so I stand here before you pleading that
 
07:16:06.468 --> 07:16:06.478 align:start position:0%
you would pass a law that allows me to
 
07:16:08.448 --> 07:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
stand up for what's right and my
 
07:16:10.548 --> 07:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
children's education and for the other
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
kids it's not just our town I know of
 
07:16:16.010 --> 07:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
several sau's throughout the state that
 
07:16:17.990 --> 07:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
are dealing with the same thing I've
 
07:16:20.990 --> 07:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
been in contact with these moms I we are
 
07:16:23.448 --> 07:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
collecting journals of information on
 
07:16:25.490 --> 07:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
CRT and other things so that we can
 
07:16:28.730 --> 07:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
share it and say this is happening all
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
throughout our state and no one's
 
07:16:32.570 --> 07:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
listening because you want to keep it at
 
07:16:35.570 --> 07:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
the local level but they make excuses
 
07:16:37.910 --> 07:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and say if there's not an RSA we're not
 
07:16:39.770 --> 07:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
breaking any laws
 
07:16:42.650 --> 07:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
this is why it is so important for me to
 
07:16:44.690 --> 07:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
that this passes
 
07:16:47.510 --> 07:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:51.590 --> 07:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:53.570 --> 07:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay with that thank you for your
 
07:16:56.448 --> 07:16:56.458 align:start position:0%
testimony and we have no more pink cards
 
07:16:59.930 --> 07:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
so I guess we'll
 
07:17:01.910 --> 07:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
close this
 
07:17:05.570 --> 07:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
hearing and move on to the next one
 
07:17:11.810 --> 07:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:13.548 --> 07:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
07:17:20.690 --> 07:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:27.368 --> 07:17:27.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:32.810 --> 07:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:32.820 --> 07:17:43.070 align:start position:0%
 
1169

07:17:43.070 --> 07:17:43.080 align:start position:0%

your work and attention and
 
07:19:02.628 --> 07:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:09.170 --> 07:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:11.750 --> 07:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill is somewhat similar to
 
07:19:14.270 --> 07:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
what we were talking about with the
 
07:19:17.270 --> 07:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
previous bill this Bill establishes
 
07:19:20.208 --> 07:19:20.218 align:start position:0%
requirements for public meetings by held
 
07:19:21.590 --> 07:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
by a school board
 
07:19:24.468 --> 07:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
to include a designated time period for
 
07:19:26.270 --> 07:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the public and answers
 
07:19:27.890 --> 07:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
from the school board
 
07:19:30.708 --> 07:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
the bill also allows an attendee of a
 
07:19:33.048 --> 07:19:33.058 align:start position:0%
meeting of the school board to demand
 
07:19:34.850 --> 07:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire statute or
 
07:19:37.010 --> 07:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
administrative rule gives the school
 
07:19:38.930 --> 07:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
board The Authority described in a
 
07:19:41.868 --> 07:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
school policy or operational procedure
 
07:19:44.090 --> 07:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
with the introduction of this bill to
 
07:19:46.548 --> 07:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
your committee I want to First establish
 
07:19:48.830 --> 07:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
that school board members are elected by
 
07:19:51.350 --> 07:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
the voters in their District as per the
 
07:19:54.110 --> 07:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
statutes under RSA 671
 
07:19:57.288 --> 07:19:57.298 align:start position:0%
elections are defined under RSA 652
 
07:20:01.310 --> 07:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
colon 1 and RSA 652 colon 9. because
 
07:20:03.048 --> 07:20:03.058 align:start position:0%
school board members are elected
 
07:20:05.150 --> 07:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
officials they are therefore answerable
 
07:20:08.208 --> 07:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
to the public that they serve as elected
 
07:20:10.430 --> 07:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
officials they are elected to craft
 
07:20:12.770 --> 07:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
policy for the school district and
 
07:20:15.110 --> 07:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
represent their constituents and they
 
07:20:17.390 --> 07:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
must be held accountable to those
 
07:20:17.400 --> 07:20:19.670 align:start position:0%
must be held accountable to those
constituents

07:20:19.670 --> 07:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
07:20:22.910 --> 07:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was born out of many
 
07:20:25.310 --> 07:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and sometimes ugly
 
07:20:27.350 --> 07:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
situations that have happened in school
 
07:20:29.868 --> 07:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
board meetings across this state over
 
07:20:32.448 --> 07:20:32.458 align:start position:0%
the past year
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
parents have essentially been shut out
 
07:20:36.590 --> 07:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
of participating in school board
 
07:20:36.600 --> 07:20:37.850 align:start position:0%
of participating in school board
meetings

07:20:37.850 --> 07:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
07:20:40.190 --> 07:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
have been summarily ignored at these
 
07:20:42.468 --> 07:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
meetings and have not been given their
 
07:20:46.670 --> 07:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
rightful chance to question discuss or
 
07:20:48.468 --> 07:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
voice opinion regarding School Board
 
07:20:51.230 --> 07:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
policy for the schools that they pay for
 
07:20:53.208 --> 07:20:53.218 align:start position:0%
with their taxes
 
07:20:56.448 --> 07:20:56.458 align:start position:0%
this is a wrong that must now be
 
07:20:59.628 --> 07:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
statutorily corrected we cannot allow
 
07:21:02.510 --> 07:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
school boards to be dictatorships they
 
07:21:04.250 --> 07:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
are elected to serve the public not
 
07:21:06.230 --> 07:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
ignore them
 
07:21:08.448 --> 07:21:08.458 align:start position:0%
members of the public must be given
 
07:21:10.250 --> 07:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
their time to voice their concerns
 
07:21:12.770 --> 07:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
question and give comment at these
 
07:21:14.990 --> 07:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
school board meetings regarding school
 
07:21:17.690 --> 07:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
policy procedures and any other function
 
07:21:19.610 --> 07:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
the school board performs
 
07:21:22.250 --> 07:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
this bill makes sure that they get that
 
07:21:22.260 --> 07:21:23.150 align:start position:0%
this bill makes sure that they get that
time

07:21:23.150 --> 07:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:21:25.610 --> 07:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
this is not an unusual or unreasonable
 
07:21:28.430 --> 07:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
requirement yet some school boards do
 
07:21:32.570 --> 07:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:34.430 --> 07:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
when questioned about school board
 
07:21:36.890 --> 07:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
policy or the authority of school boards
 
07:21:39.530 --> 07:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
to make certain policies they must also
 
07:21:41.990 --> 07:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide an answer to the public
 
07:21:43.850 --> 07:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
it is the right of the citizen to
 
07:21:46.190 --> 07:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
question and receive an answer
 
07:21:48.110 --> 07:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
especially since members of the school
 
07:21:49.968 --> 07:21:49.978 align:start position:0%
board were elected to represent the
 
07:21:52.490 --> 07:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
citizens and these citizens are funding
 
07:21:54.948 --> 07:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
the schools with their tax dollars if an
 
07:21:56.930 --> 07:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
answer is not known at the time of the
 
07:21:59.690 --> 07:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
question then it is not unreasonable to
 
07:22:01.310 --> 07:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
require the school board member or
 
07:22:03.708 --> 07:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
administrator to follow up and provide
 
07:22:07.368 --> 07:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
an answer within five business days
 
07:22:10.670 --> 07:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
again as elected officials and policy
 
07:22:14.990 --> 07:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
makers they are answerable to the public
 
07:22:17.030 --> 07:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
if answers are not provided to the
 
07:22:18.350 --> 07:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
public then complaints to the
 
07:22:21.230 --> 07:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education are in order
 
07:22:23.628 --> 07:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
the public should also be made aware
 
07:22:25.910 --> 07:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
through school board minutes which
 
07:22:28.368 --> 07:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
members of the school board refused to
 
07:22:29.868 --> 07:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
07:22:32.628 --> 07:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
that is sure to be a useful that is sure
 
07:22:34.548 --> 07:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
to be useful information to the voters
 
07:22:37.010 --> 07:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
the next time School Board elections
 
07:22:40.190 --> 07:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
come around but it is also a matter of
 
07:22:42.708 --> 07:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:44.810 --> 07:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
it is also not unreasonable to ask
 
07:22:46.610 --> 07:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
school board members what administrative
 
07:22:49.368 --> 07:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
rules and state statutes that give them
 
07:22:51.410 --> 07:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
the authority to make certain school
 
07:22:51.420 --> 07:22:52.850 align:start position:0%
the authority to make certain school
policy

07:22:52.850 --> 07:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
policy
 
07:22:55.490 --> 07:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
this ensures that school boards are not
 
07:22:57.708 --> 07:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
just doing what they want whenever they
 
07:23:00.650 --> 07:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
want without the authority to do so
 
07:23:02.930 --> 07:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
an elected official should not be given
 
07:23:04.850 --> 07:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
themselves power and authority where
 
07:23:06.770 --> 07:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
none exists
 
07:23:09.530 --> 07:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
this is a bill in my opinion that makes
 
07:23:10.968 --> 07:23:10.978 align:start position:0%
good sense
 
07:23:13.368 --> 07:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
it allows public input into important
 
07:23:16.310 --> 07:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
local policy making and holds elected
 
07:23:17.868 --> 07:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
officials accountable
 
07:23:19.788 --> 07:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
I hope that you'll pass this bill out of
 
07:23:21.048 --> 07:23:21.058 align:start position:0%
your committee with an OTP
 
07:23:22.730 --> 07:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I'd be happy to
 
07:23:24.410 --> 07:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
07:23:30.410 --> 07:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:32.090 --> 07:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook
 
07:23:36.650 --> 07:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:39.770 --> 07:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
well as a courtesy
 
07:23:42.048 --> 07:23:42.058 align:start position:0%
we're going to invite the officer not
 
07:23:44.270 --> 07:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
the NCO
 
07:23:52.850 --> 07:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:54.590 --> 07:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm not sure that
 
07:23:57.250 --> 07:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
that was a compliment but I'll accept it
 
07:23:59.868 --> 07:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
for the record Bob guide a state senator
 
07:24:02.930 --> 07:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
for District Two I represent 27 towns
 
07:24:04.250 --> 07:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
crossing the boundaries of three
 
07:24:06.590 --> 07:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
different counties Grafton Belknap and
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
Merrimack uh and I have a lot of small
 
07:24:12.288 --> 07:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
school boards I am a school board member
 
07:24:14.990 --> 07:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think my third term six years
 
07:24:17.270 --> 07:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh and accordingly I
 
07:24:18.770 --> 07:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
I think that what I have to say is
 
07:24:21.110 --> 07:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
apropos our small town we have two not
 
07:24:22.910 --> 07:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
two public sessions at every school
 
07:24:25.128 --> 07:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
board meeting early on
 
07:24:26.750 --> 07:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
and at the end that's for the
 
07:24:29.868 --> 07:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
convenience of the people who ask us to
 
07:24:31.070 --> 07:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
serve them
 
07:24:33.048 --> 07:24:33.058 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of numerous stories of school
 
07:24:34.850 --> 07:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
boards that have a slightly different
 
07:24:36.770 --> 07:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
orientation upon the definition of
 
07:24:36.780 --> 07:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
orientation upon the definition of
service

07:24:38.750 --> 07:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
service
 
07:24:40.910 --> 07:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
and have caused significant problems and
 
07:24:42.708 --> 07:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
mistrust amongst the people who pay the
 
07:24:42.718 --> 07:24:45.708 align:start position:0%
mistrust amongst the people who pay the
freight

07:24:45.708 --> 07:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:47.390 --> 07:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've been at school board meetings where
 
07:24:49.730 --> 07:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
things start to get unruly that's why
 
07:24:51.230 --> 07:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
you have a chair the chair is
 
07:24:52.910 --> 07:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for the governance of the
 
07:24:54.350 --> 07:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
conduct of the meeting
 
07:24:56.750 --> 07:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
if things get unruly you wrap the gavel
 
07:24:58.250 --> 07:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
you take a recess everybody gets a
 
07:25:00.110 --> 07:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
breather and then you move back into the
 
07:25:02.208 --> 07:25:02.218 align:start position:0%
conduct of business
 
07:25:04.368 --> 07:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
there's no need to use unruly Behavior
 
07:25:06.530 --> 07:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
as a means to truncate the First
 
07:25:08.030 --> 07:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights
 
07:25:10.368 --> 07:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
of the citizens whose children for whom
 
07:25:15.230 --> 07:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:18.170 --> 07:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
virtually every component of the
 
07:25:20.150 --> 07:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
education structure has a representation
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
in an organization that is highly paid
 
07:25:24.410 --> 07:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
and very skilled at defending their
 
07:25:25.910 --> 07:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
respective positions whether it's the
 
07:25:27.770 --> 07:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
administrators Association School boards
 
07:25:27.780 --> 07:25:29.448 align:start position:0%
administrators Association School boards
Association

07:25:29.448 --> 07:25:29.458 align:start position:0%
Association
 
07:25:32.628 --> 07:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
or the teachers in many cases unionized
 
07:25:36.288 --> 07:25:36.298 align:start position:0%
but in most cases organized anyway
 
07:25:38.270 --> 07:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:25:41.570 --> 07:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
we are the lobbyist for the parent and
 
07:25:43.190 --> 07:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
the child
 
07:25:45.230 --> 07:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
we the state legislature we have
 
07:25:47.270 --> 07:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations we know that
 
07:25:49.968 --> 07:25:49.978 align:start position:0%
the child's benefit is in the hands of
 
07:25:52.548 --> 07:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
the parents primarily
 
07:25:54.890 --> 07:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
truncate the ability of parents
 
07:25:58.128 --> 07:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
at any instance on any agenda item
 
07:26:00.410 --> 07:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
to interject their thoughts and direct
 
07:26:03.650 --> 07:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
Those Who quote unquote serve is a grave
 
07:26:03.660 --> 07:26:05.208 align:start position:0%
Those Who quote unquote serve is a grave
disservice

07:26:05.208 --> 07:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
disservice
 
07:26:07.730 --> 07:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
we need to fix that problem and we can
 
07:26:10.368 --> 07:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
fix that problem constructively
 
07:26:13.490 --> 07:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
the issue here is one of accountability
 
07:26:15.890 --> 07:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
school board that has three members
 
07:26:18.948 --> 07:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
will take at least three years
 
07:26:21.350 --> 07:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
to repair if the conduct of any member
 
07:26:24.770 --> 07:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
or or the aggregate of members is not
 
07:26:24.780 --> 07:26:26.030 align:start position:0%
or or the aggregate of members is not
satisfactory

07:26:26.030 --> 07:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
satisfactory
 
07:26:29.030 --> 07:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
meantime a child has advanced through
 
07:26:31.490 --> 07:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
three more years of whatever the policy
 
07:26:32.690 --> 07:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
might be that was considered
 
07:26:32.700 --> 07:26:38.628 align:start position:0%
might be that was considered
objectionable

07:26:38.628 --> 07:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:40.788 --> 07:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that perhaps one way to
 
07:26:42.230 --> 07:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish this
 
07:26:44.750 --> 07:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
is to require a public hearing
 
07:26:46.850 --> 07:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
after a public meeting after the school
 
07:26:48.830 --> 07:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
board meeting
 
07:26:51.230 --> 07:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
by law school meetings do not have to
 
07:26:53.628 --> 07:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
have public input but hearings are in
 
07:26:55.788 --> 07:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
fact designed for that purpose you can
 
07:26:57.830 --> 07:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
also design meetings to have a business
 
07:27:00.350 --> 07:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
component and a time element for that
 
07:27:02.030 --> 07:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
07:27:04.250 --> 07:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
agenda items that are non-business okay
 
07:27:06.410 --> 07:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
policy changes and so forth so there's
 
07:27:08.570 --> 07:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
ways to do this if there's a will I
 
07:27:11.270 --> 07:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
think we as elected members okay of the
 
07:27:13.190 --> 07:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislature of New Hampshire
 
07:27:15.230 --> 07:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
in accordance with our constitutionally
 
07:27:17.750 --> 07:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
sworn obligations and the fact that we
 
07:27:19.968 --> 07:27:19.978 align:start position:0%
are the lobbyist if you will for parents
 
07:27:22.310 --> 07:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
and children in an arena that is very
 
07:27:24.948 --> 07:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
much punctuated by other interests that
 
07:27:26.390 --> 07:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
are special to their own Specialties
 
07:27:27.890 --> 07:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
whether they're administrators teachers
 
07:27:31.490 --> 07:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
or School boards okay we are the ones
 
07:27:33.530 --> 07:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
that should set the policy and requiring
 
07:27:35.150 --> 07:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
public input
 
07:27:37.490 --> 07:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
at a meeting in which the future of our
 
07:27:39.650 --> 07:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
children is at stake I think is the only
 
07:27:41.510 --> 07:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do and I ask you to
 
07:27:42.890 --> 07:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
please support this bill is ought to
 
07:27:44.570 --> 07:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
pass thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:27:46.190 --> 07:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
very much Senator do you care to take
 
07:27:47.990 --> 07:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions yes sir
 
07:27:50.990 --> 07:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Porter your hand is up
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
07:27:55.670 --> 07:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
07:27:57.468 --> 07:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
um you said you served on a school board
 
07:28:01.788 --> 07:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:03.650 --> 07:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
according to
 
07:28:06.948 --> 07:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
change lines 15 through 17 in this bill
 
07:28:09.650 --> 07:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
18 in this bill
 
07:28:12.590 --> 07:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
says during any public meeting held by a
 
07:28:14.990 --> 07:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
school board an attendee May demand
 
07:28:17.448 --> 07:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire statute or
 
07:28:19.128 --> 07:28:19.138 align:start position:0%
administrative rule
 
07:28:21.110 --> 07:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
gives the school board The Authority
 
07:28:24.048 --> 07:28:24.058 align:start position:0%
described in a school policy or
 
07:28:27.110 --> 07:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
operational procedure the school board
 
07:28:30.110 --> 07:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
shall immediately respond with a
 
07:28:32.930 --> 07:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
citation to its Authority could you do
 
07:28:32.940 --> 07:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
citation to its Authority could you do
that

07:28:34.310 --> 07:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:28:35.930 --> 07:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
I think there's also a provision in the
 
07:28:37.610 --> 07:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
law that says I have a time frame if I
 
07:28:39.288 --> 07:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
can't no it doesn't
 
07:28:41.030 --> 07:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
if the school board is unable to respond
 
07:28:41.040 --> 07:28:44.208 align:start position:0%
if the school board is unable to respond
affirmatively

07:28:44.208 --> 07:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:44.218 --> 07:28:46.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:28:46.788 --> 07:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:48.230 --> 07:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
the procedure shall be immediately
 
07:28:49.670 --> 07:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawn until such time that the board
 
07:28:51.708 --> 07:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
can show it has such Authority could you
 
07:28:53.868 --> 07:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
do that in three days
 
07:28:55.430 --> 07:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
I would make it a point to do that
 
07:28:57.708 --> 07:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
because I serve I would also state that
 
07:28:59.570 --> 07:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
understanding as a small school board
 
07:29:01.968 --> 07:29:01.978 align:start position:0%
member okay many times what happens to
 
07:29:03.770 --> 07:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
school boards given the incredible
 
07:29:06.048 --> 07:29:06.058 align:start position:0%
volume of administrative rules
 
07:29:08.390 --> 07:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that the SAU and superintendent
 
07:29:10.788 --> 07:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
become de facto
 
07:29:13.250 --> 07:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay the deciders of policy and they
 
07:29:14.810 --> 07:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
present things that school boards don't
 
07:29:14.820 --> 07:29:15.948 align:start position:0%
present things that school boards don't
understand

07:29:15.948 --> 07:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:29:19.730 --> 07:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay so again we have a we need as as a
 
07:29:22.430 --> 07:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislator Our obligation is to make the
 
07:29:24.110 --> 07:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
process transparent
 
07:29:27.170 --> 07:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
and comfortable or not to ensure that
 
07:29:29.390 --> 07:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
the accountability is there I would
 
07:29:31.128 --> 07:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
submit that a question that was asked to
 
07:29:32.690 --> 07:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
me that I didn't know the answer to
 
07:29:34.730 --> 07:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
would present me with an opportunity to
 
07:29:35.930 --> 07:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
learn and therefore become a better
 
07:29:39.650 --> 07:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
qualified School Board member follow up
 
07:29:42.770 --> 07:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead in our committee meetings
 
07:29:44.990 --> 07:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
here in the state house we're not
 
07:29:48.350 --> 07:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to question each other back and
 
07:29:50.390 --> 07:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
forth we're not allowed to have a
 
07:29:53.510 --> 07:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue between ourselves the 10th
 
07:29:56.468 --> 07:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
person who's testifying takes questions
 
07:30:00.410 --> 07:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
and responds to one person at a time but
 
07:30:03.530 --> 07:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
if this policy were enacted would it be
 
07:30:07.010 --> 07:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
possible for a member of the audience to
 
07:30:09.468 --> 07:30:09.478 align:start position:0%
question representative leckis on a
 
07:30:10.850 --> 07:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
specific thing in the middle of a school
 
07:30:12.770 --> 07:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
board meeting or would she have to go
 
07:30:15.530 --> 07:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
through the chair as we do or how would
 
07:30:18.230 --> 07:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
that work I think I'd refer to Chairman
 
07:30:20.270 --> 07:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
lad's comments in the last bill that's a
 
07:30:21.948 --> 07:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
local issue and the chairman can control
 
07:30:24.530 --> 07:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
that however he or she chooses all right
 
07:30:26.330 --> 07:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
bill is pretty specific
 
07:30:28.010 --> 07:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
I would also offer that there are
 
07:30:29.930 --> 07:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
amendments possible to the bill thank
 
07:30:29.940 --> 07:30:33.770 align:start position:0%
amendments possible to the bill thank
you

07:30:33.770 --> 07:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:36.468 --> 07:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
that is correct we can amend areas where
 
07:30:41.390 --> 07:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
we see a change May improve the bill
 
07:30:44.330 --> 07:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
or modify the bill
 
07:30:46.310 --> 07:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
further are you done representative
 
07:30:49.368 --> 07:30:49.378 align:start position:0%
Porter is that thank you are there other
 
07:30:52.850 --> 07:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
07:30:54.350 --> 07:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ford then
 
07:30:55.910 --> 07:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative Walt
 
07:30:57.530 --> 07:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
school first because I I saw your hand
 
07:30:59.570 --> 07:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
up first and then I'll go to rep Center
 
07:30:59.580 --> 07:31:00.410 align:start position:0%
up first and then I'll go to rep Center
Ford

07:31:00.410 --> 07:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
Ford
 
07:31:03.410 --> 07:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
so uh Senator Garden nice to see you see
 
07:31:05.330 --> 07:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
you thank you um we have a procedure in
 
07:31:06.708 --> 07:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
the state whereby when people have
 
07:31:08.750 --> 07:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions be it at a state level or a
 
07:31:10.490 --> 07:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
local level they have a right task and
 
07:31:12.288 --> 07:31:12.298 align:start position:0%
the right to know law and in the right
 
07:31:14.208 --> 07:31:14.218 align:start position:0%
to know law if the state doesn't keep
 
07:31:16.310 --> 07:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
that data it doesn't have that data or
 
07:31:17.810 --> 07:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
the town of the school district they
 
07:31:19.788 --> 07:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
don't have to compile that data you know
 
07:31:21.948 --> 07:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
if I ask for some obscure long list that
 
07:31:23.810 --> 07:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
the school district doesn't keep they
 
07:31:25.610 --> 07:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
don't have to compile that data for me
 
07:31:28.788 --> 07:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
but by opening this up to questions and
 
07:31:30.530 --> 07:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
expecting that the school board is going
 
07:31:32.570 --> 07:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
to answer all these questions within
 
07:31:34.968 --> 07:31:34.978 align:start position:0%
five days within no limitations that
 
07:31:36.770 --> 07:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
even if they don't have the data or
 
07:31:38.570 --> 07:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things aren't we going
 
07:31:40.430 --> 07:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
against the long tradition of the the
 
07:31:42.410 --> 07:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
right to know law and aren't we creating
 
07:31:44.570 --> 07:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps enormous amounts of work for
 
07:31:47.090 --> 07:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
school boards and school districts
 
07:31:49.010 --> 07:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the context of
 
07:31:55.430 --> 07:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:58.250 --> 07:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:59.868 --> 07:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
everything that's going to be taught to
 
07:32:01.730 --> 07:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
my child this year in third grade you
 
07:32:01.740 --> 07:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
my child this year in third grade you
know

07:32:02.390 --> 07:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:32:04.010 --> 07:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
the teacher hasn't even put the lesson
 
07:32:06.350 --> 07:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
plan together yet okay but there's an
 
07:32:07.730 --> 07:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
obligation of the school district then
 
07:32:09.770 --> 07:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
to come up with that lesson plan for all
 
07:32:12.350 --> 07:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
180 days of school the way I read this
 
07:32:14.330 --> 07:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
bill that if somebody asks for it you
 
07:32:16.430 --> 07:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to provide it and what I'm
 
07:32:18.110 --> 07:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that under the right to
 
07:32:20.330 --> 07:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
know law if that information doesn't
 
07:32:22.850 --> 07:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
exist you don't have to provide it yet
 
07:32:25.070 --> 07:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written you're
 
07:32:26.330 --> 07:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
going to have to create that information
 
07:32:27.948 --> 07:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
or have somebody create that information
 
07:32:30.770 --> 07:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
there is no exit for the fact that that
 
07:32:33.230 --> 07:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
information doesn't already exist with
 
07:32:34.670 --> 07:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
all due respect I would disagree with
 
07:32:37.368 --> 07:32:37.378 align:start position:0%
your interpretation of 91a it says if
 
07:32:39.530 --> 07:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's too onerous you get a bigger time
 
07:32:42.048 --> 07:32:42.058 align:start position:0%
frame and if it cannot be produced then
 
07:32:43.788 --> 07:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
a letter to that effect is sent back to
 
07:32:50.810 --> 07:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:55.250 --> 07:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:01.490 --> 07:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:03.890 --> 07:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
it won't come any further he had to
 
07:33:06.288 --> 07:33:06.298 align:start position:0%
change links
 
07:33:10.128 --> 07:33:10.138 align:start position:0%
this way my concern is for those issues
 
07:33:13.128 --> 07:33:13.138 align:start position:0%
that rise to the point of
 
07:33:15.650 --> 07:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'll call it incoherence in a public
 
07:33:18.830 --> 07:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
meeting to where the abuse the verbal
 
07:33:21.350 --> 07:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
abuse becomes abuse
 
07:33:23.750 --> 07:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
physical abuse almost and the threat of
 
07:33:25.128 --> 07:33:25.138 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
 
07:33:27.530 --> 07:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
and in a prior conversation I was
 
07:33:29.930 --> 07:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
talking about at that point I think the
 
07:33:32.510 --> 07:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
chair should simply cease that
 
07:33:32.520 --> 07:33:33.708 align:start position:0%
chair should simply cease that
discussion

07:33:33.708 --> 07:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
07:33:35.930 --> 07:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant when I said shut
 
07:33:38.150 --> 07:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
down the discussion and continuing it
 
07:33:40.730 --> 07:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
when there's sufficient order to have a
 
07:33:42.770 --> 07:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
rational dialogue
 
07:33:45.770 --> 07:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
is how does that fit in
 
07:33:48.288 --> 07:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
your understanding of Our obligation
 
07:33:50.990 --> 07:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the public school boards
 
07:33:53.150 --> 07:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with the public and that sort of
 
07:33:54.530 --> 07:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
thing thank you for the question I think
 
07:33:56.390 --> 07:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's entirely appropriate what you
 
07:33:58.430 --> 07:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
say again it's within the role of the
 
07:34:00.410 --> 07:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
chairman or chairwoman
 
07:34:02.030 --> 07:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
to control the conduct of the meeting
 
07:34:04.128 --> 07:34:04.138 align:start position:0%
when things start getting unruly we're
 
07:34:05.448 --> 07:34:05.458 align:start position:0%
going to take a five-minute recess
 
07:34:07.788 --> 07:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
people calm down and we'll get back to
 
07:34:09.708 --> 07:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
the business of the board again it's
 
07:34:11.868 --> 07:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's in a matter of how the meeting is
 
07:34:14.330 --> 07:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
conducted someone gets unruly you stop
 
07:34:16.910 --> 07:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting a threat that rises to the
 
07:34:18.468 --> 07:34:18.478 align:start position:0%
point of potential physical harm is
 
07:34:19.968 --> 07:34:19.978 align:start position:0%
actually a crime
 
07:34:21.650 --> 07:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
all right and a person might need to be
 
07:34:23.030 --> 07:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
reminded of that
 
07:34:24.890 --> 07:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
Again part of running meetings is
 
07:34:26.750 --> 07:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the parameters and and the
 
07:34:29.090 --> 07:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations relating to the
 
07:34:30.468 --> 07:34:30.478 align:start position:0%
interaction of people when it gets
 
07:34:32.690 --> 07:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
confrontational which sometimes it does
 
07:34:34.788 --> 07:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
but again the chairman a good chair will
 
07:34:36.770 --> 07:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
in fact manage that meeting in such a
 
07:34:38.930 --> 07:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
way that as he or she sees conflict
 
07:34:40.430 --> 07:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
starting to arise
 
07:34:42.350 --> 07:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
bang the gavel take a couple minutes
 
07:34:45.170 --> 07:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
calm down and and uh I've never seen a
 
07:34:49.010 --> 07:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:50.628 --> 07:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are the further
 
07:34:53.330 --> 07:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:55.310 --> 07:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
for the are you pointing to yours oh
 
07:34:55.320 --> 07:34:56.330 align:start position:0%

07:34:57.948 --> 07:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
07:34:59.628 --> 07:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
07:35:08.868 --> 07:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:20.330 --> 07:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:25.670 --> 07:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:27.948 --> 07:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
for the record uh first of all thank you
 
07:35:29.390 --> 07:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and the rest of the
 
07:35:30.770 --> 07:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
committee there for your loyalty and
 
07:35:33.350 --> 07:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
dedication and staying on with us here
 
07:35:35.390 --> 07:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I know what it is to be here for
 
07:35:38.208 --> 07:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
late nights for the last so 15 years of
 
07:35:40.128 --> 07:35:40.138 align:start position:0%
my time but but anyways representative
 
07:35:41.868 --> 07:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
alball the South Rockingham County
 
07:35:45.110 --> 07:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
District 5 which is Londonderry I was on
 
07:35:46.250 --> 07:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
it I didn't even know one of my
 
07:35:48.948 --> 07:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
constituents coming up here and I
 
07:35:51.110 --> 07:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually kind of fit in what I was going
 
07:35:53.150 --> 07:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
to talk about that this isn't a
 
07:35:54.770 --> 07:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democratic issue
 
07:35:57.708 --> 07:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
especially in my town okay because one
 
07:35:59.750 --> 07:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
of my fellow Democrat rep uh
 
07:36:02.390 --> 07:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
constituents came up here to speak out
 
07:36:04.730 --> 07:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
and I was honored to see that because
 
07:36:07.128 --> 07:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
this is a parent issue okay that's going
 
07:36:10.548 --> 07:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
on in Londonderry and and I made a clear
 
07:36:12.770 --> 07:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
to him at a meeting that if you could
 
07:36:14.628 --> 07:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
not fix the public comment this has been
 
07:36:16.190 --> 07:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
going on not just for covert for the
 
07:36:18.708 --> 07:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
last five years we had a chairman in the
 
07:36:21.350 --> 07:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
town there who didn't run okay who used
 
07:36:24.410 --> 07:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
to stop public comment now we hold
 
07:36:27.410 --> 07:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
legislation uh earrings here for public
 
07:36:29.270 --> 07:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
comment to come in before you pass the
 
07:36:31.788 --> 07:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
hearing the school board would pass all
 
07:36:34.250 --> 07:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
the policy and everything that going on
 
07:36:35.930 --> 07:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
that they wanted parents were sitting
 
07:36:38.208 --> 07:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
out there came to speak against those
 
07:36:41.448 --> 07:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
agenda items and then at the end of the
 
07:36:44.330 --> 07:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
night at 10 30 11 o'clock at night then
 
07:36:45.650 --> 07:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
get to speak
 
07:36:47.570 --> 07:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
I've seen sometimes where kids sleeping
 
07:36:49.968 --> 07:36:49.978 align:start position:0%
on their laps I see many parents go home
 
07:36:51.590 --> 07:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with this in a long
 
07:36:53.628 --> 07:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
time going in and out uh the school
 
07:36:55.310 --> 07:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
board because I you know as you know I'm
 
07:36:58.070 --> 07:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
a quiet guy and my constituents asked me
 
07:36:59.990 --> 07:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
all the time to come to the board and
 
07:37:01.548 --> 07:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
try to help them out and speak up for
 
07:37:02.810 --> 07:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
them because they're not getting any
 
07:37:02.820 --> 07:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
them because they're not getting any
satisfaction

07:37:04.310 --> 07:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
07:37:08.208 --> 07:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
this legislation in my opinion is a form
 
07:37:10.310 --> 07:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
of redress of grievance
 
07:37:12.110 --> 07:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
for the people it's a constitutional
 
07:37:15.650 --> 07:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
issue they're speaking out I've seen
 
07:37:19.070 --> 07:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
disrespect I've from my board I've seen
 
07:37:21.468 --> 07:37:21.478 align:start position:0%
them not answer questions on parents on
 
07:37:23.570 --> 07:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
a kid who got in trouble that got no
 
07:37:25.430 --> 07:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
voice from the superintendent from the
 
07:37:27.708 --> 07:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
teacher anyone else go to the board and
 
07:37:30.468 --> 07:37:30.478 align:start position:0%
ask for help and they refuse and they
 
07:37:32.150 --> 07:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
look at them and treat it like you're
 
07:37:34.610 --> 07:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
garbage why are you talking to us
 
07:37:36.890 --> 07:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
questions are being asked and they're
 
07:37:39.650 --> 07:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
ignoring them then you wonder why
 
07:37:42.350 --> 07:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
parents are getting aggravated
 
07:37:45.110 --> 07:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
we put a committee in place in my town
 
07:37:47.390 --> 07:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the school board and they came up
 
07:37:49.610 --> 07:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
with a plan of optional mask
 
07:37:52.250 --> 07:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
but it was a waste of time because they
 
07:37:54.708 --> 07:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
School Board went the opposite of what
 
07:37:56.810 --> 07:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
that board's recommendation was where
 
07:37:59.208 --> 07:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
you know its Master the school uh
 
07:38:02.030 --> 07:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
naturally parents are mad okay this this
 
07:38:04.190 --> 07:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
is a major issue here but like I said
 
07:38:06.468 --> 07:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
the the public climate has gone on a
 
07:38:08.990 --> 07:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
long time before and so it's just been
 
07:38:11.208 --> 07:38:11.218 align:start position:0%
building up because what my town did was
 
07:38:13.548 --> 07:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
two people resigned they brought back
 
07:38:16.010 --> 07:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
that same chairman before that stopped
 
07:38:17.150 --> 07:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
07:38:19.128 --> 07:38:19.138 align:start position:0%
that made it to late at night and then
 
07:38:20.628 --> 07:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden now public comment is
 
07:38:22.910 --> 07:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
late at night so people cannot speak
 
07:38:25.310 --> 07:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
against anything that's on the agenda
 
07:38:27.048 --> 07:38:27.058 align:start position:0%
until it's already passed and it's too
 
07:38:29.510 --> 07:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
late when they ask questions about the
 
07:38:31.910 --> 07:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
laws they won't answer them when one
 
07:38:34.910 --> 07:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
mother said I wrote the superintendent I
 
07:38:37.368 --> 07:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
wrote the teacher I got nowhere
 
07:38:40.910 --> 07:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
I once spoke myself a few quite a few
 
07:38:42.890 --> 07:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
times of course they sent me to the
 
07:38:44.990 --> 07:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
ethics board nothing happened but you
 
07:38:47.208 --> 07:38:47.218 align:start position:0%
know because I told the vice uh the
 
07:38:49.850 --> 07:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
deputy superintendent there that you
 
07:38:52.850 --> 07:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
should resign okay because y'all failure
 
07:38:55.368 --> 07:38:55.378 align:start position:0%
to tell these parents what's going on
 
07:38:56.990 --> 07:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
with their children answering their
 
07:38:59.570 --> 07:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
questions would save a lot of problem we
 
07:39:02.030 --> 07:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
have the same problem in the VA when a
 
07:39:03.650 --> 07:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
nurse or a doctor does not call a
 
07:39:05.510 --> 07:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
veteran that Veteran's sitting home
 
07:39:07.670 --> 07:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
going crazy why you didn't call him why
 
07:39:09.708 --> 07:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
aren't they report returning my call
 
07:39:11.750 --> 07:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
why are they doing this that's sometimes
 
07:39:14.090 --> 07:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
suicides and other stuff imagine a
 
07:39:16.430 --> 07:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
parent who sends to a teacher or to a
 
07:39:17.810 --> 07:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
superintendent this is what I'm hearing
 
07:39:19.368 --> 07:39:19.378 align:start position:0%
all the time from parents why they're
 
07:39:21.230 --> 07:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
aggravated they don't answer me you
 
07:39:23.990 --> 07:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
heard that mother you've heard uh my
 
07:39:26.090 --> 07:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
constituent that came up here
 
07:39:28.128 --> 07:39:28.138 align:start position:0%
they're not answering them so naturally
 
07:39:29.890 --> 07:39:29.900 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in their home getting
 
07:39:32.690 --> 07:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
aggravated because they care about their
 
07:39:34.910 --> 07:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
children I've had five kids go to
 
07:39:37.310 --> 07:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Londonderry schools two at Masters to a
 
07:39:40.010 --> 07:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
bachelor's one within the Marines okay
 
07:39:42.350 --> 07:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh the education was great but since
 
07:39:45.048 --> 07:39:45.058 align:start position:0%
covert now our education stuff is going
 
07:39:46.910 --> 07:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
down and down we're ruining our children
 
07:39:49.968 --> 07:39:49.978 align:start position:0%
and many people don't even care that all
 
07:39:52.310 --> 07:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
they care about is hey don't worry about
 
07:39:53.868 --> 07:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
it we'll we'll make up for it later on
 
07:39:56.628 --> 07:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay I got a kid right now my nephew On
 
07:39:59.030 --> 07:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
The Run okay with issues in school and
 
07:40:00.830 --> 07:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
other stuff he ran from his brother I
 
07:40:02.510 --> 07:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
mean from my brother that's going on
 
07:40:05.330 --> 07:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
right now tonight so I'm asking you to
 
07:40:08.810 --> 07:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
re think this this is our duty to fix
 
07:40:11.330 --> 07:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
this and make damn well assure their
 
07:40:14.570 --> 07:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
parents have a say I know firsthand
 
07:40:16.610 --> 07:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
about this because I was stationed in
 
07:40:18.530 --> 07:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
Delaware they were going to bust my kids
 
07:40:22.250 --> 07:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
into a bad school I moved to Aberdeen an
 
07:40:24.830 --> 07:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
hour and 15 minutes away so my kids
 
07:40:26.990 --> 07:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
could get a good education when they
 
07:40:29.810 --> 07:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
moved here to New Hampshire okay my kids
 
07:40:31.730 --> 07:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
were four or five months behind ahead
 
07:40:33.650 --> 07:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
they were so bored they wanted to go
 
07:40:34.968 --> 07:40:34.978 align:start position:0%
back to Maryland because New Hampshire
 
07:40:38.270 --> 07:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
schools were were so far slower than
 
07:40:39.708 --> 07:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
where they came from they went to
 
07:40:41.990 --> 07:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
military schools in Aberdeen so my kids
 
07:40:44.390 --> 07:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
were well educated but I'm just saying
 
07:40:46.070 --> 07:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
what my children went through when I
 
07:40:47.990 --> 07:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
moved them here after I retired from the
 
07:40:50.990 --> 07:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
Marines we owe it to the children we owe
 
07:40:53.330 --> 07:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
it to the parents I'm I'm telling you
 
07:40:55.610 --> 07:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
right now I'm involved I'm at these
 
07:40:57.590 --> 07:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee hearings that I'm watching and
 
07:41:00.170 --> 07:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
listening how these board members are
 
07:41:02.510 --> 07:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
speaking Republicans and Democrats so
 
07:41:04.788 --> 07:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's not just one party doing this the
 
07:41:06.830 --> 07:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
way they're treating these parents then
 
07:41:08.090 --> 07:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
you wonder why they're getting
 
07:41:11.030 --> 07:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
aggravated and it's a disgrace and there
 
07:41:12.410 --> 07:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
was a couple of notes that I made my
 
07:41:12.420 --> 07:41:13.788 align:start position:0%
was a couple of notes that I made my
here

07:41:13.788 --> 07:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:41:15.468 --> 07:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
I remember there was a movie that we
 
07:41:16.968 --> 07:41:16.978 align:start position:0%
once uh once watched it might have been
 
07:41:19.250 --> 07:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
a military one where they said there's a
 
07:41:21.530 --> 07:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
failure to communicate and that's what's
 
07:41:23.510 --> 07:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
going on right now the failure to
 
07:41:25.910 --> 07:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
communicate is through the parents in
 
07:41:27.850 --> 07:41:27.860 align:start position:0%
the school board School boards failure
 
07:41:30.890 --> 07:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
superintendents are too busy we have all
 
07:41:32.270 --> 07:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
these administrators we got more
 
07:41:34.128 --> 07:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
administrators today that I ever had
 
07:41:35.810 --> 07:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
when I was in school and that's where
 
07:41:38.030 --> 07:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
all that money's going okay right versus
 
07:41:40.968 --> 07:41:40.978 align:start position:0%
it should be going to the teachers
 
07:41:42.770 --> 07:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
07:41:44.510 --> 07:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
let me tell you I sat here and I
 
07:41:46.730 --> 07:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
listened to the union I I could never
 
07:41:50.448 --> 07:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
ever understand why taxpayers money are
 
07:41:52.310 --> 07:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
paying like a union guide was here today
 
07:41:54.948 --> 07:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
I respect them and God bless them but
 
07:41:57.170 --> 07:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money are paying these groups
 
07:41:59.510 --> 07:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
to go against the parents got to speak
 
07:42:01.610 --> 07:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
against the parents like up in here that
 
07:42:04.190 --> 07:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
makes no sense I don't know why
 
07:42:07.670 --> 07:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money a paying lobbyists
 
07:42:09.770 --> 07:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
something's wrong with this picture we
 
07:42:12.468 --> 07:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
should be protecting parents I thought
 
07:42:13.788 --> 07:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
there was a law somewhere around that
 
07:42:15.830 --> 07:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I may be wrong but that's all I have
 
07:42:18.110 --> 07:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
get back I am I'm getting back it was
 
07:42:20.628 --> 07:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
aggravating to see that but uh that's
 
07:42:22.368 --> 07:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
all I have and I I hope we do the right
 
07:42:24.468 --> 07:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
thing and protect the parents and the
 
07:42:25.910 --> 07:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
school board school boards need to be
 
07:42:28.788 --> 07:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
educated and understand that you have to
 
07:42:30.890 --> 07:42:30.900 align:start position:0%

07:43:35.030 --> 07:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it would also be prudent for
 
07:43:36.410 --> 07:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
this committee to know that the State
 
07:43:38.208 --> 07:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
Board of Education has not taken public
 
07:43:40.610 --> 07:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
comments for I believe the last year or
 
07:43:42.770 --> 07:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken
 
07:43:43.968 --> 07:43:43.978 align:start position:0%
um so
 
07:43:46.670 --> 07:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
um uh you know um if we were trying to
 
07:43:48.468 --> 07:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
set examples for local school boards we
 
07:43:49.968 --> 07:43:49.978 align:start position:0%
should start there and require State
 
07:43:51.650 --> 07:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to take public
 
07:43:54.410 --> 07:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
comments as well too
 
07:43:57.110 --> 07:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect I'm on uh the middle
 
07:43:59.350 --> 07:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
I guess on page I think it's page one
 
07:44:02.930 --> 07:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
line 16 where it talks about
 
07:44:04.368 --> 07:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
um an attendee made to man which New
 
07:44:05.750 --> 07:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute or administrator of
 
07:44:07.850 --> 07:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
rule gives a school board authority
 
07:44:09.708 --> 07:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
described in the school board policy
 
07:44:11.510 --> 07:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
that would mean that we can't have
 
07:44:13.730 --> 07:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
policies that relate to federal law if
 
07:44:16.250 --> 07:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're only limiting this to policies
 
07:44:18.190 --> 07:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
have to be based in New Hampshire law
 
07:44:20.208 --> 07:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
07:44:20.218 --> 07:44:21.128 align:start position:0%
it's also
um

07:44:21.128 --> 07:44:21.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:44:24.468 --> 07:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't make any sense and make
 
07:44:26.510 --> 07:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
any sense in the context of of a public
 
07:44:29.090 --> 07:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
body there's nothing in the law that
 
07:44:30.590 --> 07:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
speaks to a school board having a
 
07:44:32.390 --> 07:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
chairperson or electing officers does
 
07:44:33.770 --> 07:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
that mean they can't have a chairperson
 
07:44:36.230 --> 07:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
or elect officers I've got dozens of
 
07:44:39.708 --> 07:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
sample policies here that have no basis
 
07:44:41.930 --> 07:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
in particular statute or or or
 
07:44:45.010 --> 07:44:45.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rule
 
07:44:46.850 --> 07:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of instructional
 
07:44:48.830 --> 07:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
materials so we'll get rid of that
 
07:44:50.930 --> 07:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
policy and we won't reconsider our
 
07:44:52.850 --> 07:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
instructional materials
 
07:44:55.310 --> 07:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation of support staff there's
 
07:44:56.990 --> 07:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that requires support
 
07:44:58.968 --> 07:44:58.978 align:start position:0%
staff be evaluated
 
07:45:00.830 --> 07:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
tutoring for pay
 
07:45:02.990 --> 07:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that prohibits or
 
07:45:05.090 --> 07:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
specifically allows teachers to tutor
 
07:45:07.430 --> 07:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
students on their own time for pay I'm
 
07:45:08.628 --> 07:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
going to get to some of the more basic
 
07:45:11.510 --> 07:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
ones volunteer involvement School Board
 
07:45:12.770 --> 07:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
show encourage the involvement of
 
07:45:14.270 --> 07:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
citizens to fulfill the mission of the
 
07:45:16.190 --> 07:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
schools nothing in law that allows
 
07:45:18.288 --> 07:45:18.298 align:start position:0%
volunteers to come in the school
 
07:45:21.530 --> 07:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
district so we won't do that anymore
 
07:45:21.540 --> 07:45:22.490 align:start position:0%
district so we won't do that anymore
um

07:45:22.490 --> 07:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:24.890 --> 07:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
school board self-evaluation and goal
 
07:45:26.150 --> 07:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
setting there's goal setting there's
 
07:45:27.830 --> 07:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that requires or allows
 
07:45:31.730 --> 07:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:33.410 --> 07:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
roles and duties of the school board
 
07:45:35.090 --> 07:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
chairperson as I talked about there's
 
07:45:36.890 --> 07:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that specifically allows
 
07:45:38.448 --> 07:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
a school board to elect officers or
 
07:45:40.128 --> 07:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
appoint a chair so I don't know who's
 
07:45:42.590 --> 07:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to run the meeting
 
07:45:45.048 --> 07:45:45.058 align:start position:0%
board organizational meeting the board
 
07:45:46.610 --> 07:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
shall organize at its annual meeting
 
07:45:48.708 --> 07:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
annually at its first meeting follow the
 
07:45:50.390 --> 07:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
elections every member shall be notified
 
07:45:52.610 --> 07:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
of the meeting meeting shall be called
 
07:45:54.230 --> 07:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
to order by the superintendent who shall
 
07:45:56.208 --> 07:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
preside during the election of the
 
07:45:57.410 --> 07:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
chairperson there's nothing about
 
07:45:59.690 --> 07:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
election of officers and the law
 
07:46:02.810 --> 07:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
School Board officers
 
07:46:05.330 --> 07:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
agenda setting and preparation there's
 
07:46:07.250 --> 07:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
nothing in the law that requires a
 
07:46:10.430 --> 07:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
school board a set an agenda for a
 
07:46:11.868 --> 07:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
meeting so I guess setting an agenda
 
07:46:13.968 --> 07:46:13.978 align:start position:0%
would be illegal if this bill were to
 
07:46:13.978 --> 07:46:15.468 align:start position:0%
would be illegal if this bill were to
pass

07:46:15.468 --> 07:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
pass
 
07:46:18.350 --> 07:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
Rules of Order nothing in law relative
 
07:46:19.730 --> 07:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
to Rules of Order for school board
 
07:46:22.190 --> 07:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
meetings so that would be illegal
 
07:46:24.468 --> 07:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
approval of handbook handbooks and
 
07:46:26.090 --> 07:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
directives there's nothing in law that
 
07:46:28.128 --> 07:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
requires a school book create a handbook
 
07:46:31.670 --> 07:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
I guess we're publishing those illegally
 
07:46:33.890 --> 07:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
I think I made my point
 
07:46:35.868 --> 07:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
07:46:37.610 --> 07:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
07:46:40.610 --> 07:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
questions for Bear Christina
 
07:46:40.620 --> 07:46:43.850 align:start position:0%
questions for Bear Christina
yes

07:46:43.850 --> 07:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:46.548 --> 07:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
you tired huh I'm tired too
 
07:46:49.190 --> 07:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so here's my question
 
07:46:52.190 --> 07:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
I had always been trained over the I've
 
07:46:54.890 --> 07:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
been a chair seven out of nine years and
 
07:46:57.110 --> 07:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
I I actually allow public comment being
 
07:46:59.628 --> 07:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
at the end of the meeting because I feel
 
07:47:01.670 --> 07:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
very strongly we're going to address it
 
07:47:02.930 --> 07:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know I mean you need to have that
 
07:47:05.090 --> 07:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
chance but that being said
 
07:47:06.350 --> 07:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I had always been
 
07:47:08.810 --> 07:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
trained on was that school board meeting
 
07:47:11.048 --> 07:47:11.058 align:start position:0%
specific well any type of town meeting
 
07:47:15.948 --> 07:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
is a meeting held in public and not a
 
07:47:18.948 --> 07:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
public meeting therefore maybe public
 
07:47:21.410 --> 07:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
comment did not have to be allowed or
 
07:47:24.170 --> 07:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
the public cannot interrupt my question
 
07:47:25.670 --> 07:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
to you and I don't even know if it's
 
07:47:27.948 --> 07:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
really for you and I have to apologize
 
07:47:29.150 --> 07:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
because it's late and you're probably
 
07:47:32.090 --> 07:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
tired too like I said but um but I've
 
07:47:33.708 --> 07:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of pushback in the past
 
07:47:36.468 --> 07:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
year that that is actually not a that's
 
07:47:39.288 --> 07:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
not a correct mindset it's not a correct
 
07:47:41.030 --> 07:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
statement and I was wondering if you
 
07:47:43.788 --> 07:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
could please shed some light on that for
 
07:47:45.468 --> 07:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank you very much
 
07:47:47.208 --> 07:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
representative I mean it's a public
 
07:47:48.590 --> 07:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
meeting under the right to know
 
07:47:51.230 --> 07:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
obviously but at its most base level
 
07:47:53.150 --> 07:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's a business meeting of your regular
 
07:47:55.310 --> 07:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
school board meeting is a business of
 
07:47:56.810 --> 07:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
the school board where the Board needs
 
07:47:59.030 --> 07:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
to get its business done approved
 
07:48:02.330 --> 07:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
contracts receive reports adopt policies
 
07:48:04.190 --> 07:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
in your budget season while you're
 
07:48:05.810 --> 07:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully your budget's just about done
 
07:48:07.310 --> 07:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
you've got your budget hearing was
 
07:48:09.048 --> 07:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
probably this week if I'm not mistaken
 
07:48:13.570 --> 07:48:13.580 align:start position:0%
or yeah so um you know is public common
 
07:48:16.610 --> 07:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
period advisable absolutely nobody
 
07:48:19.010 --> 07:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
disputes that many boards do one at the
 
07:48:20.270 --> 07:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
beginning and one and after where they
 
07:48:22.010 --> 07:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
can comment on the agenda items or
 
07:48:23.208 --> 07:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen at that meeting
 
07:48:25.250 --> 07:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
and then at the conclusion of the
 
07:48:26.810 --> 07:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
meeting club members of the public can
 
07:48:28.610 --> 07:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
come back and talk about something that
 
07:48:30.410 --> 07:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
was discussed or a vote that happened or
 
07:48:32.150 --> 07:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it was during the course of
 
07:48:34.968 --> 07:48:34.978 align:start position:0%
that meeting that you know again if that
 
07:48:36.230 --> 07:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
works for your school board and that's
 
07:48:38.330 --> 07:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
what your community wants and I'd say go
 
07:48:40.430 --> 07:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and do that
 
07:48:43.310 --> 07:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so you know the responding to the
 
07:48:47.448 --> 07:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
questions and whatnot I mean you know
 
07:48:49.730 --> 07:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
you know is the question being prose as
 
07:48:51.468 --> 07:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
a legitimate question or is it you know
 
07:48:53.810 --> 07:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
being posed as a way to take a swipe at
 
07:48:55.910 --> 07:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
a school board or a superintendent or
 
07:48:58.250 --> 07:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be you know of
 
07:49:00.650 --> 07:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
course on hsba Advocates that that we
 
07:49:02.448 --> 07:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
should have public comments the
 
07:49:04.910 --> 07:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
parameters of of what we do with public
 
07:49:07.368 --> 07:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
comments that's a First Amendment matter
 
07:49:10.070 --> 07:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you could spend a a three-day
 
07:49:13.788 --> 07:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
seminar doing you can go from open-ended
 
07:49:15.530 --> 07:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
public comment come and say what you
 
07:49:17.930 --> 07:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
want to you know very restrictive two
 
07:49:19.490 --> 07:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
minutes per person only talk about these
 
07:49:21.230 --> 07:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
topics so on and so forth there's a lot
 
07:49:23.270 --> 07:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
of play in the middle and you know my
 
07:49:25.368 --> 07:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
experience is a lot of school boards do
 
07:49:27.230 --> 07:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
it differently yes we have a sample
 
07:49:29.270 --> 07:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
policy I can probably we probably got 10
 
07:49:30.948 --> 07:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
on file though
 
07:49:32.690 --> 07:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
um we've also just to make it clear as
 
07:49:35.388 --> 07:49:35.398 align:start position:0%
well too when school boards were facing
 
07:49:37.010 --> 07:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
the issues last summer and fall
 
07:49:39.230 --> 07:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
specifically over the masks and whether
 
07:49:40.310 --> 07:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
or not they were going to do in person
 
07:49:42.650 --> 07:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
and and or remote
 
07:49:44.388 --> 07:49:44.398 align:start position:0%
you know we tried to counsel school
 
07:49:46.730 --> 07:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
boards we said look don't put the mask
 
07:49:50.270 --> 07:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
issue on when you've got 6 000 other
 
07:49:52.190 --> 07:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
things to do at your board meeting if
 
07:49:54.230 --> 07:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
you got 300 people showing up at your
 
07:49:55.968 --> 07:49:55.978 align:start position:0%
board meeting and they're angry about
 
07:49:58.010 --> 07:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
whatever decision you're making maybe
 
07:49:59.690 --> 07:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
hold a second maybe hold a separate
 
07:50:01.070 --> 07:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
meeting all right we're gonna spend two
 
07:50:02.330 --> 07:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
hours tonight and we're only going to
 
07:50:04.250 --> 07:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
talk about masks if you want to come and
 
07:50:06.230 --> 07:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
tell us your opinion on mask we're going
 
07:50:07.670 --> 07:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
to do it we're gonna do it outside of
 
07:50:09.048 --> 07:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
the meeting where we've got to approve
 
07:50:11.090 --> 07:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
the contracts and adopt the policies and
 
07:50:12.650 --> 07:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's an extra meeting we talked about
 
07:50:14.750 --> 07:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
how many more times but that's one other
 
07:50:17.030 --> 07:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
way to sort of you know let the public
 
07:50:19.368 --> 07:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
have their voice um you know a public I
 
07:50:20.570 --> 07:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to call it a hearing per se
 
07:50:22.968 --> 07:50:22.978 align:start position:0%
but almost a public forum about this
 
07:50:24.948 --> 07:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
particular Topic in person versus remote
 
07:50:27.468 --> 07:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
Mass versus no Mass you know sometimes
 
07:50:28.788 --> 07:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
you have the same way that we have
 
07:50:30.288 --> 07:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
separate budget hearings to talk about
 
07:50:31.968 --> 07:50:31.978 align:start position:0%
only the budget we're only talking about
 
07:50:34.010 --> 07:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
the budget tonight let's only talk about
 
07:50:35.628 --> 07:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
masks tonight let's only talk about
 
07:50:38.990 --> 07:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
in-person versus virtual tonight some
 
07:50:40.788 --> 07:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
boards were able to do that some words
 
07:50:43.910 --> 07:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:46.730 --> 07:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
hope that helps

thank you very much for giving me this
 
07:51:38.448 --> 07:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
time to speak with you my name is Lori
 
07:51:41.270 --> 07:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
ortolano and I'm from Nashua it's been a
 
07:51:43.128 --> 07:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
long time since I've addressed an
 
07:51:46.610 --> 07:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
education issue or been gotten involved
 
07:51:48.830 --> 07:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I live I'm the vice president of
 
07:51:51.048 --> 07:51:51.058 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire and we're
 
07:51:53.208 --> 07:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
supporting this legislation
 
07:51:55.310 --> 07:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
to enhance public comment at school
 
07:51:56.810 --> 07:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
07:51:59.510 --> 07:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
25 years ago I served on the Litchfield
 
07:52:01.430 --> 07:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
07:52:03.830 --> 07:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
um for about five years and that was a
 
07:52:05.930 --> 07:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
different time in a different place
 
07:52:07.730 --> 07:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to witness the
 
07:52:09.708 --> 07:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
argumentative dialogue between school
 
07:52:11.330 --> 07:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
boards and parents and read the
 
07:52:13.310 --> 07:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
contentious articles about parents
 
07:52:16.368 --> 07:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
teachers children in schools the Nashua
 
07:52:18.410 --> 07:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
School Board has become a hotbed of
 
07:52:20.868 --> 07:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
issues in Parental frustration is high
 
07:52:23.030 --> 07:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
and understandable
 
07:52:25.310 --> 07:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
the language of this legislation does
 
07:52:28.430 --> 07:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
not impact RSA 91a but it does hold
 
07:52:30.770 --> 07:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
elected school board members to a higher
 
07:52:32.810 --> 07:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
degree of accountability to respond to
 
07:52:34.368 --> 07:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
community questions
 
07:52:36.110 --> 07:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
there are many important curriculum
 
07:52:37.788 --> 07:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
issues today and parents have questions
 
07:52:39.888 --> 07:52:39.898 align:start position:0%
regarding the administrative rules used
 
07:52:42.350 --> 07:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
to create policy and procedure they
 
07:52:44.030 --> 07:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
cannot question what rules or
 
07:52:46.430 --> 07:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
regulations apply because this Falls
 
07:52:49.430 --> 07:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of 91a and a records
 
07:52:52.430 --> 07:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
request some elected boards will respond
 
07:52:54.288 --> 07:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
to questions and we'll get answers to
 
07:52:55.610 --> 07:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
those who ask
 
07:52:57.888 --> 07:52:57.898 align:start position:0%
school boards are shutting down or being
 
07:52:59.690 --> 07:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
advised to do so
 
07:53:01.968 --> 07:53:01.978 align:start position:0%
and the result is we're building walls
 
07:53:03.650 --> 07:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
and not Bridges
 
07:53:05.570 --> 07:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
this public input legislation
 
07:53:07.490 --> 07:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
specifically for school boards will
 
07:53:09.888 --> 07:53:09.898 align:start position:0%
benefit all schools in the state the
 
07:53:13.810 --> 07:53:13.820 align:start position:0%
sdga has requested one public question
 
07:53:17.208 --> 07:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
comment question period for this new
 
07:53:19.548 --> 07:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
legislation but we would like to see two
 
07:53:21.170 --> 07:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
public common question and answer
 
07:53:23.990 --> 07:53:24.000 align:start position:0%

07:53:37.070 --> 07:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
submitted that you received in an email
 
07:53:39.110 --> 07:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
was that they would
 
07:53:42.350 --> 07:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
um there would be one designated period
 
07:53:45.530 --> 07:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
um for interactive questions and answers
 
07:53:47.388 --> 07:53:47.398 align:start position:0%
um the public would have to be allowed

end
 
07:54:19.788 --> 07:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
um when it talks about members of the
 
07:54:21.830 --> 07:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
public assembling to meet so long as the
 
07:54:23.270 --> 07:54:23.280 align:start position:0%

07:54:26.110 --> 07:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure under RSA 91a or other
 
07:54:29.990 --> 07:54:30.000 align:start position:0%

answer a question or provide an
 
07:54:35.990 --> 07:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that the school
 
07:54:37.788 --> 07:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
board would have five business days to
 
07:54:40.430 --> 07:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
respond just like they would under RSA
 
07:54:44.208 --> 07:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
91a and if they don't have a citation or
 
07:54:46.730 --> 07:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
a policy with which they are operating
 
07:54:49.730 --> 07:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
under they would address that at the
 
07:54:52.128 --> 07:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
next school board meeting and provision
 
07:54:52.138 --> 07:54:54.770 align:start position:0%
next school board meeting and provision
four

07:54:54.770 --> 07:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:54.780 --> 07:54:55.968 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:54:55.968 --> 07:54:55.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:54:58.190 --> 07:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
additional additionally members of the
 
07:55:00.048 --> 07:55:00.058 align:start position:0%
public may also file a request pursuant
 
07:55:02.208 --> 07:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
to the right to no law under RSA 91a
 
07:55:04.190 --> 07:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
colon 4 to the school board to obtain
 
07:55:06.888 --> 07:55:06.898 align:start position:0%
documents relative to questions right so
 
07:55:09.770 --> 07:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's just a document and so those that's
 
07:55:12.170 --> 07:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
the substitutive changes that were made
 
07:55:13.968 --> 07:55:13.978 align:start position:0%
by the school district's governing
 
07:55:17.208 --> 07:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
Association that supported by um right
 
07:55:19.910 --> 07:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
to know and I just wanted to add a
 
07:55:21.830 --> 07:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
couple thoughts to what I listened to
 
07:55:25.250 --> 07:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
here some comments the it looks like the
 
07:55:27.230 --> 07:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
School Board Association gave guidance
 
07:55:29.690 --> 07:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
to cities or towns you know on how to
 
07:55:31.730 --> 07:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
deal with public input and when you have
 
07:55:34.190 --> 07:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
a contentious issue like masks maybe
 
07:55:36.230 --> 07:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't take it on when you have 20 items
 
07:55:38.388 --> 07:55:38.398 align:start position:0%
on the agenda you know what happened in
 
07:55:41.330 --> 07:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
Nashua is the mask issue got put on the
 
07:55:44.090 --> 07:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
agenda right at the meeting and public
 
07:55:46.250 --> 07:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
input was shut down there was no input
 
07:55:48.590 --> 07:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
allowed I can tell you that was a bad
 
07:55:50.868 --> 07:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
move I wasn't at that meeting I've never
 
07:55:52.610 --> 07:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually gone to a school board meeting
 
07:55:55.310 --> 07:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
in Nashua I've watched them on TV I was
 
07:55:56.990 --> 07:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to go to the last one and it was
 
07:55:59.930 --> 07:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
80 people out there and I decided to go
 
07:56:02.990 --> 07:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
home I drove and turned around and left
 
07:56:05.990 --> 07:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
um because it was a heated meeting again
 
07:56:06.000 --> 07:56:07.250 align:start position:0%
um because it was a heated meeting again
but

07:56:07.250 --> 07:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:56:09.590 --> 07:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the actions of the board in
 
07:56:12.170 --> 07:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
Nashua to Simply cancel public comment
 
07:56:14.750 --> 07:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
and not even have the mask item on the
 
07:56:16.910 --> 07:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
agenda just put it on live in the
 
07:56:19.490 --> 07:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
meeting vote on it and not allow open
 
07:56:21.770 --> 07:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
comment that's a disaster
 
07:56:24.530 --> 07:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
when I see that happening and it just
 
07:56:27.288 --> 07:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of hardship
 
07:56:29.930 --> 07:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I also heard um the association talk
 
07:56:31.788 --> 07:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
about you know what school boards have
 
07:56:33.590 --> 07:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
to endure and I was a school board
 
07:56:33.600 --> 07:56:34.910 align:start position:0%
to endure and I was a school board
member

07:56:34.910 --> 07:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
member
 
07:56:34.920 --> 07:56:36.110 align:start position:0%
member
um

07:56:36.110 --> 07:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:38.448 --> 07:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
and and social media wasn't around when
 
07:56:40.368 --> 07:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
I was a school board member thankfully
 
07:56:43.430 --> 07:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it is now and it's you know social
 
07:56:45.590 --> 07:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
media is is the opposite of prayer
 
07:56:47.388 --> 07:56:47.398 align:start position:0%
that's for sure there's not much good
 
07:56:50.570 --> 07:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
going on on social media so
 
07:56:54.048 --> 07:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
you know you have to
 
07:56:55.968 --> 07:56:55.978 align:start position:0%
either tune that out
 
07:56:57.830 --> 07:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know tune it out it doesn't matter
 
07:56:59.388 --> 07:56:59.398 align:start position:0%
it's everyone can have their own
 
07:57:00.888 --> 07:57:00.898 align:start position:0%
platform to throw whatever they want
 
07:57:03.288 --> 07:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
around ignore it
 
07:57:05.030 --> 07:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
um but I have to say and there are
 
07:57:06.590 --> 07:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
parents that put things up on social
 
07:57:08.868 --> 07:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
media that's frankly just horrendous and
 
07:57:11.208 --> 07:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
citizens horrendous things being posted
 
07:57:14.270 --> 07:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
but I have to tell you my take in Nashua
 
07:57:16.730 --> 07:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
is I have seen school board and elected
 
07:57:18.590 --> 07:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
officials post things that were just
 
07:57:22.670 --> 07:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
outrageous it's both ways and what's and
 
07:57:24.230 --> 07:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's more concerning to me when it's
 
07:57:26.388 --> 07:57:26.398 align:start position:0%
coming from elected officials honestly
 
07:57:29.388 --> 07:57:29.398 align:start position:0%
the standard has to be higher you have
 
07:57:31.548 --> 07:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
to avoid that and I think there ought to
 
07:57:33.288 --> 07:57:33.298 align:start position:0%
be policies established on the use of
 
07:57:35.388 --> 07:57:35.398 align:start position:0%
social media by elected officials just
 
07:57:38.090 --> 07:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
like companies establish those policies
 
07:57:40.730 --> 07:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
because I I had heard a few things about
 
07:57:42.948 --> 07:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
some board members never tracked it
 
07:57:46.128 --> 07:57:46.138 align:start position:0%
maybe two months ago I happened to
 
07:57:48.830 --> 07:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
somebody directed me and emailed me a
 
07:57:50.930 --> 07:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
copy of what was posted on social media
 
07:57:53.510 --> 07:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
I was flabbergasted that that was an
 
07:57:56.930 --> 07:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
elected official well okay that'll cause
 
07:57:58.490 --> 07:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems
 
07:58:01.850 --> 07:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm I'm very sympathetic
 
07:58:04.310 --> 07:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
about the needs of parents
 
07:58:06.830 --> 07:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I homeschooled my kids I was
 
07:58:08.270 --> 07:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
a school board member for five years and
 
07:58:09.948 --> 07:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
I homeschooled my kids
 
07:58:11.570 --> 07:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and I always felt like I served the
 
07:58:14.628 --> 07:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
interest of my citizens and towns
 
07:58:16.788 --> 07:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
completely it was never about my agenda
 
07:58:19.850 --> 07:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
at all and I never professed my choice
 
07:58:23.330 --> 07:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
to anyone or um you know it was all
 
07:58:26.208 --> 07:58:26.218 align:start position:0%
about building a good school system
 
07:58:26.218 --> 07:58:27.770 align:start position:0%
about building a good school system
um

07:58:27.770 --> 07:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:29.990 --> 07:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
in it
 
07:58:32.750 --> 07:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
things are very difficult right now and
 
07:58:35.150 --> 07:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
I always say you know sometimes it's got
 
07:58:36.888 --> 07:58:36.898 align:start position:0%
to get worse before it gets better you
 
07:58:39.468 --> 07:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
just gotta let it go but I'm concerned
 
07:58:41.270 --> 07:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
about that when it comes to schools and
 
07:58:43.788 --> 07:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
education because every last year is a
 
07:58:46.850 --> 07:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
lost year on a child and you know if it
 
07:58:48.410 --> 07:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
takes three or four more years of
 
07:58:50.810 --> 07:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
fighting and and you let that go or
 
07:58:53.330 --> 07:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
another three-year election cycle you
 
07:58:55.628 --> 07:58:55.638 align:start position:0%
just you lose a lot of quality education
 
07:58:58.610 --> 07:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
and you and Nash was lost 10 percent of
 
07:59:01.010 --> 07:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
its population virtually and I will tell
 
07:59:02.930 --> 07:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
you I really believe if they had three
 
07:59:05.208 --> 07:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
more private schools that opened up
 
07:59:07.788 --> 07:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools they would be filled
 
07:59:09.968 --> 07:59:09.978 align:start position:0%
because they're brimming right now
 
07:59:13.190 --> 07:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
parents are looking for choices big time
 
07:59:16.490 --> 07:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
and um I love the idea of holding
 
07:59:18.650 --> 07:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
hearings or just I actually wrote an
 
07:59:21.048 --> 07:59:21.058 align:start position:0%
email last night and said it would be a
 
07:59:22.670 --> 07:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
gesture of Goodwill for the board of
 
07:59:25.010 --> 07:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
aldermen to hold once a year an open
 
07:59:27.350 --> 07:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
meeting for the public to come and ask
 
07:59:29.628 --> 07:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions and just talk to you just
 
07:59:31.190 --> 07:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't want one meeting and I would
 
07:59:33.410 --> 07:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
recommend the school board do too
 
07:59:35.448 --> 07:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
because the school board really needs
 
07:59:38.530 --> 07:59:38.540 align:start position:0%
that just have an open Forum come on out
 
07:59:41.388 --> 07:59:41.398 align:start position:0%
it's a great gesture of Goodwill I did
 
07:59:43.250 --> 07:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
it up at the assessing standards boards
 
07:59:45.110 --> 07:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
therebylaws require that it be done up
 
07:59:46.968 --> 07:59:46.978 align:start position:0%
in Concord and they actually held it in
 
07:59:48.410 --> 07:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester I went to that a few months
 
07:59:51.288 --> 07:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
ago there are only three people there
 
07:59:53.030 --> 07:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so it wasn't a killer for them but
 
07:59:54.770 --> 07:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's a great gesture of Goodwill and I
 
07:59:57.288 --> 07:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
got four or five questions answered so I
 
07:59:59.990 --> 08:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
loved going and getting my answers you
 
08:00:02.628 --> 08:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
know in document requests under 91a and
 
08:00:04.310 --> 08:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
the way 91a is written it's about
 
08:00:07.070 --> 08:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
records and documents terrific I
 
08:00:09.830 --> 08:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
understand all of that but sometimes you
 
08:00:11.690 --> 08:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
have to be able to ask questions to
 
08:00:14.150 --> 08:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
understand what documents you want you
 
08:00:16.190 --> 08:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
have to have a basic understanding to
 
08:00:18.468 --> 08:00:18.478 align:start position:0%
know how to go after the documents
 
08:00:22.070 --> 08:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
and depending on how contentious it is
 
08:00:24.830 --> 08:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
they those walls can exist in
 
08:00:27.410 --> 08:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
communities where just having a basic
 
08:00:29.990 --> 08:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand communication on how the
 
08:00:33.048 --> 08:00:33.058 align:start position:0%
records exist isn't happening because
 
08:00:35.150 --> 08:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
you can't ask a question
 
08:00:39.888 --> 08:00:39.898 align:start position:0%
so with that becomes very very tricky so
 
08:00:42.410 --> 08:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know I don't
 
08:00:45.530 --> 08:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
I don't envy your position and and the
 
08:00:46.968 --> 08:00:46.978 align:start position:0%
decisions and what you're looking at
 
08:00:50.208 --> 08:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
here and um I hope and pray for better
 
08:00:52.368 --> 08:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
scenarios in our state when it comes to
 
08:00:53.810 --> 08:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
education and all that we've gone
 
08:00:57.770 --> 08:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
through but in general our right to know
 
08:01:00.288 --> 08:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire committee and the sdga
 
08:01:03.350 --> 08:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
stand behind putting more information in
 
08:01:05.388 --> 08:01:05.398 align:start position:0%
the hands of parents and if it's through
 
08:01:05.398 --> 08:01:06.708 align:start position:0%
the hands of parents and if it's through
questions

08:01:06.708 --> 08:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:01:09.590 --> 08:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so be it thank you thank you very
 
08:01:11.448 --> 08:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony are there any
 
08:01:11.458 --> 08:01:13.570 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony are there any
questions

08:01:13.570 --> 08:01:13.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:01:18.230 --> 08:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:20.930 --> 08:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:22.548 --> 08:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
go ahead it's been 25 years since we've
 
08:01:25.190 --> 08:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
had fun on the budget committee I know I
 
08:01:26.570 --> 08:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
did the budget committee after the
 
08:01:29.030 --> 08:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
school board with representative Baum
 
08:01:31.548 --> 08:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
for a few years of that yes
 
08:01:31.558 --> 08:01:33.230 align:start position:0%
for a few years of that yes
yep

08:01:33.230 --> 08:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
yep
 
08:01:36.110 --> 08:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
that was your question
 
08:01:38.388 --> 08:01:38.398 align:start position:0%
thank you I should have put the gamble
 
08:01:38.398 --> 08:01:41.090 align:start position:0%
thank you I should have put the gamble
down

08:01:41.090 --> 08:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:43.070 --> 08:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
08:01:46.430 --> 08:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have one left uh
 
08:01:50.690 --> 08:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:56.990 --> 08:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:59.330 --> 08:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
hello this is uh Eric power I'm here for
 
08:02:00.468 --> 08:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
the school district governance
 
08:02:02.750 --> 08:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
Association that was just alluded to and
 
08:02:04.070 --> 08:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep it brief because you
 
08:02:06.410 --> 08:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
heard most of what we talked about I did
 
08:02:08.208 --> 08:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
email to the committee the school
 
08:02:09.770 --> 08:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
district governance association's
 
08:02:12.770 --> 08:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
recommended amendments the sdga is very
 
08:02:14.570 --> 08:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
much in favor of this bill for all the
 
08:02:16.670 --> 08:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
reasons that were stated it's a very
 
08:02:19.788 --> 08:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
important bill it will help a lot some
 
08:02:22.190 --> 08:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
some school boards are doing this as a
 
08:02:24.410 --> 08:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
good practice but there's others that
 
08:02:26.868 --> 08:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
aren't doing it at all and so by putting
 
08:02:29.090 --> 08:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
it into law I think you can see the need
 
08:02:31.430 --> 08:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
for it it complements the previous bill
 
08:02:33.708 --> 08:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
that was put up here and I would ask
 
08:02:35.690 --> 08:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
that you could the the Amendments that
 
08:02:37.250 --> 08:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
we put in are a little more prescriptive
 
08:02:38.930 --> 08:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
you can decide whether to use them or
