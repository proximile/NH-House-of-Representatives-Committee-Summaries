Whitley thank you madam chair and good
 
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee for the
 
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
record my name is Becky Whitley see if I
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
can see everyone here uh and I'm honored
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
to serve Senate District 15 which
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
includes the wonderful communities of Bo
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
ConEd Penacook and hopkington uh today
 
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm honored to introduce Senate Bill 337
 
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
which contains some technical portions
 
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 align:start position:0%
from the momus bill last year Senate
 
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 175 that were just inadvertently
 
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
left out of hb2 last year so if you
 
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
remember um or you may not sort of know
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
the full procedure of what happened with
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
the mnus S SP 175 last year as the
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
Senate's practice okay so Senate Bill
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
175 was introduced last year with strong
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support it was a
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill to address maternal
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
health and um a portion of that bill was
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
to add Doula coverage and lactation
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
coverage uh lactation service coverage
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and other things to the Medicaid
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
Program and for those folks those
 
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 align:start position:0%
providers to actually build Medicaid we
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
had to have a process through oplc um
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
for those folks to get certified that's
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
just the way that our Medicaid uh
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
program works we we add the service and
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
then you have to make sure that the
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
providers are certified so we said to
 
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
doulas and lactation service providers
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to be certified to
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire but if you
 
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
want to build Medicaid you do have to go
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
through oplc because that is just our
 
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
process and Henry Litman or someone else
 
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
from the Department can sort of describe
 
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
that so what you see in 337 was just
 
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
sort of those that technical piece to
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
add to give oplc authority to do that
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
but in the hustle and bustle the Senate
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
passed Senate Bill 175 and as is our
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
practice we tabled the bill for
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the budget into hb2
 
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
everything got included except for this
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
little technical piece that was left out
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
inadvertently um and apologies to the
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
house for that um Medicaid director
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman had elevated this issue to
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
me at the beginning of or at the end of
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
last year and we're just here today to
 
00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
make that technical fix um so again as
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
we worked out last year we don't want a
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for all duas and lactation
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh service providers it's only for those
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
who want to participate in the medical
 
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid Program so um an
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendment was emailed to the committee
 
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
and I do have copies and um all the
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
amendment does was is actually just
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
removes credent like names of
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
credentials for lactation service
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
providers so you will see so duelas and
 
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
lactation service providers there's a
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
whole host of credentials different
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
bodies that credential them and on the
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
Doula side we didn't think it was
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate to pick that in the statute
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
one credential over the other that was a
 
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
process that was more appropriate in
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
oplc and with the Medicaid Program so we
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
inadvertently did that on the lactation
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
service side so you'll see that this
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
amendment just removes mention of actual
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
credentials right and so it just says
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
that oplc shall determine the
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
certification if that makes sense um I
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
have copies here and I'm happy to take
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
any questions um would the chair like me
 
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
to pass out the amendment it will help
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
us a lot uh I have a question you can
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
think about while you're passing them
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
out we have gotten a great number of
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
communications from people who are
 
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
apparently in other organizations that
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
certify lactation consultants and your
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is designed to say any of the
 
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
professional groups that do certify
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
lactation Consultants are fine with us
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so we're just taking mention out in
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
the statute that we don't think it's
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to like just list two of the
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
credentials in the statute we think
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's more appropriate in the Medicaid
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
Program and the administrative process
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for the statute so yes
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of the uh
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
correspondence that you've received is
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
very valid we should never have put it
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
was actually uh something that we should
 
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
never have put in in the first place
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
it's really not appropriate for a
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
statute to to name various credentials
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
well actually many of our licensing
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
statutes do name the credentialing
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
organizations which is why we weren't
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
surprised to see it here okay okay but
 
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.909 align:start position:0%
surprised to see it here okay okay but
this

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
eliminates the conflict between the two
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
different groups that offer slightly
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
different but adequate
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
credentials yes so it all it does is
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
authorize oplc to determine the
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
process okay Y and work with the various
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
credentialing bodies and that will
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
happen through
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
rules all right are there any other
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative leus uh thank
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
you I'm not sure if there might be
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else here better able to answer
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
this but I'd like to have some feel for
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody from
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
oplc on what sorts of things uh they
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
would expect to put in rules around the
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
certification um I don't I'm not sure
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody from oplc just at the
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
moment yeah and I would suggest we are
 
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
expecting them later in because they're
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
the next Bill's all about them so ah
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
wait a second we will as as soon as uh
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
when please put in a card and when we uh
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
get to you we'll we'll ask that question
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
um and Madam chair if I may um the I
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
would also suggest calling up um Lisa s
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department who um is also not
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
put in a card so so I would suggest yeah
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
hearing from her because she's really
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
the expert in this field I am not the
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
expert she's the public health person um
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
who is working with the Medicaid
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
department on these various credentials
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
she's also a lactation service provider
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
herself so she might be the next person
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
to speak with along with with OP PLC
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%

thank you I'm Brenda golden H the agency
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
council with oplc um I don't oplc um
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a position on the bill um I
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have any answers to any
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody might have but I
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be um sure to take them along and
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that any questions get
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
answered in terms of um how we would
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
process this all right represent laus
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I I know the uh the details on
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement certification would go
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
through the whole room making process
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
but I was wondering if there's you know
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
some feel for the sorts of requirements
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
um that oplc would expect to uh to put
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
in place I do not at this time and um it
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
was uh kind of a surprised to me that an
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
amendment had been um had been submitted
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
today so I think that um once we have a
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
chance to absorb uh the removal of the
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing agencies and how we would
 
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh how we would then credential the
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
people would might be a better answer
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
but I could certainly um have somebody
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
address that for you and um see if we
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
can get a more thorough answer all right
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and um we've got a
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
couple of professional organizations
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
that will no doubt tell you how uh
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate their certifications are
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:06.190 align:start position:0%

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
you need turn the mic on there you go
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lisa sorice I
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
work in the New Hampshire division of
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services for the
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
Department um there is not a
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative here from Medicaid this
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
morning but I can help answer some
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions um thank you to Senator
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
Whitley for bringing forward um this
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
legislation it is because of Medicaid
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that certification um
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
needs to happen for both douas and
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
lactation service providers there is
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity currently under Medicaid for
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
lactation services to be provided under
 
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
currently licensed professionals right
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
now such as Healthcare Providers or
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
nursing the intent of this legislation
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
was to allow for those beneficiaries of
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to seek lactation service
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
support through
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid outside of just their immediate
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
primary care provider so such as with an
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
international board certified lactation
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
consultant it was brought forward in the
 
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.430 align:start position:0%
consultant it was brought forward in the
other

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
chamber that there are other
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing agencies that certify
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
other lactation education providers and
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
so it started to get a little confusing
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
between the difference between
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing bodies in lactation
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
service providers there is one clinical
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
lactation service professional that
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
exists and that's an international board
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
certified lactation consultant those are
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
your folks who typically are working
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
inside the hospitals providing immediate
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
lactation care for moms Post delivery
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
there are also some that work in private
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
practice or work in pediatric offices
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
that are really servicing those families
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that have complex lactation issues
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
beyond your basic need of typically what
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
can be solved in your provider's office
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
there is another group of like ation
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
service providers which fall under our
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
educational arm if you will and those
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
folks are working inside of our Wick
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
programs also inside of some doctor's
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
offices home visiting programs providing
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
basic breastfeeding management and
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
education to families and so the the
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
information that was put forth in the
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendment of removing the credentialing
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
agencies is because there are a lot of
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing agencies that oversee our
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
lactation Educators there is only one
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
that oversees International board
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
certified lactation Consultants but
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
rather than um in statute we are willing
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the department to work with oplc
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
obviously within Medicaid um to identify
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
what those credentialing agencies are to
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that lactation services are
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
available for Medicaid
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
moms so so if I understand you correctly
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
the group you mentioned is for
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
essentially working within hospitals and
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
for immediate Pro and severe problems
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
with nursing yes and the other
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
credentials are for out in the community
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
with Education and Training and help
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
with less s less serious medical issues
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
primarily yes okay thank you I I think
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
that makes sense other
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
questions representative
shu

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
shu
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair U Can you tell us
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
are there major impediments to folks
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
that are working in these other fields
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
certification I don't know about
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
impediments but it's certainly a longer
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
process um to become an international
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
board certified lactation folks that are
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
ibc's which is the term that we use in
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare um have professional
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
secondary education in a health
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
discipline they then have on-site
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
clinical experience that is
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
required um and then they sit for a exam
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
it is the same exam that is taken
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
globally um so this credential is
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
recognized even outside of the United
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
States um whereas um some of our other
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
lactation educator
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
credentials um tends to be more of an
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
online course that doesn't require
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
secondary education first although some
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
may um and so it's just the depth of the
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
clinical lactation that they engage in
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
is is not the
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
same okay represent leus thank you so is
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
the Medicare requirement just that they
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
have state
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
certification or does it have further
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
requirements that would U constrain what
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
oplc would have to choose for as the
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
requirements it is just for state
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
certification okay thank you okay so
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
certify We could decide to certify
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
anybody on any
 
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.829 align:start position:0%
anybody on any
ground

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate I don't necessarily know
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
exactly the answer to that not working
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah okay yeah so I was talking
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
about the original Bill I'm I'm going to
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
address the um Amendment the original
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
spe specifies that the uh the
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
lactation service providers are
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
credentials by the international board
 
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.549 align:start position:0%
credentials by the international board
right

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
period so they must be and there's no
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
other opportunity for certification in
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
the bill as written but but the CLC was
 
00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:01.390 align:start position:0%
the bill as written but but the CLC was
named

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
named
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
specifically right I in the Senate
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
version yes right am I miss missing
 
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
version yes right am I miss missing
something

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
Senator no okay you're I'm a little
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
confused may I maner yeah yes please um
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
I understand this this has been a lot of
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
back and forth the bill as introduced
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
only had the ic's the Senate Edna
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
committee amended it to add the clc's my
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment removes any
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
reference to various different
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
credentials because you know we didn't
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
think it was appropriate at this point
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
to make those choices in the statute and
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
that that was more appropriate at the
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
administrative Lev well that's
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
interesting because the version we have
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
is the ver version as introduced not as
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
Senate so we don't know what you're
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
talking about okay I sorry about that um
 
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
I hope that clears up some
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
represent to try and clarify so did the
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
Senate as a whole adopt that Edna Eda
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment they did and I think it we it
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
was before we really had that rigorous
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
conversation about all the different
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
credentials that were on the table and
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why this amendment has come in
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
today because the you know folks you
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
know it's it's more appropriate to have
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
that at the administrative I was just
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if we actually had the wrong
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
version it appears we did no no a matter
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
of fact it looks like there was a screw
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
up in the Senate because the committee
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
recommended ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
it went to F oh yes and then Finance set
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so we want to have the
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
version as amended by the Senate which
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
is not what we
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
have okay and yes it
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
does um they're looking at a different
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill this National commission for
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
certifying agencies
 
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:06.789 align:start position:0%
certifying agencies
Etc

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
but what's
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
that yes please we need to know what
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so it replaces the entire first
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
section yeah so so the just
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
a I'm I I'm sorry for the confusion it
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
has been a very confusing process but my
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
understanding so I introduced the bill
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
we just had reference to the ic's
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
because that was the original version in
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
the mnus last year and then the Senate
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
Edna amended it included mention of the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
additional credential and then there
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of and the Senate
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
adopted that and then there have been a
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations since which is why
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
as I'm introducing it we are removing
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
reference to specific credentials
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
because it's more appropriate at this
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
point because of so many credentials
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
that are on the table for that to be
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
done uh within oplc and DHHS and leis I
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
can have more info about that and
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
so so Miss Kelly your position is that
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
you do not accept the uh National
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
commission for certifying agency
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
certification no it's the other
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
one American National standards
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
Institute it's not that we don't accept
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
that credentialing agency it's just that
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
credentialing agency only oversees one
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
lactation educator provider there are
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
lots of lactation educator providers
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
that are overseen by different
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
credentialing agencies and so the bill
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
names two credentialing
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
agencies so to put in statute two
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing agencies when there are
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
other ones felt not right okay so yes
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Kelly if you could if you
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
could please explain the the issue to us
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure so it has so we're talking about
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
about the ibclc and the CLC
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing so we object to the um we
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
we we support the role of the CLC but
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of breastfeeding
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
education which is not require
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
certification and so the CLC should not
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
be um certified to independently
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
practice or submit from for
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from Medicaid for the foll
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
reasons okay clc's take a 52-hour course
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
which is online only and requires no
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
prerequisite health degree uh they are
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
not trained to handle complex feeding
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
situations such as infant suck swallow
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
abnormalities or infant failure to
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
thrive um clc's currently do work in
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
Wick clinics covering all 10 New
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire counties and provide basic
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding education at no cost to
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the state so allowing for reimbursement
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid is a duplication of
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
services and could impact the ability of
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
those clinics to keep the staff so what
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
do you mean by at no cost to the state
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
there um those um services are provided
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
in wi clinics using 100% federal dollars
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
so they exist that particular credential
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
does exist and work in wi clinics
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
already and lastly related to the C CL
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
ibclc versus CLC um credential there is
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
a potential conflict of interests to
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
include one breastfeeding educator
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
credentialing agency when there are many
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
options available for that type and
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's what Lisa was talking about okay
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh so the healthy children's project
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
Academy of lactation policy and practice
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
has trademarked that credential when
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are other options
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
available so we feel that they have a um
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
a significant potential financial
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
interest in allowing their credential to
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
be uh included in the in the bill so it
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
is our recommendation that the house
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
committee amend the current bill to
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
exclude the language of credentialing
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
agencies which Senator Whitley talked
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
about line 7 to1 and allow the oplc to
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
engage in rulemaking Authority Under RSA
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
chapter 310 to determine the appropriate
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for duela and lactation
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
service provider certification in New
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%

organization um working through um New

Hampshire problems through policy
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
change um the reason new Futures
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
supports the bill um the idea for momys
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
was that there's a maternal mortality
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
crisis in the US currently and lactation
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
service providers and duas have um been
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
seen to reduce the issue and help um
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
fill in health
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
gaps I can take any questions all right
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
let's see if there are
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
any no doesn't look like it thank you
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
farahan good morning I'm fah and I feel
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
like I need a whiteboard for you all I'm
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
sorry that I don't have one I love
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
teaching and it's a little complicated
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
to do it when you need um some visual
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
aids and I think that would be really
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
helpful this morning for
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
us um dear chairperson Maguire and
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
members of the House executive
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
departments and administration committee
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
my name is Farah Sheen so I'm a
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
registered nurse I've been a nurse in
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for 27 years lots of time
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
um and I really appreciate this bill the
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
the overall you know Mom nibus and
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
assuring that families have access to
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
duela services and lactation providers
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
is really essential to address the
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
maternal morbidity and mortality he
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
Health crisis that we are experiencing
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
in our country and in our state I'm in
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
full support of Medicaid coverage for
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
duala services and lactation providers
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
so just out of the gate to be super
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
clear about that a master's prepared
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
registered nurse so I'm not quite the
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
highest level that I can get to in
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
nursing but up there um and like I said
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
I've been a registered nurse in New
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 27 years I've worked in
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Community settings all all
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
the time with moms babies families
 
00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:47.950 align:start position:0%
the time with moms babies families
perinatal

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
perinatal
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
care and um I currently have my own
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire as an
 
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
independent nurse ibclc and I also
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
provide Education and Training to
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
perinatal teams who are grappling with
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
improving the quality of care so just
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you a little bit of kind
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
of my background and where I've been
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
at um so I'm going to skip over in my
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I will I will make sure you
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
all have copies but um my support for du
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
Services I think we're all clear on that
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
it sounds like where the confusion is is
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
around the lactation so I'll just spend
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes trying to
 
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes trying to
clarify

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
um ibc's are international board
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
certified lactation Consultants that's
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about a little
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
bit they are generally people who are
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
already in the health care field nurses
 
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.830 align:start position:0%
already in the health care field nurses
midwives

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
midwives
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
dietitians and then after some years in
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
practice they often decide hey I want to
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
be more skilled in this area I want to
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
be able to provide um a level of care
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's higher than what I've been
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
providing we see this a lot in
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
healthcare right like when people go to
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
become a nurse practitioner after being
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
a nurse or um even in medicine they get
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
specialty so this is really similar in
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
in nursing with lactation care and so an
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
ibclc is an international board
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
certified lactation consultant who has
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
many many hours you know has to be
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
observed for at least a thousand hours
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
field they have to have at least 90
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
hours of continuing education above and
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
beyond just what they would have for
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
their regular nursing or dietitian or
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
whatever has to be really specific in
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
lactation and then they have to sit for
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
an exam just like you would do if you
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
were getting any other kind of specialty
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
in nursing or or
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
medicine so it's a really um it's a
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
world-renowned highlevel clinical
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
practice right it allows me as with my
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
ibclc to go out into the community and
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
care for families um with a high level
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
of skills so I'm not just providing
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
education and support but I'm actually
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
assessing for complicated um situations
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
in lactation and also just in the
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
overall health and well-being of the
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
family over the 27 years that I've been
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
a nurse some of the things that I've
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
identified in the home when I was going
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
out there to to look at what was
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
happening with lactation were other
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
complex medical issues like seizures um
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
malnutrition and failure to thrive
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
heart murmurs you know these types of
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
things that the skill that I have
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
allowed me to identify these problems
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
identified so it's really important that
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
people who are out in the community
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
practicing independently have a high
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
level of skill to be able to catch um
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
these more complicated conditions does
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
that make sense for that
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
piece certified lactation cons um
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
counselors which this um not the
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
original original bill but the amended
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
that had in those those other um you
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
know that named the specific
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
certifications the concern is is that if
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
we had let if we leave it like that and
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
we don't adopt the new Amendment from Dr
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
um from um Senator
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
Whitley we potentially could have
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
certified lactation counselors
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
independently working in the community
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
or the home setting and with my
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
experience and credentials and you know
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
the things that I've seen in in the
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
world I oppose that I don't think that
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
that's okay um I don't think it's safe I
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it's appropriate I think
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's really good that we have certified
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
lactation counselors clc's we need them
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
they're part of the Continuum of Care
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
they work in our Wick offices ready as
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
Joyce described it's fully federally
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
funded that right so we have that level
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
of care and in fact many of the duelas
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
who are going to be going out and
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
providing care for the families under
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
the nibus under this you know Medicaid
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursement will also be clc's lots of
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
Duos in the community are clc's that's
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
super appropriate they're certified
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
lactation counselors they're going to be
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
providing that basic level of care but
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
they're not ibclcs they're not providing
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
that higher skill and so they shouldn't
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
be billing independently in my opinion
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
piece um so that's really in a nutshell
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
you know kind of trying to explain like
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
the difference and you know my
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
experience um as a as a professional and
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
and you know what the potential um you
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
know how it looks kind of out there in
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
the world so I'm happy to take any
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown and then
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
luus thank you madam chair um and thanks
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
did did you say it's important for those
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
out with independent practice that they
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
aren't just a CLC did I not quite
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
understand what you said correct they
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be a CLC they should be
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
an ibclc an international board
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
certified lactation consult and if
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be practicing
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
completely independently and billing
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
under lactation Services I believe with
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
my years of experience in Education and
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
Training that that's what they should
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
have or a or a similar you know high
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
level now I don't know what what
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and oplc will decide but that's
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
definitely my input on that um but clc's
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
have a place they absolutely need to be
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
in the system and and they are already
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
in Wick and um and like I said many duas
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
who are going to be billing you know
 
00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
under this bill also are CLC so they
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
would be you know families are going to
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
be getting that care we're not taking
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
anything away from families is my point
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
by allowing medicate and op oplc to make
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
the decision on you know really who um
 
00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:50.919 align:start position:0%
should be um billing independently does
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
that make sense um you're essentially
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
saying that the lactation consultant is
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
a higher level of
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
professional training and service than
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
the clc's I am and that and that is the
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
case if you look at the actual um you
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
know what's required yeah to to achieve
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
that for sure okay thank you
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
represent y just for clarification uh
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
would you support this bill with the
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just got from Senator
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
Whitley absolutely I think it's
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the oplc to do their due
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
diligence and make a decision about you
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
know credentialing I I fully trust um
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know as a registered nurse obviously
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
I depend on them heavily for my my
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
licensing so I yeah I think that that's
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you okay any other
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
muler

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
muler
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
hello thank you chair McGuire Vice chair
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
Simon and members of the committee for
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify today my name
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
is Ellie mul and I am the director of
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
The Academy of lactation policy and
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
practice which is the certification body
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
for the certified lactation counselor
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
credential um I originally requested
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
three minutes to speak but I would
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
really like to address some of the um
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
misconceptions that have been shared
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
about our credential I am not an expert
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
in the ibclc credential nor do I pretend
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
to be I work for the Academy of
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
lactation policy and practice and work
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
directly with clc's um so I'm not going
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
to sit up here and try and dispute the
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
difference between the two providers but
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
some of the information that was shared
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
with about the CLC credential is
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
factually inaccurate so I would really
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
like to correct that with you all today
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and I should start by saying that we
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
do support the amendment that Senator
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
Whitley put forward today we're fine
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
with it being an oplc decision so long
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
as the language remains open to not pick
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
one credential in the state of New
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to become certified
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
through this pathway um if we're looking
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
at expansion of the workforce and
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
increasing access to care we need more
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
lactation providers not fewer and I
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
should add that clc's are the largest
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
group of lactation care providers in New
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with more than double the
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
number of ibc's in the state of New
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you have actual numbers
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I have actual numbers I shared them
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
with you before today but I'm happy to
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
share them again via email um I should I
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
would like to address first that 89.8
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
again I can share that number with you
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
89.8% of CLC work in hospital settings
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so you've heard time
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
and time again already that we're only
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
in Wick offices and in community offices
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
factually incorrect I have the numbers
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
we survey clc's every single uh three
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
months to make sure that those numbers
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
are up to date I should also add that
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
between 8 and 10 I can't remember the
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
exact number but I will get it between 8
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
to 10% of clc's are working in private
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
practice independently in New Hampshire
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
currently and there have been no cases
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
of practice concern for public health
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
harm to the public from those
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
providers um we've heard also that the
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
scope of practice of the CLC is not
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
similar to the ibclc that is also
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
factually inaccurate in fact if you look
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
line by line at our scopes of practice
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're almost identical again I'm not
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to sit up here and pretend that I
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
know the ibclc scope of practice forward
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
and back but I will add that it is
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
within the scope of practice of a CLC to
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
complex to assess and um support and
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
help to solve complex breastfeeding
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
issues that occur and also to assess for
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
those situations and circumstances that
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
predispose families to challenging
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding experiences so we are not
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
just a basic uh lactation educator we
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
are far more than that and that's uh
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
really symbolized by the fact that the
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
Center for Disease Control the CDC and
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
the United States breastfeeding
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
committee recogn izes both the ibclc and
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
the CLC as professional lactation
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
support providers which was our impetus
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
to get the CLC included in Senator
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
Whitley's initial introduction of the
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill um so we were very happy when that
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
was amended with overwhelming bipartisan
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
support in the Senate and with the help
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
of oplc and um dhs's Medicaid director
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman who I wish was here today
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
because he is a wonderful person to work
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
with um I think the bottom line that
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up with is to increase access
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
to lactation care we need more providers
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
um people could have sat up here and
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
talked about all of the benefits of
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and I'm sure you've heard
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
it many times through the research
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're vast um and very important we
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
need to increase access to care and to
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
allow people the choice to choose a
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
provider who they feel most comfortable
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
seeing um in no other field do we say
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
you can see one type of provider and
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's who you have to pick but if we
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
know that a provider is going to be
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by insurance people are going
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
to pick the provider that's reimbursed
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
by their insurance company it's it's
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
obvious um so we really see this as
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
needing to include more lactation
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
providers um and I'm just I'm happy to
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
may have thank
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you I don't see any oh
 
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.230 align:start position:0%
you thank you I don't see any oh
representing

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
piart I'm just curious how many
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
lactation providers do we have what
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
number are we looking at so again I
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't know the CL the ibclc number off
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but there's 22 clc's
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
believe it was less than half of or
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe slightly over half of ibclc so 164
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
165 it's all on their website as well as
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
it is on ours and just follow up follow
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
up are some duel certified there are
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
many people who are clc's and ibc's
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
together um so you don't know that
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
though with that 221 number what that I
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
could look it up and send it to you
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah we collect that
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
information so absolutely okay thank you
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you for your
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much is there
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%

Veterans organizations identified

digital occupational licensing as a way
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
to assist military families facing

Mobility challenges work Mobility

challenges military families are three
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
times more likely to move than civilian
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
families and this prevent uh presents a
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
number of challenges to military working
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
family and spouses trying to maintain a
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
professional career approximately 30% of

military spouses maintain a professional
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
or occupational license a recent US
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense report found that
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
about half of military spouses
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
experiencing a permanent change of
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
Station Move experience problems with
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%

experience a loss of
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
income military spouses and Veterans
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
make up a significant portion of New
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens approximately 10% and
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
many of these citizens move from state
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
to state at a higher rate than most
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
people this means that professional
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
licensing and the efficient processing
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
of licenses from state to state is a
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
major issue for these workers and their
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
families a digital licensing platform
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
would create a secure pre pre verified
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
database that provides the state with
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
accurate up-to-date information on
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
individuals licensing status the goal
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
being to reduce license approval time
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
from weeks or months to a few days the
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
process can also be flexible and
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
customized to the state individual
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
licenses can be excluded from the
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
digital licensing process or unique
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements can be flagged
 
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
for individual review and notification
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
in addition depending on the needs of
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
the state the prever verification
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
process can be for can be performed by
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
an outside vendor or through
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration between state agencies and
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
vendors finally several states have
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
embraced the use of digital licensing
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
Kansas and Rhode Island have recently
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
moved forward with military licens
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and Virginia's Department of
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
Professional and occupational regulation
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
has taken a broader approach by
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
initiating uh digital licensing for more
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
than 114 licensing types over 40
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
professions several years ago New
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire embraced the concept of
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensed Reciprocity for the military
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 485 would be the next
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
step to ensure the reciprocity process
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
happens in an efficient and timely way
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time this
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
morning I really appreciate this and
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
I think I can probably answer some
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
questions but um folks are here that
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
have been really involved in this
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
process from the very beginning who
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
could probably answer your questions
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
much uh I do have a question we recently
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
changed the military licensing process
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
to some degree by requiring the Office
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
of Veterans Affairs to work with
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
um to get the military codes properly
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
aligned with licenses and to work with
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
oplc on that how does this affect that
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and I was
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
just speaking with representative Brown
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
um the Senate has House Bill
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
1385 which speaks to that and in fact
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to bring in an amendment
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
I believe representative Brown is
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with that that deals with each
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
military occupational specialty and will
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
give them the ability to
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
um to examine each one and come up with
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
a code through Ru making and I I just
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
see this as being a partner to that that
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
once we get through that process then we
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
can work on assigning the digital part
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
of it to make it easier but we H I do
 
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
believe we need to go through that first
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
step okay so this bill is effective 6
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
days if that comment is correct it
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
year I would like to think it wouldn't
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
take that long but I'm not sure if 60
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
days is an appropriate time considering
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
you've got these two pieces of
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
legislation moving and that's why I
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
think that um if someone's here from um
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Affairs they they're
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
watching both of these and fig we can
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
work with them to figure out how to get
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
them both done in an efficient
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
time okay any other questions or for
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson represent blackis uh I
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
think I saw executive director uh
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
Courtney come in if that's true I think
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
the question's probably better for her
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
okay we will invite executive director
 
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney to speak any other questions
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
for Senator Carson representative Brown
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
just thank you madam chair just as a
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
note in in the amendment that the
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
senator was speaking to it's what we had
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
talked about in subcommittee and here
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
because it's rul making that we're
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at in 1385 to sort of create
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
this crosswalk uh we made it January 1st
 
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.950 align:start position:0%
this crosswalk uh we made it January 1st
of

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
20 six I believe I have to look back at
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I don't know that that
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily means that what they're
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do with a digital license
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
would have to be that same time frame we
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
can we can uh determine that we can
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
coordinate I'm sure there will be some
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh overlap
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay the questions for the senator thank
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much Madam
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
chair and since we already have
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
Courtney good morning Madam chair
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Lindsay
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
oplc um so we were following this bill
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and as originally
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
introduced it really um dealt primarily
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the digitally verifiable licensed
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
piece our position was that we don't
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
take a position because we already have
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
an electronic platform which I will say
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
is not the best um but we are migrating
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
to a new solution and therefore already
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
verify uh licenses
 
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
digitally um that said throughout that
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
discussion there was conversations about
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
what are the true barriers for um
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
military service members and their
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
spouses um individuals coming out of
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
military service to seeking a license in
 
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
you Hampshire and it's always been that
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
there isn't a clear pathway from um your
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
experience in the military your
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
education experience um to transition to
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
a license because the two
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
experiences um while provide the same um
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
education and experience are not spelled
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
out in our statutes and rules so we need
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
crosswalk the requirement to do the
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
crosswalk for military service members
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
has been in 332g since I think
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
2016 I could be wrong on the dates but
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
for quite some time um but the boards
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
haven't taken steps to do the
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
crosswalks um and so what this would do
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
is essentially require the oplc to work
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
with Department of um dmav and um get
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
the crosswalk done it's very similar to
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
what's been proposed
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
um in House Bill 1385 and I think um we
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
would recommend taking a look and Mar
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
basically marrying the two to make sure
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
that they're consistent with each other
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
um but we are ready willing and able to
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
work with DMF um to get that done happy
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
to take any other
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
blackis yeah um I think sort of answered
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
that and that was how does this interact
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
with 1385 and what's your view on the
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
best way to deal with u whatever
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
interaction there
 
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
is so we've we've been working
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
internally with the Department of
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
military and Veterans Affairs for the
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
past year and a half trying to um solve
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
this issue they have a dedicated staff
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
member um and we have a dedicated staff
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
member who um whose project for their
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
CPM project was um to come up with ways
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
to provide port ility for military
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
service members and their spouses the
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
challenge has been one of authority um
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen a few boards kind of push
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
back on the idea of creating this
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
crosswalk um and so that's that's where
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
the barrier lies but I think there are
 
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
really only a handful of professions
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
that we could um determine a an actual
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
crosswalk to lier in New Hampshire under
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
the office there are certainly other
 
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
crosswalks for other uh license saves to
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
the office that that could be done as
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
well and I don't I think it's something
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we can get done in a fairly um
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
short amount of
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
time follow up followup so the question
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
is if well Senate Bill 485 as it's it
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
currently exists and 1385 as it
 
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.230 align:start position:0%
currently exists and 1385 as it
currently

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
exists um is there any problem if both
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
of these got passed would they help with
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
the solution I mean what's trying to
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
figure out what's the best way to help
 
00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
this along yes so I think they both are
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
intended to accomplish the same things I
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
think what we want to do is look at the
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
language and make sure that um they sink
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
up with each other so you know 1385
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
there were some additional modifications
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
I believe as it currently stands um
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's a proposed modification to 332g
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
to capture those license types that
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't fall under
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
oplc um to require those entities those
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
boards to uh do the crosswalk um if it's
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I I think that's
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
something that we would certainly want
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
to include um if the goal is to make
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we're providing Pathways for
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
military service members and their
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
spouses who are qualified um so I think
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
you know I think I don't know if this
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
would if you're having a subcommittee
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
but I think this would be something that
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
we could certainly work on and look at
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment 1385 and make
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they um they jve with each
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
other question for the chair uh is this
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee and LIC yes and I
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
think it's going to representative grot
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
because it appears to be
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
an organizational issue rather than a
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements issue we're all
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
clear on that I won't pursue any more on
 
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.870 align:start position:0%
clear on that I won't pursue any more on
this

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
here okay representative
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair maybe more
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
for representative Brown for 332g
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
capturing the other boards that don't
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
fall under oplc we didn't get that
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
language in did we okay so that would be
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
something we have to do here and yes if
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
I could follow up on that follow up that
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is the the uh proposed uh Amendment
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
that Senator Carson was speaking to adds
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
that adds that back in as we talked
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
about in committee here and and the date
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
was January 1st of 26 I look back
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
through my emails um I and if I can
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
follow up just a tiny bit more there
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
aren't too many really there aren't too
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
many differences in these there's some
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
language that we changed based on opl's
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
preference for how things are said um
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
but the the the Senate Bill 485 does
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
have the substantially similar comment
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
in it that we have been sort of getting
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
away from I think so okay but they're
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
they're very it's it's not really much
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
difference in the two I don't think all
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
right then I will uh charge the
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with looking at House Bill
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
1385 as well and possibly trying to
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
combine the two bills to make sure there
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
is no
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
conflict any other questions for uh
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
director represent laas on a slightly
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
different topic uh this is on the
 
00:58:53.079 --> 00:58:54.109 align:start position:0%
different topic uh this is on the
digital

00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
licensing um I mean what is the state of
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
that you know would it make sense for
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
that to exist or is it planned to exist
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
for all licenses whether it's military
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
people or related people or
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
not so I think there we need to
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
understand what is what is meant by
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable license um because
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
the way I interpret it is just we can
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
verify it digitally um and uh we already
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
have that capacity
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly if there were um there was
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
a desire for us to have greater
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
functionality um then that would require
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
us to go through the traditional
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
procurement process which is a lengthy
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
process um something we do all the time
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
but you know that's that's about a
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
two-year process from starting the RFP
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
and um you know awarding a contract
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
going through governor and Council and
 
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
then coming up with an implementation
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
strategy and you'd also need funding
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
available so um I don't know if that
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
answers your question but we already
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
have electronic verification we do all
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
of our licensing well I shouldn't say
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
all we do the large majority of our
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
licensing online there are some paper
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
applications but we're in the middle of
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
a migration to a new platform um the
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
first set of professions is supposed to
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
go live sometime in
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
June just sort of a followup kind of i'
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
suggest the sub commmittee maybe better
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
Define what's meant by a digitally
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
verified license abely unclear to me
 
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.069 align:start position:0%
verified license abely unclear to me
thank

01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%

with

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair distinguished
 
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is uh
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
Scott wiro and I work for a company
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
called Merit International Incorporated
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh we're a technology company that
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
provides solutions to State and local
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
governments uh to include but uh to
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
include digital licensing verification
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm a military spouse of a combat
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
veteran uh she's had four deployments to
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
of which uh
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
where in Afghanistan where I met her
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
she's a proud UNH grad where she did her
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
Roc and and received her commission uh
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
and she's sorry she actually couldn't
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
make the trip with me here today um so
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
as a military spouse uh SB 485 is very
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
close to my heart uh as a military
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
spouse uh Meritt is part of the Aspire
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh which stands for the
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
alliance for States providing
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
interoperable reciprocity quite a
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
multiple but is focused specifically on
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
trying to facilitate the transfer of
 
01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:29.559 align:start position:0%
licenses for military spouses when they
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
do a permanent change of station um as
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier this is quite an
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
issue for military spouses and it can
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
result in quite a significant loss of
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
income which disproportionately affects
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh lower ranking members of the military
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and so uh we are working within the
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
coalition to try to provide a solution
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the effects of those uh
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
delays in lure and I'm here to provide
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh testimony and support of the bill
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
that is currently uh before you um the
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
Aspire Coalition if I could uh is made
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
up of 11 members uh the association of
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
the United States Army blue star
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
families the National military spouse
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
Network veterans Health and Wellness
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation women veterans interactive
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
Merit International as I mentioned the
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
military spouse Chamber of Commerce the
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
military offers Officers Association of
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
America the US Department of Defense
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
military spouse employment partnership
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
the women veterans and families Network
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the Workforce Solutions of Central
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
Texas so it is a broad Coalition uh that
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
is all working towards this this same
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
aim um we work with uh state governments
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
to build an efficient digital solution
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
that solves The Last Mile uh of the
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
licensing reciprocity process by making
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
the transfer of licenses from one state
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
to another to another safe secure and
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
ideally uh
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
instantaneous uh as I mentioned elat and
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
transferring licenses have huge
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
consequences for military families but
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
by using current state-ofthe-art techn
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
Tech Solutions uh for combining
 
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.789 align:start position:0%
Tech Solutions uh for combining
licensing

01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
portability legislation with a digital
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
platform for
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
interoperability verified credentials
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
speeds the process and simplifies the
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
transfer of licenses from one state to
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
another um as was sort of mentioned if
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
an active duty service member receives
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
PCS orders and their spouse is a nurse
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
the spouse would want to quickly find
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
employment when they moved uh to their
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
new state to do so they would need to
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
get a copy of their nursing license from
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
the originating State and share it with
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
the new state however they may encounter
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
challenges and delays receiving and
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
sharing a copy of the license and once
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
shared the plausible different
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements between states could cause
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
the spouse to need additional training
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
furthering the time of
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
relicensure add to that the fact that
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
each state has a different process that
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
the military spouses must navigate every
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
time that they move
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
with an effective digital solution
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
licensing portability requirements
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
between states would be clearly mapped
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
and communicated to military spouses and
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
Veterans guiding them through the
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
process of verifying their license when
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
PCS orders are received military spouses
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
would access their Merit app on their
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
mobile device select their originating
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
State and the state that they're
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
transferring to then the license or
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
certifications they hold the app would
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
display all of the steps necessary and
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
document ation required for transferring
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
their license the license holder could
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
also upload any required documentation
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
such as military orders discharge orders
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
or a marriage
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
certificate we hope that this would then
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
put the spouse in a position where they
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
no long longer feel left in the dark
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
during this process as the app tracks
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
ontime status of the license and
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
documentation as they're verified the
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
moment reciprocity is granted the
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
license holder would receive a digital
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
version of their license through the app
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
along with a Q QR code that potential
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
employers can use for instant license
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
verification licens spouses veterans and
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
family members can get back to work
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
weeks or months faster every time they
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
must move saving unemployment costs and
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
helping bolster local economy through
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
income and
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
tax um in Illinois this this process
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
currently takes two to three months for
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers uh to attain their
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
license it state government is currently
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the process of uh solving this
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
problem working very close with them on
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
that um the Pennsylvania Board of
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
Nursing for example takes 12 weeks uh
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
for its State's nurses to receive
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
licenses more than half of the 12,000
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
nurses who are issued licenses in 2021
 
01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
LED waited at least three months
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
according to a recent report milit
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
military spouses on average wait 42 days
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
to be relicensed which on average is a
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
loss of income totaling approximately
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for low ranking military members
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned and their families this
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
has an enormous impact on their
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
household income and quality of life
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
barbering or cosme ology license if they
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
have to say shave the hair off your arm
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
before doing
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
surgery which which is actually covered
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
under under cosmetology and other
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
professionals are Exempted so we want
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
physician assistance to be Exempted
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
also and the other is to clarify the
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements which
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
may need further
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
education and um
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
well I
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
will try to um answer any questions but
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's about all I know about this
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
bill any questions yes representative
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
leas it's the one I I kind of brought up
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
offline and that is there is something
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
under definitions on requirements for
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
continuing education that lists a number
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
of options I don't think they're
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
identical to what's in this bill and
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
probably we need to look at those to
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
that strikes me as duplic something the
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
reason to send this bill to your
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to clarify what the current
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
because uh as I recall they aren't very
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
well defined yeah there's a list but
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
nowhere does it in definitions but
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
nowhere does it say you have to meet
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
them it's like it's this H hanging thing
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
we can look at it subcommittee well
 
01:17:49.719 --> 01:17:51.790 align:start position:0%
we can look at it subcommittee well
that's

01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh exactly the kind of thing
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are needing needed to work
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
on I will not say that this bill is
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
better than what's current currently in
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
statute it's trying to be
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
more expansive and that's about
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
much Grant I can never remember if it's
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
bossy thank you representative sorry
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
slightly late Senator Pearl asked me to
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
pinch hit on very short notice he got
 
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.629 align:start position:0%
pinch hit on very short notice he got
called

01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
away um good morning members of the
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Grant bossy here to
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 488 on behalf of
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl the prime sponsor uh this
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill cleans up two separate and
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
unrelated regulatory items concerning
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
physician assistance section one
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
authorizes oplc and the Board of
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine to maintain continuing medical
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
education records for Pas who choose not
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
to maintain their accreditation section
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
two corrects the omission of physician
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
assistance from the exemptions under RSA
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
313 a25 in line with the dozen other
 
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
categories of healthcare providers
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the barbering cosmetology
 
01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics license this was simply
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
an oversight uh Senator Pearl has worked
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
with oplc and the PAs to craft this
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation which received unanimous
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
support in the Senate if you have
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions I'll make sure Senator PE gets
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%

488 thank you great thank you any
 
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.030 align:start position:0%
488 thank you great thank you any
questions

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
seeing done thank you very much for your
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
you good morning uh I'd say Madam chair
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
although I see she's behind me um and
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Sarah Lesley I'm a licensed
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
PA in New Hampshire and I live in
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
Deerfield I'm the vice president of the
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Society PA as well as the
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
co-chair for our society's legislative
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh as not Senator Pearl noted
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
this bill would clean up two unrelated
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
issues pertinent to PA regulations and
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
the first deals with continuing medical
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
education recordkeeping uh when we
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
passed SP uh 228 two years ago we had a
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
little oversight whenever it went to the
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine it was pointed out to
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
us um that we took out of Statute that a
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
PA needs to maintain their nccpa
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
certification out of Statute which
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
brought us in line with the majority of
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
the other states in the US um but we
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
didn't give the Board of Medicine the
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
power to delegate to oplc the ability to
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
um maintain our CME for those Pas those
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
very few Pas that don't maintain their
 
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
very few Pas that don't maintain their
nccpa

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
nccpa
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
certification um so specifically s488
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
gives oplc and the Board of Medicine the
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
ability to maintain CMEs for Pas who
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
choose not to maintain their
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
certification it's very like I said it's
 
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
very few Pas that would do that um most
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
of us are employers require that we
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
maintain our nccpa certification but say
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
a retired pa um that doesn't want to sit
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
for a high stakes exam but wants to
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
maintain their license um those are kind
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the the small Niche group that it
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
would apply to um and then the Pas who
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
maintain their nccpa certification of
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
course our 100 CME is followed by the
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
nccpa we have to do that every two years
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain our CT and then of
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
course sit for the high high stakes exam
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
every uh 10 years state law does not
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
require that Pas maintain our
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
certification through the nccpa but we
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
must maintain our CME so this fix simply
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
gives oplc the ability to maintain the
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
CME for those Pas and the second Bill
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
corrects just an Omission we spent a lot
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
of time looking through statute and
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
regulations finding where our name is
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
either written in correctly or we're
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
just not in there um we find a lot of
 
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
places where Physicians nurse
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners are listed but we just
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
inadvertently are not so this um
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these fixes are simple but
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
they require legislation um currently
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
law exempts many healthare providers
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
from needing a barbering cosmetology and
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics license due to that oversight
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
with the Pas were not given the same
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
exception as our doctors nurses and
 
01:22:02.679 --> 01:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
exception as our doctors nurses and
other

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
practitioners this bill simply exempts
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
Pas from needing this license both parts
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill were drafted in cooperation
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
with oplc um and if you have any
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to take them thank
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony any
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
chair in the in the bill there's the
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
word requirements continuing medic
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
medical education requirements and
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
everyone keeps saying recordkeeping and
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
law I don't know that it's clear that
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
it's recordkeeping um can you clarify
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
that for me in any
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
way have the actual law in front of you
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
can I steal that the actual stat yeah
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
well not the okay that's the bill itself
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes um so record keeping so basic
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
basically with it it's just delegating
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the power to the Board of Medicine to or
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
giving the power to the Board of
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
Medicine to then allow oplc to maintain
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
our our CME
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so let me see what it actually says
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
and I apologize as a followup yeah
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I understood but it says
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirements which wouldn't mean the
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
same thing to me necessarily so what
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
what would happen then the Board of
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine would then decide what our CME
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
requirements would be which when we had
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
chatted with them we said about just
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
keeping the same that we have with the
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
CCPA which would be 100 um total CME
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
every 2 years and 50 of those need to be
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
category one which are certificate based
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
um continued medical medical education
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
credits so the Board of Medicine would
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
then decide what um what those CME would
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
be and then the oplc would then track it
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
for us as they are doing for
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians any other
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you very
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony okay did anybody

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
488 seeing n I'll close the public
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on S SP 488 I'll refer the bill
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%

licensure and certification over the

years these many disperate boards have
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
widely varying policies and levels of
 
03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
compliance with New Hampshire's op
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
meetings law sp sp 369 would establish a
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
baseline of 14 days for meetings to be
 
03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed with exemptions for
 
03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:15.960 align:start position:0%

provide the opportunity for public
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
comment similar to guarantees this

03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
municipal meeetings the bill is similar
 
03:18:28.030 --> 03:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
to a bill vetoed by the governor but
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson believes the changes
 
03:18:33.309 --> 03:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
address his concerns sp sp 369 also
 
03:18:35.189 --> 03:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
establishes a new attorney position with
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
oplc to ensure it has the capacity to
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
comply with the public notice
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
requirements the fiscal impact would be
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
$106,000 in
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
fy2 SB 369 has twice received receive
 
03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
the unanimous support of the Senate I
 
03:18:50.309 --> 03:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
would defer questions to the subject
 
03:18:52.349 --> 03:18:52.359 align:start position:0%

03:19:21.229 --> 03:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
good morning committee Mr chairman uh my
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
name is Steve rort I'm here representing
 
03:19:26.710 --> 03:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
the electrical contractors Business
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
Association and licensed electricians um
 
03:19:31.229 --> 03:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
we are in favor and support of this bill
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
we we tried to worked to get this
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
through last year as I mentioned and it
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
just had a couple issues and concerns
 
03:19:37.229 --> 03:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
the governor had and I think we've
 
03:19:39.309 --> 03:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
worked through it it's there's a lot of
 
03:19:41.550 --> 03:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
hearings that are had just monthly um
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
meetings for boards and stuff and
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
everything and it's very tough for us to
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
as a public to be part of it when they
 
03:19:49.229 --> 03:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
only have 24 hours notice so technically
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
they like for example they have a
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
meeting once a month for the
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
electricians board and it might be
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled on on there for April 5th and
 
03:19:57.309 --> 03:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
they don't if it's not going to be till
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
April 9th they don't have to post it
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
till April 8th so many times I've come
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
up here and it's been canceled or change
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
and you and you've wasted a lot of time
 
03:20:06.670 --> 03:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
and I've lost a lot of money to come be
 
03:20:08.349 --> 03:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
part of it and it happens with all of
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
them in the rules hearings and stuff so
 
03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
this gives a couple weeks notice at
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
least the boards and the oplc the
 
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
ability if there's an emergency to add
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
it to the agenda it's not trying to make
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
it so tough that they can't do that just
 
03:20:20.429 --> 03:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
giving some notification for these
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
meetings so that people from the public
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
can be part of especially with all the
 
03:20:25.710 --> 03:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
changes that's going on with OPC and all
 
03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
the bills out there it's really hard to
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
keep track of so how's that under two
 
03:20:32.429 --> 03:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
minutes perfect well done any questions
 
03:20:35.349 --> 03:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
Greta are you familiar with the concerns
 
03:20:40.590 --> 03:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
that the governor had and what how were
 
03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
they addressed in this bill believe the
 
03:20:44.110 --> 03:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
concerns were if was an emergency
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
meeting let me just look at the uh
 
03:20:50.189 --> 03:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
and if there was the ability to have
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
that meeting and add something to the
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
agenda within 48 hours if the the the
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board feels that the
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
urgency of the issue overrides the
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
public notification and I believe that
 
03:21:05.469 --> 03:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
they give seven calendar days I believe
 
03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
they also Dro on line 11 um the chair of
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
the board of counsel shall I Adam s
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
within seven calendar days of the
 
03:21:15.150 --> 03:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
meeting at the chair's discretion and it
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
continues to go on to just discuss what
 
03:21:20.710 --> 03:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
that is what they would use to to to
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
meet that um those I think were the two
 
03:21:26.830 --> 03:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
things was not having um the ability to
 
03:21:28.349 --> 03:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
add something in emergency like for a
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
situation we had the massachusett
 
03:21:32.550 --> 03:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
electrican would stop um reciprocity
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
with in Hampshire for electrical and we
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
only found out about it a day before the
 
03:21:38.189 --> 03:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
board meeting something like that was
 
03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
very important to respond to so gives
 
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
them the ability to add that so I think
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
those two things were the biggest
 
03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:45.510 align:start position:0%
those two things were the biggest
concerns

03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:21:45.520 --> 03:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
concerns
what

03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
and you may not be able to answer this
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
but was there an appropriation for an
 
03:21:53.309 --> 03:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
additional head count in the in the bill
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
that Governor the governor vetto
 
03:21:57.870 --> 03:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
originally I believe there was an
 
03:21:59.630 --> 03:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes okay thank you y and
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal any other questions seeing none
 
03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
hop

03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Douglas Hoster out oplc I
 
03:22:27.229 --> 03:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
should be really brief um I can also
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
answer questions if you have questions
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
about the bills and sort of the
 
03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
governor's position is as much as I'm
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
aware of it um I did send around a
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment yesterday to the
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
chair the vice chair and the clerk I
 
03:22:42.189 --> 03:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
don't know in some written testimony um
 
03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
just I think there might be a mistake in
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
the language uh I pointed out a comma I
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
don't believe needs to exist on line
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
five and page one but the bigger issue
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
is there's a part of a sentence in the
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
proposed seven and eight
 
03:23:01.189 --> 03:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
area that would keep the record open for
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
seven days and the way I read this it's
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
open for seven days for the public the
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
spoken comment I believe that was
 
03:23:10.469 --> 03:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
intended to be keep the record open for
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
the written comment so I just the
 
03:23:14.389 --> 03:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
amendment basically switches those
 
03:23:17.150 --> 03:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
around um I don't know everybody's had a
 
03:23:21.710 --> 03:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.269 --> 03:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative was that emailed
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
to the committee it was emailed to the
 
03:23:29.229 --> 03:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
chair Vice chair and clerk I saw it yeah
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh should I send it to the
 
03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee or is
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
that okay I'll do that today um but
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
other than that um I didn't have any
 
03:23:43.950 --> 03:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions um I just I just have one just
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity I know that it's coming
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
out of the uh Office Professional lure
 
03:23:53.150 --> 03:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
and certification fund but you guys need
 
03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
a full-fledged lawyer to post meetings I
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
think so
 
03:23:59.710 --> 03:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
because it's it's sort of similar we've
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
had discussions on like the 1527
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
language 1622 it's the same idea there
 
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
could be confidential information so
 
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
everything that we post we want to post
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
timely and that has to undergo uh some
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
sort of legal review in order to make
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
sure we're not you know putting out home
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
home addresses uh phone numbers those
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
kind of things or whatever information
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't normally be subject to
 
03:24:23.790 --> 03:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
disclosure under
 
03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:25.670 align:start position:0%
disclosure under
9185

03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
9185
 
03:24:30.910 --> 03:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
much would anybody else like to testify
 
03:24:36.510 --> 03:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.550 --> 03:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
369 seeing none I will close the public
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and we will reconvene in 35
 
03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.319 --> 03:25:45.229 align:start position:0%
 
committee

03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.239 --> 03:25:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.950 --> 03:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I I uh we do have a forum
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to discuss Senate Bill
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%

03:26:15.239 --> 03:26:28.429 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%

03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
blackis yeah I guess you need a motion
 
03:26:37.269 --> 03:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
to start things out um I'll move to
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 1386
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
s okay I'll
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
second you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
I do um you know there's a lot of
 
03:26:49.950 --> 03:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
discussion we heard
 
03:26:52.269 --> 03:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
about which outfits should handle the
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
certification and all that but what this
 
03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
will do uh with the amendment is let
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
that be hashed out during rule making um
 
03:27:02.590 --> 03:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
with oplc and everybody who has an
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
interest in their view on it should have
 
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be involved in yes
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
BR nothing to add thank you okay i' I'd
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
like to mention that this is a an early
 
03:27:17.790 --> 03:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
Bill and it is going on to
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
another another committee which I think
 
03:27:22.110 --> 03:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
is Health and Human
 
03:27:26.910 --> 03:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
Services um oh the financial numbers are
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
probably going to be
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
sure ah fine we will approve the intent
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
and worry about the
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
detail not supposed to do that first
 
03:27:50.670 --> 03:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
Carol uh chair yes as people people have
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
been mentioning this is a senate
 
03:27:53.790 --> 03:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
amendment can we do this we can't use
 
03:27:55.710 --> 03:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
that we can't do that we will need to
 
03:27:57.389 --> 03:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
get a house
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
amendment can we execute like this or no
 
03:28:03.070 --> 03:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
can we have the executive session
 
03:28:05.710 --> 03:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
contingent on representative lucus going
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
to Ops and getting the amendment under
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
his name
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
or I go do it now we could yeah a second
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
thought why don't we not vote on this
 
03:28:26.429 --> 03:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
until after we get the amendment it
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
sound like it would
 
03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
be it sound like that would be a uh an
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
exercise all right
 
03:28:37.150 --> 03:28:37.160 align:start position:0%

introducing Senate Bill 3 371 on Senator

Fenton's behalf and I'll be reading it
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
directly into the record as written by
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
him I am state senator Donovan Fenton
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
and I represent district 10
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
chesher Medical Center in Keen is in my
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
district and the training place to
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
training Physicians for several sessions
 
04:02:54.189 --> 04:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with the office of
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
professional Li lure and
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
certification this committee and house
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
Edna has worked hard to streamline
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
licensing processes this work has
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
ensured timely access to lure and
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
gainful employment in New Hampshire
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you last year House Bill 655
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
created a lot of efficiencies within
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
oplc one of those was moving all license
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
renewals to every 2 years this is
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
largely celebrated however there is one
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
group that now has some concerns about
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
the 2-year requirement and that is
 
04:03:30.199 --> 04:03:31.870 align:start position:0%
the 2-year requirement and that is
resident

04:03:31.870 --> 04:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
resident
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians currently the Board of
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
Medicine is working with hospitals to
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
license their forthcoming resident
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
Physicians oplc is working toward an
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
online system which I believe will be
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
live by June 30th of this year our
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
resident Physicians are concerned about
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
their ability to support the LI lure of
 
04:03:54.910 --> 04:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
these residents this bill would allow
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
the board to work with oplc to allow for
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
licenses that are slightly longer than 2
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
years removing the requirement that a
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
resident physician renew their license
 
04:04:07.469 --> 04:04:07.479 align:start position:0%
in the middle of their
 
04:04:09.790 --> 04:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
residency this bill will positively
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
impact Dartmouth Hitchcock and other
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals including Dairy Medical and
 
04:04:14.239 --> 04:04:15.550 align:start position:0%
hospitals including Dairy Medical and
conquered

04:04:15.550 --> 04:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
hospital I believe Dartmouth health is
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%

not that anymore good afternoon Courtney
 
04:05:00.550 --> 04:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner for the record I'm the senior

director of government relations at
 
04:05:03.870 --> 04:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health um here to support
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 371 very grateful for uh
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
that Senator Fenton brought this forward
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
um we really as you know um are
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing Workforce constraints on
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
similar to all sectors in our economy um
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
and really see this as one piece of the
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
pie that will help us to ensure LIC
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
insure for a critical component of our
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce at the at the medical center
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
so these are resident Physicians um who
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
are with us usually on average between
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
three to four years um and right now um
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
we are creating lensy packets that go to
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine um in our process
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
for their for their time that they're
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
with us for their residency
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh they don't have to reapply for
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
a license every single year um I want to
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
uncore that we appreciate all the work
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
that oplc and this committee has done to
 
04:05:59.229 --> 04:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
streamline licensing processes for other
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
types of licenses this is just a little
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
bit of a niche area and we again are
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
very grateful to Senator Fenton for
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward and are hopeful
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
that um that this committee will support
 
04:06:12.030 --> 04:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
it so if I understand correctly
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
residents Physicians are liced Ed as
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians they are they are okay do you
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
think it is that much of a hardship for
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
them to figure out after two years they
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
have to apply for a renewal so um it's
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
something that our medical staff office
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
actually handles and supports and so um
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's really done in concert with our gme
 
04:06:35.710 --> 04:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
office our graduate Medical Education
 
04:06:38.110 --> 04:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
Office uh and it's something that we do
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
support them with because they're
 
04:06:41.710 --> 04:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
working extremely long hours um they're
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
working beyond the 40-hour work week
 
04:06:46.710 --> 04:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
like the like most um so it is something
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we support them to
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
do okay that's interesting anyone else
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you madam
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
chair um in in the law and this may be
 
04:07:03.309 --> 04:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
not relevant to the wording in the bill
 
04:07:05.950 --> 04:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
but in the law it says that the board
 
04:07:08.189 --> 04:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
chillis Who special training
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
licenses uh Etc in a regular residency
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
or graduate Fellowship training program
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
so so would it make sense that this
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
should say a residency training license
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
or does it not need to say that because
 
04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
it references the
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
law um well actually I believe that oplc
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh I Doug may be testifying after
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
actually has an amendment to this that
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
is a slight change in verbiage so that
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
may address your question thank
 
04:07:33.279 --> 04:07:36.469 align:start position:0%
may address your question thank
you

04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.479 --> 04:07:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
Tony um how long what's the longest that
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
somebody might be a resident and need
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
this license sure
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
um so the longest that a residency would
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
go to is up to S years if you're a
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
surgical resident um but usually on
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
average our residents are wor us three
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
to four
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.149 --> 04:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
else guess I'm going to go back to
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I mean sorry
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
chair McGuire's question
 
04:08:14.830 --> 04:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
about the hardship because I
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like a more concrete answer if
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
possible sure uh so we so like I said we
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
support um we support these licenses in
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
their application process and so this
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
helps us to ensure that we as an
 
04:08:29.840 --> 04:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
helps us to ensure that we as an
institution

04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
institution
 
04:08:35.469 --> 04:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
um uh so for doctors they have to be
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
licensed and then have to be credential
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
and privileged and these this subset is
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
also supervised and so um this our
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
support our administrative support of
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
the license as one component to ensuring
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
that this Workforce can be actively
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
practicing at the at our Medical Center
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so um we this has to go through our
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
graduate medication office and so we
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's not so much of a hardship for the
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
physician themselves for our medical
 
04:09:01.640 --> 04:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
physician themselves for our medical
staffing

04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
office don't doctors have to have their
 
04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
licenses renewed every two years as well
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes they do so follow
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
up so I I guess are you saying that The
 
04:09:21.790 --> 04:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
Graduate Office is the one that's
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
burdened while your medical office is
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
not who who who you know renews the
 
04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
doctor's licenses so I actually would
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that that
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
question um this is again this is a
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
subset that I've been working with our
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
medical staff office because this has
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
been this will be a significant change
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
that will happen um when the online
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay represent Simon Madam chair I'll
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
feel silly if I don't understand this
 
04:09:51.520 --> 04:09:53.309 align:start position:0%
feel silly if I don't understand this
correctly

04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
um is the bill trying to
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh not having these people
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
have to renew their licenses every two
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
years so they get to go longer than that
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
before they have to renew license or
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have to renew license or so
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
status quo right now the Board of
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
Medicine is approving resident physician
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
licenses for the length of time that
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be being in their
 
04:10:17.109 --> 04:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
resident so um right now what ha status
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
quo what happens before this online
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
system is stood up um uh Family Practice
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
resident physician would come through
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
our graduate medic medic gme office
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
graduate medical education and um apply
 
04:10:33.870 --> 04:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
for a three-year residency so Jane Smith
 
04:10:35.149 --> 04:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
her packet would go to the board of
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
medicine for a three-year license um a
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
surgical resident would go for longer
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
than that um but they're approved by the
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine for the length of
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
their residency the projected length of
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
their residency this change in statute
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
that requires every two-year renewal is
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
a change to to the status quo and we're
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
looking for Ru making Authority um or
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
for oplc to have rulemaking authority to
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
create a structure that would um allow
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
for some
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
flexibilities from the twoe you know
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
deviate from the two-year
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirement um follow follow um so
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
I'm confused as to how the bill is
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
written would accomplish that um it
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
references two rsas the first RSA deals
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
with training licenses that expire any
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
year and continues to say that in the
 
04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
same paragraph in fact the paragraph two
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
I believe in statute is the same here as
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
it is there with the exception that
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
we've added this one clause in and then
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
unless I'm mistaken and once again these
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
are all things that I'll feel really
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
silly if I'm wrong on but RSA
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
32992 that's referenced doesn't exist
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah 22 sorry doesn't exist um so there
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that um Doug from your
 
04:11:54.109 --> 04:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
cover it Doug Mr asra I apologize okay
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
very good all right other questions so
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not crazy you're not crazy thank
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
you all right I don't see any more
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
Deck good afternoon Douglas Hout PLC um
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
I did receive the office doesn't take a
 
04:12:17.550 --> 04:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
position on this bill either way um but
 
04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
I did receive a copy of an amendment the
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
executive director and Miss Tanner work
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
together um Lindsay and I had a
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday so that if the
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee decides to move forward we
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
would Rectify those kinds of things
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
because I also found problems with sort
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the bill as proposed uh I like I said
 
04:12:39.389 --> 04:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
I just got a copy of it this morning um
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
I will share that with the committee as
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
soon as I leave here today uh I do have
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
one paper copy wasn't intending to share
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
but basically it removes those statutory
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
requirements representative Brown to
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
your question earlier about
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
find um I I believe that just the
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
reference to the license type is enough
 
04:13:09.309 --> 04:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
and that's that's sort of what we did in
 
04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'll share that around and
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
then the the second part which
 
04:13:15.269 --> 04:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
referenced uh RSA 3299 We just cleaned
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
it up so everything should be consistent
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
with 310 1095 that we're doing this year
 
04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's my hope with this amendment um
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
and because I got it late I haven't had
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
a chance to share it yet okay
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
so is it your understanding that a
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
resident physician resident is different
 
04:13:35.429 --> 04:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
than than a physician
 
04:13:37.630 --> 04:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
license other than the
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
term that's what I'm
 
04:13:45.070 --> 04:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:47.550 --> 04:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
and do they have stat is there statutory
 
04:13:52.750 --> 04:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
license because if there isn't we need
 
04:13:57.149 --> 04:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
to fix that that's an excellent question
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
because if there isn't one then I don't
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
know how they would even be subject to
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Simon thank you
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah I mean that was I think
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
the one of the points I was trying to
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
drive at is neither of these well the
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
one doesn't exist at all anyway 22
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not in statute um so it's
 
04:14:21.870 --> 04:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
not referencing anything that I can see
 
04:14:24.670 --> 04:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
and then 32914 just deals with training
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
licenses as far as I can see it doesn't
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with residency
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
licenses it says training licenses for
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
people who are in residency but that's
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
as far as it goes so I was I was unable
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
to reconcile that are those terms
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
interchangeable I suppose is the
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
question I'd have to take a look at the
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
language in more detail and if I'll
 
04:14:43.149 --> 04:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
follow up you follow up and if it is the
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
training licenses are set for one year
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
to expire every one year as they still
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
are in this in the bill that we have in
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
anyway line five and those apprentices
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
licensed for one year in accordance with
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
rules adopted and that's the way it is
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
statute so that that that language for
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
the one year in accordance with rules
 
04:15:11.710 --> 04:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
that was language that was originally
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
meant to apply I believe to electrician
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
apprentice licenses yeah this is a
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
modification of that but that was a
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
reference to the electrician apprentices
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
that one year right these are not
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
Apprentice doctors no but if you go to
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
the RSA that it's referencing
 
04:15:30.990 --> 04:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
32914 I believe you'll see that it says
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
temporary or training licenses for
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
people in residency and apprentices for
 
04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:36.670 align:start position:0%
people in residency and apprentices for
one

04:15:36.670 --> 04:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
year once again I don't know I'm maybe
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one who's on this Trail but
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
oh no I I
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes oh follow up on
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
that brown under
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
32914 5 C it says training licenses
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
shall be confined to activities
 
04:15:57.149 --> 04:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
performed in the course of the
 
04:15:59.229 --> 04:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
qualifying residency shall expire
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
automatically upon the licy separation
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
from The Residency so that makes it as
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
long as
 
04:16:05.399 --> 04:16:06.950 align:start position:0%
long as
necessary

04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:16:10.030 --> 04:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
right until you're done with your
 
04:16:12.990 --> 04:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
residency if I I mean for two years
 
04:16:16.120 --> 04:16:16.130 align:start position:0%
except for residency licenses
 
04:16:16.130 --> 04:16:17.349 align:start position:0%
except for residency licenses
[Music]

04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:16:17.359 --> 04:16:19.389 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

04:16:19.389 --> 04:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
5c that's referenced in the bill at the
 
04:16:30.030 --> 04:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
end and under 5A is where it says the
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
board shall issue special training
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
licenses in a regular residency or
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.510 --> 04:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
program so correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
again it looks like it you have your
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
training your residency training license
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
that will continue until you're done
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
residency so it sounds like this bill is
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
not actually
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
needed except for the fact that the the
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
310 has a not withstanding any the other
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
section of law
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.359 --> 04:17:25.269 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
right right so this one is uh yeah oh
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's right so so basically this is
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
a it's implementing
 
04:17:39.790 --> 04:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
those that license and
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
saying it can be for for any duration up
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
residency and did we look at
 
04:17:57.630 --> 04:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
3299 3299 is that applicable as
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
well um
 
04:17:59.880 --> 04:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
well um
3294

04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
3294
 
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
Roman um oh sorry rep represent six
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
specifically says they can license is
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
limited to specific periods of time
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
residency so is it correct to say that
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
the main thing this bill wants to do is
 
04:18:29.149 --> 04:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the overreaching except two
 
04:18:29.159 --> 04:18:30.710 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the overreaching except two
two

04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
years uh regardless of any other statute
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
law is that correct that's my
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of it right so right
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
because under 310a all of the licensing
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
terms R PLC became two years except for
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
these apprentices license with the with
 
04:18:47.790 --> 04:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
the car rout that exists now and this
 
04:18:50.429 --> 04:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
would be an additional car rout so that
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
in rule we could establish the license
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
to be the duration of The Residency not
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily two
 
04:18:56.960 --> 04:18:59.309 align:start position:0%
necessarily two
years

04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:19:05.550 --> 04:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
or yes can someone can you confirm that
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a RSA 329 colon9 section 22
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
because if we do it's not and I know
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
this has happened
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
before so
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
um we just need to know what that is
 
04:19:29.640 --> 04:19:32.550 align:start position:0%
um we just need to know what that is
it's

04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
329 ah it's
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
new and
 
04:19:41.109 --> 04:19:41.119 align:start position:0%
in uhuh so that's Ru making
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
Authority okay correct correct it is Ru
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
making Authority that's what 3299 is and
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
it ends at at 21 so this is a new
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
22 so it just adds this to to it adds
 
04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
residencies to the long list of things
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
that are people that are already allowed
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
under Ru making under the statute right
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right now now we understand now
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
we can question whether we need this
 
04:20:11.109 --> 04:20:11.119 align:start position:0%
representative like us
 
04:20:14.269 --> 04:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
so um the amendment you're talking about
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
would it just change section or Roman 2
 
04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
section one Roman 2 and if
 
04:20:22.590 --> 04:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
so what would it say it's very short you
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
want me to just read it sure okay uh so
 
04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
section two would read licenses shall be
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
valid for two years from the date of
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
issuance except for physician residency
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
licenses and Apprentice licenses the
 
04:20:36.429 --> 04:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
duration of physician residency license
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
and Apprentice licenses shall be
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
established by the office in accordance
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
with 541a timely and complete
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
application for license renewal by
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
eligible applicants shall continue the
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
validity of the license being renewed
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
until the office has acted on the renal
 
04:20:53.309 --> 04:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
application and then the second piece
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
changes the sentence to remove the and
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
duration so the eligibility requirements
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
for phys residencies under RSA 329 colon
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
14 hard
 
04:21:06.000 --> 04:21:08.349 align:start position:0%
14 hard
stop

04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
followup okay so we have to look at the
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
language look at it closer but it seems
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
like it's taking the one year out so
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
leaving that up to Ru making for The
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
Apprentice licenses which you said were
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
electricians correct
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
um and again I'd have to follow yeah I I
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
agree how does who sets the duration of
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the resident license and
 
04:21:40.349 --> 04:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:43.710 --> 04:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
well Madam chair yes C of Physicians and
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
surgeons and it says the board shall so
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
it must be the medical board I'm
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
guessing that there is some hold over
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
language that 1095 is intending to clean
 
04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
up that would right there's places all
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
over statute where it says the board
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
issues the license Etc so that's what
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
our our bill is trying to
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
do on the other side clean up those
 
04:22:08.109 --> 04:22:08.119 align:start position:0%
conflicts right so the existing
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
language but
 
04:22:11.520 --> 04:22:14.670 align:start position:0%
language but
um

04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
does your Amendment address the rule the
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
rules for duration of licenses because
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
it'll be established in
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
rule you better have rule then you
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
better have rule making authority to do
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
that and that's what this amendment
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
would give us
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
or we have it for the processes this
 
04:22:34.760 --> 04:22:38.229 align:start position:0%
or we have it for the processes this
would

04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
clarify black us I think you're getting
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
another another simple Little Bill with
 
04:22:42.920 --> 04:22:44.469 align:start position:0%
another another simple Little Bill with
no

04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
problem the simplest things are
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
complicated I I think when you see the
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
language I mean depending on the policy
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
decision but it'll be kind of clear what
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
we did with the amendment okay so if I
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
can if any if any of you hear me say
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
something wrong to recap the board has
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to licence residents as
 
04:23:12.269 --> 04:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
residents for for as long as they want
 
04:23:12.279 --> 04:23:13.070 align:start position:0%
residents for for as long as they want
the

04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
oplc is taking over the licensing
 
04:23:20.189 --> 04:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility and will'll have rules
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
about it and this this exempts them from
 
04:23:23.439 --> 04:23:24.309 align:start position:0%
about it and this this exempts them from
the

04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
two-year renewal process is that is that
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
essentially what you're intending to do
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
I not me well but yeah I believe that's
 
04:23:38.109 --> 04:23:38.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill um I do want to
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
clarify the office already has the
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
ability to issue the license the board
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
is setting that criteria that was a 6x5
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
change right right right so right the
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
the off the board sets the
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
criteria the oplc issues the license and
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
we need this to exempt them from the two
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
years regardless okay thank you I think
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's give them the ru making Authority
 
04:24:02.239 --> 04:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
that's give them the ru making Authority
right

04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right just is briefly if you if
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
you can when you have the the language
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
yes sent it out and also take a look if
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's any conflict with 1095 or we'll
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
do that I got the language late this
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
morning so I just didn't have an
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share it but I'll do that
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
as soon as I get back all right thank
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
you and I expect we'll see you for the
 
04:24:26.720 --> 04:24:33.750 align:start position:0%
you and I expect we'll see you for the
licensing

04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%

all right I want to warn the committee
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
this is another short simple
 
04:45:16.270 --> 04:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%

04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%

04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
the pass Senator rard would be fine with
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
that um my name is Grant bosy pleased to

Senate Bill 369 uh 306 excuse me on
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator avard the prime
 
04:45:56.190 --> 04:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor s SP 306 shifts rulemaking
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
Authority for dispute resolution within
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
the board of manufactured housing from
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
the installation Standards Board to the
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure and
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
certification bringing the process in
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
line with recent statutory changes in
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
into compliance with the Federal
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
04:46:15.070 --> 04:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
Development last session the legislature
 
04:46:17.070 --> 04:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
transferred rulemaking over disciplinary
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
and non-disciplinary procedures in oplc
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
in both HB 655 and HB 409 sb36 is
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
consistent with this policy the bill
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
does not repeal the installation
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
Standards Board it just moves oplc in
 
04:46:35.230 --> 04:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
charge of drafting rules on manufactured
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
housing dispute resolution along with
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
its current similar duties I will defer
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions to director Courtney and her
 
04:46:43.310 --> 04:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
staff if there are questions they can't
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
answer which is rarely the case I'll
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
make sure Senator avard gets you an
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
answer Senator avard thanks you for your
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
consideration and support of sp36 thank
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
you uh actually I I have one question
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
that I hope you might be able to at
 
04:46:59.070 --> 04:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
least give us a clue to what kind of
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing disputes are you
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
talking about that are other than
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
complaints and
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
investigations against the people doing
 
04:47:07.320 --> 04:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
investigations against the people doing
the

04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.840 --> 04:47:12.548 align:start position:0%
 
installations

04:47:12.548 --> 04:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
installations
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
because if you're talking
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
about infr Park issues that's not
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
something I want to stick to the oplc
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
with I don't know I was asked to uh
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill a couple hours ago
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
and I am happy to pinch hit but I'll
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
have to take that pitch I'll make sure
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
to get you an answer thank you because
 
04:47:32.510 --> 04:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's I'm not sure what he's what
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
exactly he's talking
 
04:47:37.230 --> 04:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
about thank you for your testimony other
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
questions to be relay to senator aard
 
04:47:42.590 --> 04:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you for your
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
house good afternoon Douglas ster help
 
04:47:56.430 --> 04:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
for OPC we don't take a position on this
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question this is
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
separate from the complaint process the
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
history as far as I know or understand
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
it is it's supposed to be an alternative
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
a lowcost alternative to having to file
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
something in court
 
04:48:13.990 --> 04:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's sort of a hold over from
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
before they were with the
 
04:48:18.990 --> 04:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
oplc that's that's but what kind of
 
04:48:22.548 --> 04:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
they legal disputes I don't know the
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
answer to that question okay because
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
that that's the whole point if
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a question of somebody
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
saying they Pro inspect installed my
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured house and it leaks I would
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be a
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
complaint or would that be a dispute
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
does anybody does anybody represent
 
04:48:49.110 --> 04:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I'm as I
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
look at what's being repealed uh RSA 205
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
D20 uh
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
11 um that clarifies what it is so I'm
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
not sure we really want to repeal that
 
04:49:04.350 --> 04:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
or we maybe want to clarify what
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
resolution means because um 11 says the
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
establishment of a program for the
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
timely resolution of disputes between
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers retailers and installers
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing regarding
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the issuance of
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate orders and for the
 
04:49:22.190 --> 04:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
correction or repair of defects in
 
04:49:24.270 --> 04:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured houses that are reported
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
during the one-year period following the
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
date of installation so we may want to
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
have that somewhere in statute so we
 
04:49:32.110 --> 04:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
know what we're the dispute is we're
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
resolving here ah and I'm not sure where
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
we want to put
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
it so this is if somebody says my H my
 
04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
house leags and the person and the
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
installer says that's the way it came
 
04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
from the factory this deals with with
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
that issue that's what it appears on 11
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
the way I read it and if we repeal that
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
then there's really no definition of
 
04:49:56.590 --> 04:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
what the resolution is in
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
04:50:01.150 --> 04:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
you and I'll defer to the attorney on
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not I think that's a really
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
good point like what is this supposed to
 
04:50:05.548 --> 04:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
be addressing if we remove that
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
definition so so my understanding of it
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
in the impetus of this bill is that it's
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
just not happening the rules expired I
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
in April of
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
2022 the board has not to throw anybody
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
under the bus but been dragging their
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
feet on this there's also a question
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
about whether because it's a process if
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
it should even be with the board or
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
whether it should fall with the oplc we
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
um were given rule making Authority on
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary proceedings last year
 
04:50:39.548 --> 04:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
so to I think I think the executive
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
directors of the opinion we may already
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
have the statutory Authority I don't
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
know if I agree with her on that because
 
04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's entirely clear from
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
the language so this would would clarify
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
that the oplc would have that rulemaking
 
04:50:55.948 --> 04:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
Authority uh we would have to find a
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
location I think to figure out what this
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be doing now the other
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
the other piece to not having this in
 
04:51:08.670 --> 04:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
place is that there's a a federal
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
default so if the state doesn't have
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
rules we're using the federal process
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
which is what we have now I'm not
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
entirely familiar with that process but
 
04:51:19.708 --> 04:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I'm told it's terrible and
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
nobody likes it so we want our own State
 
04:51:27.990 --> 04:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
process back in just back in the game um
 
04:51:30.190 --> 04:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
the board did file a fiscal impact
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
statement back in January but they have
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
not filed an initial proposal yet and I
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't think they meet again until June
 
04:51:39.520 --> 04:51:42.670 align:start position:0%
don't think they meet again until June
13th

04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
so just putting that out there um we'd
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to take it on if you think
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the best decision with a smile
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
and um but we don't take a
 
04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
position thank you representative go
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
goie did you have something to add just
 
04:52:03.788 --> 04:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
want I want to follow up that I agree if
 
04:52:06.190 --> 04:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
we don't at least have some sort of
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
definition what a resolution is or this
 
04:52:10.628 --> 04:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
wording put back in somewhere that then
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
there's an issue okay represent
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
G because this all these issues are sort
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
of tangled up in my mind I'm trying to
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
last year we had a bill to discuss
 
04:52:26.160 --> 04:52:29.230 align:start position:0%
last year we had a bill to discuss
manufactured

04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.430 --> 04:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
housing was it and that we we repeal
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
that in House Bill too correct no
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
separate boards there's manufactured
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
housing and there's the installation
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
board it's very confusing and what
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
happened to the housing board that's
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
gone what I'm talking about is the
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
installation Standards Board corre
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay so that other board which
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
was the one that was I think the one
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about within a
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
park that board is gone so we've already
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
decided we're not going to we're not
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
part of that so this is more like a
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
technical board is that what you're
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
saying this board deals with the
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
inspection and certification of
 
04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing standards that is
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
did they install it correctly on the
 
04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
right kind of
 
04:53:19.230 --> 04:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
Foundations and there's dis this allows
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
for disputes with the manufacturer
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
retailers and installers which may or
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
may not be triggered by a complaint okay
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
I think I've been enlightened on this so
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
apparently we
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
accidentally repealed the dispute
 
04:53:35.360 --> 04:53:37.190 align:start position:0%
accidentally repealed the dispute
resolution

04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
board which is required by Hud
 
04:53:42.548 --> 04:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
and I remember this
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
conversation this is I remember that
 
04:53:48.150 --> 04:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
conversation and we need in order if we
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't have this board then our program
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
is no longer in compliance with the
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
federal program I mean this is this is
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
starting to ring a bell and I think we
 
04:54:01.070 --> 04:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
need to in order for that to happen
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it fixes that
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
repeal that we shouldn't have had but I
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
agree that we shouldn't repeal the rest
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
of it either because that's what that's
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
where all the
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
information is defines
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility installation standard
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
board is still a board that exists in
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
meets they have a meeting scheduled for
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
June 13th yeah so what we what we need
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
to avoid the HUD process is our own
 
04:54:26.040 --> 04:54:27.270 align:start position:0%
to avoid the HUD process is our own
State

04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
process not necessarily a
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
border and the the
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
note the description of the bill says
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're repe repealing the fees but
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
that's only Roman 7 Roman 10 and
 
04:54:40.878 --> 04:54:42.670 align:start position:0%
that's only Roman 7 Roman 10 and
11

04:54:42.670 --> 04:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
11
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
are are not the fee 10 is hearing how to
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
conduct hearings which I think all all
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
see already has but the program for
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution is not in um not
 
04:55:02.430 --> 04:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere else as far as I know so I just
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm sorry excuse me
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
please follow up first sorry um so I
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure what you're
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
saying is if we have have our own State
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
program we don't need the HUD program we
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
default out of it correct and whose
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
decision I mean what whose policy
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
decision is that oh it's in the cfrs I
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
don't have that reference right in front
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
of me but it it says if you don't have
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
a if the states have their own process
 
04:55:32.470 --> 04:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to follow the HUD
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
process that's that's our
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
decision that's the policy
 
04:55:41.948 --> 04:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
decision pleas finish R bro and then rep
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that if we
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
pass this bill we're agreeing that we
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
don't want want to be part of the HUD
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
process but if we do want to be part of
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
process do I have it backwards I think
 
04:55:58.510 --> 04:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
want if you if we pass this bill we're
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
we're providing an alternative to the
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
HUD process if we kill it there doesn't
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
appear to be one okay correct then it's
 
04:56:10.750 --> 04:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
important that we pass
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
I mean technically we still need to
 
04:56:12.320 --> 04:56:13.270 align:start position:0%
I mean technically we still need to
build

04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
out yes I was just going to point out
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
this what we're looking at is an amended
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
version the original Senate Bill 306 the
 
04:56:32.948 --> 04:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
title was reinstating the board of
 
04:56:32.958 --> 04:56:35.150 align:start position:0%
title was reinstating the board of
manufactured

04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
04:56:38.948 --> 04:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
housing ah which apparently this we
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want the Senate didn't want
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
so okay so so this is reinstating a
 
04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
small piece of board of manufactured
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
housing under the office okay
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
right excuse me
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mr bossy you have
 
04:57:01.830 --> 04:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
a please uh I think we need to hear
 
04:57:09.150 --> 04:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.160 --> 04:57:11.868 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
so just to provide a little bit of
 
04:57:16.510 --> 04:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
background the decision on the uh the
 
04:57:18.030 --> 04:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
underlying board that was a subject of
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
the introduced bill has been
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
controversial Senators have disagreed on
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
this Senator rard was not on the
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
prevailing side of last year's Bill he
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
brought in a bill to try to undo that
 
04:57:31.390 --> 04:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
decision he could not count to 13 and
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
decided to use this bill for another
 
04:57:33.920 --> 04:57:35.948 align:start position:0%
decided to use this bill for another
amendment

04:57:35.948 --> 04:57:35.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
you represent black
 
04:57:41.680 --> 04:57:43.788 align:start position:0%
you represent black
us

04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:57:46.110 --> 04:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
so as I've heard more in reading through
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
it and this I'm going to ask Doug if he
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
agrees so it is sort of a question um
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking the bill as it stands might
 
04:57:54.520 --> 04:57:55.548 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking the bill as it stands might
be

04:57:55.548 --> 04:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay because what it's getting rid of in
 
04:57:59.000 --> 04:58:00.310 align:start position:0%
okay because what it's getting rid of in
205

04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
205
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
D20 is yeah there's
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
the the fees which is fine uh procedure
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
for conducting
 
04:58:09.868 --> 04:58:09.878 align:start position:0%
hearings which is fine and then the main
 
04:58:12.750 --> 04:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
one is 11 which is the establishment of
 
04:58:14.708 --> 04:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
a program for timely resolution of
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
um that's the one that gets into what
 
04:58:24.190 --> 04:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
the disputes could and actually I may
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
just decide what I just said was wrong
 
04:58:28.190 --> 04:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
about it being fine as it is I mean we
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
might need to
 
04:58:36.430 --> 04:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
take something like 11 ex Roman XI and
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
and put it in the bill somehow to
 
04:58:41.948 --> 04:58:41.958 align:start position:0%
indicate what kind of
 
04:58:45.390 --> 04:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
complaints we want oplc to deal with so
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
that might be the way to do
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
um speaking to
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
205d uh 2011 uh the establishment of a
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
program for timely resolution of
 
04:59:04.548 --> 04:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
disputes does that exist did they create
 
04:59:08.910 --> 04:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
that would be the manufactured that
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
expired in it wasn't Rule and it expired
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
in April of 2022 of 2022 okay so we have
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
nothing is what okay we have that was
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%

normally on the amendment if the initial
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill is just being done away with it
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%

you we only see what's left after the uh
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
after the amendment has taken
 
05:00:00.590 --> 05:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
place yes and it never changes the
 
05:00:02.590 --> 05:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors which is why you're going to
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
see our representative Gallagher
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
presenting sponsoring a bill to
 
05:00:13.548 --> 05:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh rewrite oplc
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
essentially yes
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you again so this is where
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
my brain was going I just didn't know
 
05:00:24.030 --> 05:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
yet so um they expired in 2022 April
 
05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
2022 why did they not renew
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
it we don't
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
know great question I'll have to take it
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
back and ask a member of the
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
board I don't know I know they I mean
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
I can say they have been working on
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
rules on this but I feel like I could
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
have been saying that a while back and
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
again they submitted a fist to OSS a
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement in January
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's no IP submitted they don't meet
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
again until June 13th so my expectation
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
without having an opportunity to speak
 
05:01:02.670 --> 05:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
to a member of the board is that that
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
would be the soonest they would even
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
file the IP if the board's meeting
 
05:01:08.350 --> 05:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
sounds like the board's meeting
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
quarterly at best correct and they don't
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
really deal with it very well yeah if I
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
um yeah just to clarify for myself
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
whether it was um because we're just
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
cleaning things up the way that we've
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
been cleaning them up to make them
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
consistent or whether or not we're
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
filling in the blanks for a board that's
 
05:01:27.070 --> 05:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
just not doing what it should be
 
05:01:29.390 --> 05:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
doing maybe a little of column A a
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
little of column B because I also see in
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
light of what happened last year with
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
655 where the office was given all the
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
procedural this is something that slides
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
right into that very neatly I I think
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
which is why we are absolutely happy to
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
take it on if that's the committee's
 
05:01:48.430 --> 05:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
decision where and just I want to go
 
05:01:51.868 --> 05:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
back to the repeal do we want to repeal
 
05:01:55.230 --> 05:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
these sections because I don't think we
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
do I think we want to repeal two of them
 
05:02:00.990 --> 05:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
the third one we might want to leave or
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
relocate it to somewhere else
 
05:02:08.070 --> 05:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
represent black and goalie I think um
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
think we it it's under the installation
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
housing board if we're going to give the
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
authority to oplc I would say we we keep
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
the repeal as it is but we're going to
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
have to take at least some variant on
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
Section 11 of 205 D20 and put it in this
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
thing at least to give them some
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
guidance on their ruling correct correct
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
believe that yeah okay so so we're in
 
05:02:32.590 --> 05:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
agreement that if we decide to implement
 
05:02:32.600 --> 05:02:34.628 align:start position:0%
agreement that if we decide to implement
this

05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:02:37.230 --> 05:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
program that Roman 11 needs to be
 
05:02:39.070 --> 05:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
repealed because it's a wrong place but
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
the content needs needs to be put back
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else more
 
05:02:45.628 --> 05:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay we
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
will what about just a reference to the
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
CFR right at the manufactured housing
 
05:02:53.230 --> 05:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
dispute resolation pursuant to CFR
 
05:02:54.750 --> 05:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the citation is we could find
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
it and plug it in there do we I'm sure
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
we will take that into consideration in
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
the sub commmittee
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know any uh any
 
05:03:07.000 --> 05:03:08.750 align:start position:0%
um I don't know any uh any
volunteers

05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
05:03:08.760 --> 05:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
volunteers
um

05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:16.350 --> 05:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
who's that doesn't have
 
05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
one well it it's really uh it will be
 
05:03:24.030 --> 05:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%

her organization because it really is
 
05:03:34.030 --> 05:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with the impacts of the
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
oplc changes that we've
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%

that's fine and so basically um as we
discussed

05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
earlier um
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
um instead of naming particular
 
05:05:42.958 --> 05:05:44.948 align:start position:0%
um instead of naming particular
certification

05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
organizations it's going to leave it to
 
05:05:49.868 --> 05:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
um there must be a reference to rule
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
making somewhere in the Bill yes it's
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's on line nine of the bill it's not
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the amendment it's unchanged right uh
 
05:05:57.120 --> 05:05:58.868 align:start position:0%
in the amendment it's unchanged right uh
actually

05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
line as amended by the Senate looks like
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
line 14 oh you're right
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah so that okay right so that it
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
would leave uh it up to oplc to decide
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
which certification programs are well to
 
05:06:17.788 --> 05:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
the rul making process which is oplc and
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else who gets involved in it
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
um which I think is a lot better than
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
specifying particular ones that tends to
 
05:06:23.760 --> 05:06:24.750 align:start position:0%
specifying particular ones that tends to
lead

05:06:24.750 --> 05:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
lead
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
to problems because if nothing else
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
those things change over time sometimes
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
okay represent bro you wish to speak to

05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
all I think we've said it all unless
 
05:07:48.510 --> 05:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
someone has other issues with it okay
 
05:07:48.520 --> 05:07:49.470 align:start position:0%
someone has other issues with it okay

Simon well Madam chair I would just say
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the music therapist
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't pass this year this might
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
be a an alternative way to go about
 
05:07:57.200 --> 05:07:58.350 align:start position:0%
be a an alternative way to go about
doing

05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:08:01.230 --> 05:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a a good model where
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
we don't have to put full VI insure in
 
05:08:04.270 --> 05:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
place but they can still get what they
 
05:08:04.280 --> 05:08:05.788 align:start position:0%
place but they can still get what they
need

05:08:05.788 --> 05:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:08:05.798 --> 05:08:08.430 align:start position:0%
need
for

05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:08:08.440 --> 05:08:10.430 align:start position:0%
for
insurance

05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good point this is a
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
a purely
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh certification that uh one
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
can get or
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
not all right any um other comments
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions concerns represent
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
Gart just as far as the new hiring that
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
the oplc will be required to implement
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
this I don't know why $100,000 was stuck
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind but this is saying program
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
assistant to to it goes up to 73,000 in
 
05:08:44.590 --> 05:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2027 but what I'm having an
 
05:08:47.470 --> 05:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
issue with is the numbers so the Dual
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
licensing on the bottom in the fiscal
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
note it'll say 30 licenses at $300 and
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
every two years of renews and then until
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
2027 they say 34 licenses and then for
 
05:08:59.070 --> 05:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
the lactation service provider there's
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
50 licenses to begin with and then it
 
05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
claims there'll be 60 licenses two years
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
later in 2027 but from the testimony we
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
received there was 221 clc's in the
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
state so
 
05:09:12.430 --> 05:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
is this to say that there's only going
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
to be a fraction of the actual available
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
people that go through the certification
 
05:09:18.350 --> 05:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
or by point being is we're looking at a
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
$50,000 difference between what the
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
license fees bring in and what it's
 
05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
going to cost implement this now does it
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
make sense or no I missing something yes
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
it's a valid question the thing is that
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary
 
05:09:34.110 --> 05:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
certification and for example the clc's
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
who are working in the wi Wick offices
 
05:09:40.510 --> 05:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
under 100% federal funds don't need need
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
a license someone that is already
 
05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
licensed as a nurse may not or a PA or
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
whatever may not need an additional
 
05:09:55.030 --> 05:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
license or additional certification if
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
they've got the um so there there may be
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
fewer than there are fewer
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
certifications given out than there are
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
actual practitioners okay follow up then
 
05:10:10.270 --> 05:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
the would now oplc is self funded right
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the fees pay for the salaries so would
 
05:10:13.868 --> 05:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
this not be
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
a would this not be penalizing other
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
license holders now to cover that
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
difference am I missing and I understand
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the oplc is in the process of revising
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
its license fees and the $300 for
 
05:10:30.548 --> 05:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
example is an estimate it's not not set
 
05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
Sone we have we haven't we're not
 
05:10:34.830 --> 05:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
specifying what the license has to be
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
they can figure it out depending on the
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
number of applicants so it would balance
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
out to cover that at least it should it
 
05:10:44.430 --> 05:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
the goal is that they should cover a
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more than their direct
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
cost represent leus and then represent
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
Simon yeah this is um related I
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
mean and I don't know if anyone here can
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
answer it um but it's saying they're
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
going to need additional
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
staff but I would think that would
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
depend on how many people actually asked
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
for this so I I assume they'll sort that
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
out but I mean
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
if if they these staff costs and their
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
estimate of the number of people they
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
would have to drastically increase the
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
licensing fee I would think to pay for
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
it I mean like a lot like more than 10
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
times 3,000 I
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
mean yes that's it seems it it does seem
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
like consistent I don't know if that's
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
yeah Douglas oer how oplc I think this
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
is kind of a worst case scenario fiscal
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
Network sheet we don't know how many
 
05:11:43.548 --> 05:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
people we're going to get and depending
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
on what the turnout is we may need
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
somebody we may not but I wouldn't see
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
it taking more than one extra
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
position so this is the maximum I would
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
think so maximum expenses minimum
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue what a followup on that followup
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes but I mean it's showing here let's
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
say for
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
25 24,000 in revenue and over 69,000 in
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
cost so it mean you're going to have to
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's looking like $800 licensing fees
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
or something crazy like that unless if
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
happens that's something we're going to
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
consider I I mean I don't have I don't
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you right now on that
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
right but we have we have the fee
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
setting Authority in the
 
05:12:29.070 --> 05:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
102s um if we get this
 
05:12:31.150 --> 05:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
Certification depending on the turnout
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of work
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
involved we may have to hire an
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
additional person and if the boards are
 
05:12:40.350 --> 05:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
required to cover their costs uh
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
then fees are probably going to have to
 
05:12:41.878 --> 05:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
then fees are probably going to have to
go

05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
up black can can I also say one more
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not the finance guy okay so
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
take everything I'm saying with a grain
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
of salt please I do know that the oplc
 
05:13:00.910 --> 05:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
has fee setting Authority and I was
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
Lindsay is in the process of revising
 
05:13:05.948 --> 05:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
the fees for the different Prof
 
05:13:07.708 --> 05:13:07.718 align:start position:0%
profession they're breaking it out more
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
accurately than the office spends so
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
much and there's so many licenses that's
 
05:13:16.990 --> 05:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
$155 each you're breaking it down more
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh more specifically to which boards
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
charge what okay follow up follow up
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
there so I mean if they have to hire
 
05:13:26.110 --> 05:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that it doesn't necessarily
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
mean 100% of their time is going to be
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
on this it could do other things they
 
05:13:30.548 --> 05:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to cover all of that
 
05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
position cor there's there's very few
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
people who are devoted to just one board
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
or one license
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
type good timing
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
speak of the devil represent simonk you
 
05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair since this is a voluntary
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
license it wouldn't be spread out over
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
everybody correct but that wouldn't be
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
spread out over all C see it's just
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
people who are getting the voluntary
 
05:13:58.110 --> 05:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
license and my assumption would be that
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
um they would have to make a cost
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis for themselves if if
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
getting money from Medicaid is worth it
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
to them then they'll pay the $300 to get
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement out of it it's a it's
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
cost for right now they can't get that
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
money at all so it's cost cost benefit
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
analysis okay represent Gard just for
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
curiosity sake has there ever been a s i
 
05:14:20.430 --> 05:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
mean somebody on that's been on this
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee for longer might know this has
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
there ever been a voluntary license that
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
any I've only been here for 16
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
years Madam yes representative Simon I I
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
mean just from a philosophical
 
05:14:45.548 --> 05:14:45.558 align:start position:0%
theoretical standpoint I would say the
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
process for doing that would be no
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
different than going from no license to
 
05:14:49.868 --> 05:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
a full license it's still going to have
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
to come back in front of us correct yes
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have to vote on it
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
it would still have to pass it to the
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislature still so it's not like a it
 
05:14:58.110 --> 05:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
might be like a from a philosophical
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint oh well we already have this
 
05:15:01.470 --> 05:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's an camel's nose Under the Tent as
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
we like to say um but it's it would
 
05:15:05.910 --> 05:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
require the same process as it as it
 
05:15:05.920 --> 05:15:07.110 align:start position:0%
require the same process as it as it
does

05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
now okay
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent Brown thank you
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
so is it possible that if if this passes
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
as it is and oplc has the right to
 
05:15:24.548 --> 05:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
change that price for the license that
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
then the cost benefit analysis would
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
then drive all these people that wanted
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.670 --> 05:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
decision yes it's possible thank
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
you unlikely but possible okay all right
 
05:15:40.040 --> 05:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
you unlikely but possible okay all right
representative

05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
Goldie want to question the fact
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
that it says
 
05:15:54.510 --> 05:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
that in order to
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh create the uh a new obligation for
 
05:15:59.708 --> 05:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
oplc certify individuals and two
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
occupational things to administer this
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
May and and when I look at the numbers
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
down below for 30 lenses the high and I
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
continue to question that that for 30
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
lenses that's 80 sorry there's that's 30
 
05:16:22.590 --> 05:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
duelist plus 50 cation people for 80
 
05:16:25.470 --> 05:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're still looking at substantial fee
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
because that's that's only covering the
 
05:16:28.270 --> 05:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
assistant never mind everything else
 
05:16:30.510 --> 05:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
on do they really state that they need
 
05:16:37.310 --> 05:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
that position if we do this
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
program or should it may have to
 
05:16:44.670 --> 05:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
director Courtney can you help us with
 
05:16:47.548 --> 05:16:47.558 align:start position:0%
this so I think the CH lindsy Cory
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
oplc um So currently we allocate
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
um most of the expenses I I take a step
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
back most of the expenses would likely
 
05:17:01.150 --> 05:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
be related to licensing and per and
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
Licensing only um until we started to
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
see whether or not they're um using
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement related resources
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
so right now we have um a shared cost
 
05:17:15.670 --> 05:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
model as it relates to licensing
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
resources there are handful of boards
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
that have dedicated staff just given the
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
volume um but what we're seeing is that
 
05:17:25.510 --> 05:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
as we add on additional licensing
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and more licensing
 
05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
requirements our staff our existing
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
staff can only handle so much so it is
 
05:17:33.750 --> 05:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
possible that we would need an
 
05:17:37.150 --> 05:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
additional resource it is also possible
 
05:17:40.110 --> 05:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
given the volume which we have no clue
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
how many people would seek
 
05:17:45.548 --> 05:17:45.558 align:start position:0%
certification that that cost could be
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
shared um with other license types um
 
05:17:51.430 --> 05:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear at this point because
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
we just have no knowledge of of who
 
05:17:55.030 --> 05:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
would seek
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
certification and I think we just wanted
 
05:18:00.670 --> 05:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
to capture um for transparency purposes
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
maybe May was the better approach um but
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
I think we wanted to capture that
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
additional staff support could be
 
05:18:07.760 --> 05:18:10.868 align:start position:0%
additional staff support could be
needed

05:18:10.868 --> 05:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you represent Simon you
 
05:18:16.110 --> 05:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a comment yeah unless I'm wrong I
 
05:18:17.830 --> 05:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
mean just because it says would need
 
05:18:19.230 --> 05:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they have to right
 
05:18:20.830 --> 05:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
you're not obligated to just because it
 
05:18:20.840 --> 05:18:24.470 align:start position:0%
you're not obligated to just because it
says

05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
W it's a it's just the fiscal not right
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not we're not um we're not
 
05:18:35.310 --> 05:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
actually was it authorizing any funding
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
or any position so uh we're just being
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
warned that it might require some right
 
05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right any further comments
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.750 --> 05:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
correct it's pity all the important
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
stuff seems to go over onto the back
 
05:19:00.990 --> 05:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
page any other
 
05:19:03.310 --> 05:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
comments all right in that case the
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%

05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
Senate here to introduce Senate Bill 486
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Senator Pearl the Bill's
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor many Healthcare Providers
 
05:20:37.548 --> 05:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
enjoy the benefits of participating in
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
multi-state compact Acts including
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians nurses psychologists physical

therapists speech therapists
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists and counselors s
 
05:20:49.470 --> 05:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
sp46 would adopt a similar compact for
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
physician assistance this is part of the
 
05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort much of it coming through
 
05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
this committee to streamline the
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing process in New
 
05:20:59.708 --> 05:20:59.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without sacrificing patient
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
safety we're a small state so no one is
 
05:21:04.190 --> 05:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
very far from a border this bill will
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier for PAs to practice in
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
more than one state helping to attract
 
05:21:11.708 --> 05:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
and retain skilled healthcare workers
 
05:21:13.390 --> 05:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont New York and Rhode Island
 
05:21:15.948 --> 05:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
are considering PA compact legislation
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
this year so far five states have
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
already adopted the compact two more set
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
to sign by the end of the week thus
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
seven states is the minimum required for
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
the PA licensure compact to go live
 
05:21:28.910 --> 05:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
passing this bill now would get New
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in at the beginning of the
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
compact giving the granite state a role
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
in the initial rules governing the
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
agreement to be clear the bill does not
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
change the scope of PA practice in New
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other state only the
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
legislature and Board of Medicine can do
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
that any PA from another state would
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
still be held to all applicable New
 
05:21:49.708 --> 05:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws and regulations New
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would still have the authority
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
and ability to investigate outof State
 
05:21:56.270 --> 05:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
Pas practicing under the compact license
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
I will defer questions to the subject
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
matter experts here today if you have
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
any questions that they can't answer
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure Senator Pearl gets you an
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
answer Senator Pearl thanks you for your
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
consideration and support of Senate Bill
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
486 thank you
 
05:22:09.760 --> 05:22:10.510 align:start position:0%
486 thank you
thank

05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:22:10.520 --> 05:22:13.150 align:start position:0%
thank
you

05:22:13.150 --> 05:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions no I think Cas you're off the
 
05:22:24.910 --> 05:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
Perry chair members of the committee for
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
the record Warren Perry Deputy agent
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
General New Hampshire's Department of
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and V and services
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
again I'll be brief uh the department of
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
sees these compacts as an advantage for
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
the military Community for two reasons
 
05:22:41.788 --> 05:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
one it increases the portability of
 
05:22:46.030 --> 05:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
licenses for uh for military members and
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
their families who move to New Hampshire
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
who might be Physicians assistants and
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
two it has a potential to increase the
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
number of providers in the state to care
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the service members veterans and
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
families of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll end my testimony and
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
allow the committee to get on with its
 
05:23:04.390 --> 05:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
great work and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions that uh you may have okay
 
05:23:09.868 --> 05:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I repres
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
go thank you madam chair
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
um doesn't we heard Senate Bill 485
 
05:23:20.910 --> 05:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
addressing uh military spouses and
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
service members and
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing wouldn't that
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
suffice I I think it would except this
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
would uh it would in some instances and
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not in others right so I think
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the real Crux of 485 uh that we
 
05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
heard earlier today if I get the numbers
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
right is uh if they only they allow the
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
digital verifications of Licensing so it
 
05:23:50.910 --> 05:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean they would be
 
05:23:52.190 --> 05:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
the state would be participating in a
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
compact which would be a little bit
 
05:23:57.070 --> 05:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
different right so we would say I think
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
485 is more about issuing permanent
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:24:04.590 --> 05:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
by verifying with a digital means this
 
05:24:08.110 --> 05:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
is allowing Physicians assistants to
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed in multiple States
 
05:24:12.430 --> 05:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
so I think there's some Nuance there I
 
05:24:13.750 --> 05:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that I don't think it's
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
redundant there may be some overlap but
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think the two bills are
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
redundant thank you other
 
05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:24:26.670 --> 05:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
Simon for Physicians assistance in
 
05:24:28.350 --> 05:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
particular what would be the necessity
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
to be licensed in multiple States at the
 
05:24:34.510 --> 05:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
same time for veterans in
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
particular I just think it increases the
 
05:24:38.590 --> 05:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
you know the ability to practice right
 
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
so if they like like uh you know Mr
 
05:24:42.910 --> 05:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
bossy had mentioned earlier if all the
 
05:24:44.350 --> 05:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
border states have them we could
 
05:24:45.990 --> 05:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
practice across state lines I think
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
there anyone else thank you very
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.320 --> 05:25:17.510 align:start position:0%

um I'm here on uh this after on behalf
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
of nispa and over the over a thousand
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%

Health Sciences nispa supports s486
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
which would have New Hampshire join the
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
PA licensure Compact and we did submit a
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
letter for the
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
record I know this committee has heard
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
plenty about Pas over the last few weeks
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and now has a firm grip on the thousands
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
of hours of rigorous education training
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
required of a PA before they're
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
certified and licensed in New Hampshire
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
and state Nationwide and the committee
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
now knows how PA practice in medicine in
 
05:26:13.230 --> 05:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
modern collaborative Healthcare teams in
 
05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%

uh workplace clinics throughout the
 
05:26:21.868 --> 05:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
state and the nation we also serve in
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
the nation's uniform uh services and
 
05:26:25.470 --> 05:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
work for other federal government

agencies such as the Department of
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
Veteran Affairs s SP 486 is the final
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
piece of the parody puzzle for Pas U as
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
it would have Pas join other healthcare
 
05:26:36.110 --> 05:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
providers who enjoy the benefits of
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
Multistate multi-state licensure
 
05:26:40.110 --> 05:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
compacts including Physicians and nurses
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
Nisa is thrilled to have Carl here in
 
05:26:43.230 --> 05:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
person to testify in more detail and
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
address concerns raised by the committee
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
on other compact bills for other
 
05:26:49.750 --> 05:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
provider groups but I won't go into the
 
05:26:51.628 --> 05:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
details since they already um talked
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
about the uh you the benefits of the
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
Compact and what it would do so I'll
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
spare you the details to say that all
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
over again since start been presented to
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
you once already um but I'll uh pass it
 
05:27:04.190 --> 05:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.910 --> 05:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
now chair McGuire and members of the
 
05:27:08.510 --> 05:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Carl Sim I'm a
 
05:27:10.110 --> 05:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
deputy program director with the council
 
05:27:11.708 --> 05:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
state governments the council state
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
governments is a nonpartisan membership
 
05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
organization that serves the three
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
branches of state governments uh
 
05:27:18.150 --> 05:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for interstate compacts
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
provide policy support to states on the
 
05:27:22.510 --> 05:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
consideration of interstate compacts uh
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
as well as helping with the
 
05:27:25.868 --> 05:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
administration of them as well for the
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
PA compact I just wanted to note a few
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
things but I primarily want to be here
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
as a resource for the committee to
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that they might
 
05:27:35.230 --> 05:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
have uh but I would want to note that
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
the PA compact is similar in Form and
 
05:27:38.948 --> 05:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
Function to several the other compacts
 
05:27:40.470 --> 05:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is a member of
 
05:27:41.910 --> 05:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
including the counseling compact
 
05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy and the physical
 
05:27:46.510 --> 05:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
therapy compact also like to note that
 
05:27:48.750 --> 05:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
the PA compact like other ler compacts
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
enhances public protection by providing
 
05:27:53.270 --> 05:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
for a specific mechanism through a data
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
system by which compact member states
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
May communicate about their ly
 
05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
information to share information and
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
particularly with anything with adverse
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
actions or disciplinary investigative
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
information allowing States a a quick
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
and seamless way to be able to
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
communicate so that if actions need to
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
be taken in their specific State uh they
 
05:28:13.628 --> 05:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
may do so in expeditious manner also
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
would like to note that the PA compact
 
05:28:18.430 --> 05:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
can be complimentary to other leure
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
portability policies that states might
 
05:28:22.750 --> 05:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
have um so where other leure portability
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
policies are namely there to help
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
support for those who want to practice
 
05:28:30.670 --> 05:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
in a state a compact helps those uh
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners who wish to provide their
 
05:28:33.788 --> 05:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
service in the state but also helps your
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
existing lenses as well to be able to uh
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
practice in other compact member states
 
05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh in a more expeditious and streamlined
 
05:28:43.030 --> 05:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
manner uh again I would like to you know
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
be here as a resource for the committee
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
for any questions so um happy to do so
 
05:28:48.590 --> 05:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you the committee for their
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr representative Simon
 
05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so we passed a
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill through the house last week or the
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
week before um dealing with the um
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
supervisory agreements that are required
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
for Pas at the moment the the future of
 
05:29:07.628 --> 05:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
that bill is still uncertain it's
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
heading to the
 
05:29:09.868 --> 05:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
Senate we don't know what the government
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
Governor would do it if those agreements
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
were still in place would the ability to
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
cross state lines for Pas and practice
 
05:29:18.670 --> 05:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
in different states at the same times
 
05:29:20.830 --> 05:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
complicate the ability for PAs to get
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
those supervisory agreements would they
 
05:29:24.830 --> 05:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
be less attractive to positions um
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they'd be liable in multiple
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
States I can say that for the purpose of
 
05:29:31.470 --> 05:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
the compact it it mirrors how states are
 
05:29:33.788 --> 05:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
currently regulating PA so knowing that
 
05:29:35.948 --> 05:29:35.958 align:start position:0%
there's differences across States about
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
um collaboration agreements super
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
provision require requirements Pas are
 
05:29:40.190 --> 05:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
already having to abide by those
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
differences in laws so what the pa
 
05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
compact does is it provides a a
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
streamline manner for them to be able to
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um be able to apply for practice in
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
other compact member states provides a
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism so they can um understand
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
those differences in state laws so for
 
05:29:56.948 --> 05:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
example compact member states can make
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
as a requirement that Pas take and pass
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
a jurist Prudence exam uh so they can
 
05:30:05.628 --> 05:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
differences follow up follow up so just
 
05:30:11.110 --> 05:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
in case I didn't follow there correctly
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
like all the way through um are you un
 
05:30:15.990 --> 05:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you addressed as what
 
05:30:17.470 --> 05:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying are you unsure as to whether
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
or not it would make it less attractive
 
05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
for Physicians to sign those
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreements because they're
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to be working across state lines
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
under multiple
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions does the compact cover
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
that essentially the compact would only
 
05:30:35.070 --> 05:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
allow for obtaining compact privilege it
 
05:30:37.548 --> 05:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change how the PA if a PA comes
 
05:30:40.110 --> 05:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts and they apply for
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
compact privilege in New Hampshire they
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
would still have to then abide by the
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
state law in New Hampshire so if it say
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
h1222 doesn't pass they would still have
 
05:30:50.788 --> 05:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
to then find a physician to sign that
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
form um
 
05:30:55.390 --> 05:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
so that that would be the same hurdle
 
05:30:57.150 --> 05:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
that we're facing now whether you get a
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
compact privilege or not or if you're
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
actually in New Hampshire trying to work
 
05:31:01.948 --> 05:31:01.958 align:start position:0%
you still have to make sure that you're
 
05:31:03.788 --> 05:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
employer or you have to find your own
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
collaborating physician so the compact
 
05:31:06.990 --> 05:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change wouldn't make it I don't
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
think it would make it harder would just
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
present more Pas that would be licensed
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
or privileged in the state that would
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
then have to find a physician to sign
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
their form does that answer your
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
question or I can represent broa and
 
05:31:18.120 --> 05:31:19.230 align:start position:0%
question or I can represent broa and
then

05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:31:22.190 --> 05:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
goalie so my understanding of a compact
 
05:31:25.150 --> 05:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
is that those states that are early
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
participator who participate early in
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
the program are the ones that set the
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
criteria and the requirements for the
 
05:31:35.110 --> 05:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
compact for the compact license so I
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
05:31:36.840 --> 05:31:38.510 align:start position:0%
don't believe
that

05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:40.110 --> 05:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking and what you're saying
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
is in is in Conflict so my understanding
 
05:31:44.470 --> 05:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
is that the compact would set the
 
05:31:46.590 --> 05:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
requirement and if the compact
 
05:31:50.190 --> 05:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
requirement was that Pas had to signed
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreements then the P that
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
are in New Hampshire who want to be part
 
05:31:58.270 --> 05:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
of the compact would have to have
 
05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreements mean they would
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
have to be or it could be the other way
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to have a
 
05:32:06.910 --> 05:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement so this is where
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
I think we need to this out because I I
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
we're seeing two different things I mean
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
of our knowledge of compacts those
 
05:32:14.320 --> 05:32:16.150 align:start position:0%
of our knowledge of compacts those
states

05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
that for example it says that currently
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
five states have adopted the compact
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
right what we don't
 
05:32:28.470 --> 05:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
know um is we don't know how many states
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
oh it says seven states need to enact
 
05:32:33.628 --> 05:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
the Compact and once that compact is
 
05:32:36.310 --> 05:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
enacted those seven states get together
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
and write the licensing criteria and the
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
criteria for having a licensed
 
05:32:44.830 --> 05:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
compact is that correct I mean that's
 
05:32:46.830 --> 05:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
the way we understand it yes thank you
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the question so in the compact
 
05:32:50.430 --> 05:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that defines the parameters
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
at which the commission can operate
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking so it dictates what
 
05:32:56.590 --> 05:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
the state requirements are to join as
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
well as what the individual requirements
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
are for a PA to use the compact if they
 
05:33:02.270 --> 05:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
are in a compact member State the
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
compact commission which is made up of
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives um licensing board
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
administrators or board members from
 
05:33:10.990 --> 05:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
compact member states they can engage in
 
05:33:13.470 --> 05:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
Ru making uh but it must be narrowly
 
05:33:15.190 --> 05:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
confined to what's authorized in the
 
05:33:17.788 --> 05:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
compact legislation so uh that includes
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
things such as um you know if there is a
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
you know uh data set requirements to
 
05:33:24.510 --> 05:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
further refine that what's based in the
 
05:33:26.430 --> 05:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
compact uh but they can't unilaterally
 
05:33:28.150 --> 05:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
change those conditions that are already
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
represented in the legislation um and
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
also just wanted to to note one other
 
05:33:34.190 --> 05:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
thing that actually we're currently at
 
05:33:36.270 --> 05:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
six compact member states um so one
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
closer uh Nebraska uh um joined it
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday so just wanted to share that
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
news yes we have a report from our
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
researcher but it was from Monday
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
chair when we talk about these compacts
 
05:33:56.190 --> 05:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
compacts I look at specifically when I
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
look at these compacts is the nursing
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
Compact and I see it as it has been
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
nothing but a driver of increased health
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
care costs due to the fact
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
that once this was passed we have these
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
outside organizations
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
that hire travel nurses and just send
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
them around the state for the top dollar
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
that they can get filling in positions
 
05:34:31.590 --> 05:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
that cannot be filled and I don't
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
see any state out there with a surplus
 
05:34:37.190 --> 05:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
of nurses it's just the reallocation of
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
services is as to who can go where to
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
get more
 
05:34:40.200 --> 05:34:42.868 align:start position:0%
get more
money

05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:34:47.310 --> 05:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
and when I see that it's it just bothers
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
me we see it in our County nursing homes
 
05:34:50.350 --> 05:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
all the time when we can't fill
 
05:34:52.150 --> 05:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
positions and the costs going up with
 
05:34:56.110 --> 05:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
travel nursing can you how can you show
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
me that this same scenario won't happen
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
compact so I can say a few things to
 
05:35:05.230 --> 05:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
that that question and appreciate the
 
05:35:09.150 --> 05:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
concern uh one is that this compact is
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
different in for and function to the
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
nurse lure compact which essentially
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
employs a driver's license model so you
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
have a multi-state license you can apply
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
for through the compact that lies in
 
05:35:20.350 --> 05:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
each compact member State uh there is a
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism through this compact where a
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
PA who qualifies can purchase a
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice that authorization
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
practice in other compact member states
 
05:35:30.030 --> 05:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
for each state they want to practice in
 
05:35:32.430 --> 05:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
so uh there isn't that kind of uni
 
05:35:35.590 --> 05:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
access to um other compact member states
 
05:35:37.590 --> 05:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
um also just say from experience um with
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
with other compacts um we haven't yet
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
seen anything with that you know that
 
05:35:43.708 --> 05:35:43.718 align:start position:0%
direct um you know correlation or data
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
showing that increased in in kind of
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
health care costs um the the one data
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
point that we can um point to and these
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
compacts are still fairly inexistent so
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's studies being done is for the
 
05:35:57.190 --> 05:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
interstate medical lecture compact which
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
did show an increase in providers for
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
compact member
 
05:36:01.718 --> 05:36:04.190 align:start position:0%
compact member
states

05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
follow just I I need to make a statement
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
that I think all of here that have
 
05:36:10.350 --> 05:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes can say that it
 
05:36:14.470 --> 05:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:14.480 --> 05:36:16.430 align:start position:0%
 
costs

05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:36:16.440 --> 05:36:18.070 align:start position:0%
costs
okay

05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
repres when you say that this bill this
 
05:36:23.230 --> 05:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
compact is different I thought all
 
05:36:26.110 --> 05:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
compacts use the same boiler
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
plate so there are some differences
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
between compacts that need to be
 
05:36:31.548 --> 05:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
responsive to the needs of the
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
profession how States currently regulate
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
them so while there is some shared uh
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language that might exist in
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
the compact U particularly in the latter
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
section of the compact um there are
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
differences in how a compact um operates
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
um with you know again some similarities
 
05:36:49.910 --> 05:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
but uh for example in that the way that
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
someone would be able to access the
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
compact for the PA is different than it
 
05:36:54.670 --> 05:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
would be for Physicians and
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
nurses so I I be happy to explain any of
 
05:36:59.788 --> 05:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
the uh the more details in those
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:08.430 --> 05:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
needed not seeing uh
 
05:37:10.590 --> 05:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of demand for that so thank you
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney afternoon Lindsay Courtney
 
05:37:30.390 --> 05:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc um I will try to
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
keep this brief um you probably know
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to say anyways um and I
 
05:37:38.948 --> 05:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
think I can Echo uh the reason s why you
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
hire should adopt the physician
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
assistant lure compact um as the same
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
reasons that are previous speakers have
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
said but I would like to respond to a
 
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions um that have
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
come up from the committee um the first
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
being that um I think there was a
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
question representative Simon about um
 
05:38:01.868 --> 05:38:01.878 align:start position:0%
you know essentially why why would
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
military service members or their
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
spouses need this and I think that um
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's always need for portability
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
particularly in the healthcare sector
 
05:38:14.070 --> 05:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
given the changes in the delivery um so
 
05:38:17.708 --> 05:38:17.718 align:start position:0%
we no longer see the model consistently
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
where patients go physically go to their
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
their provider and they have an
 
05:38:24.190 --> 05:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
appointment and then they go home and
 
05:38:25.708 --> 05:38:25.718 align:start position:0%
that provider is located in New
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um often times we see
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
providers engaging in teleah health
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
practice crossb practice and so if you
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
have a a person who's you know typically
 
05:38:37.868 --> 05:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
residing in New Hampshire um um
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
traveling down to for example Boston to
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
see their uh provider but then decides
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a tele Health visit
 
05:38:47.110 --> 05:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
maybe their imuno compromise whatever
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the need is they need a New Hampshire
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
license in order to have that tele
 
05:38:54.350 --> 05:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
Health visit um the uh physician
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
Practice Act exempts um certain
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios from needing a license the PA
 
05:39:02.190 --> 05:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
Practice Act does not and I'm not aware
 
05:39:04.788 --> 05:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
of any other exemptions for that sort of
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
uh scenario so there is a need for
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
portability particularly given the
 
05:39:12.390 --> 05:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
change in delivery models another
 
05:39:15.270 --> 05:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
example would be in the mental health
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
world we see that with people who
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
specialize in psychiatric care you know
 
05:39:21.310 --> 05:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody's on vacation or traveling
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
college students we saw that during the
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a need for people to
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
get licensed quickly in order to
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
maintain continuity of care so I think I
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
would view it um less about having
 
05:39:36.190 --> 05:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
multiple different jobs uh across state
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
lines but more about
 
05:39:40.270 --> 05:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
um being able to continue to treat
 
05:39:43.468 --> 05:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
existing patients uh wherever they may
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
be um is a reason why we need
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
portability and compacts provide um one
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism for portability there was a
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
question about the CH the difference
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
between this Compact and the nurse lure
 
05:39:59.310 --> 05:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
compact what I would say is there are
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
generally two compact models one is the
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
driver's license model that we see with
 
05:40:07.468 --> 05:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
nurses provides greater flexibility less
 
05:40:09.070 --> 05:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
administrative burden but there's less
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
oversight by the state because you don't
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
know who's practicing in your state the
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
majority of compacts are modeled after
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
what we see in physical therapy that
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
require comp compact privilege you know
 
05:40:19.868 --> 05:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
who's practicing in your state and
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's this model the substance is
 
05:40:23.468 --> 05:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
essentially the same in terms of
 
05:40:25.150 --> 05:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language and I know we've
 
05:40:27.070 --> 05:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
talked about it in the past with social
 
05:40:30.030 --> 05:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
work um and other compact bills um but
 
05:40:31.830 --> 05:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
the model is different in the sense that
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
you have to get permission or
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
authorization that privilege to practice
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
there was um I think a question did you
 
05:40:45.910 --> 05:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
say that someone who is licens under the
 
05:40:48.110 --> 05:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
compact needs the permission of each
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
state to practice in that state yeah so
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
essentially they go through the um and
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
the permission has to be given right but
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
they go they typically go through
 
05:40:59.990 --> 05:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the body is the commission is
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
for for physical therapy as fsbt they
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the person has a streamlined application
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
they apply through the fsbt and the
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
compact privilege is issued but it's
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
issued specific to each state in which
 
05:41:16.270 --> 05:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to practice um that's not
 
05:41:18.430 --> 05:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
my personal favorite in terms of a model
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
but it does provide a little bit more
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
oversight by the state because they can
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
then tack on additional requirements
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
Juris prent of contain education um
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
there's also a revenue Source associated
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
with that um there was a question about
 
05:41:33.548 --> 05:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreements and
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
the way I would look at lenser
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
requirements versus collaborative
 
05:41:39.468 --> 05:41:39.478 align:start position:0%
practice as as the compact sets forth
 
05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
the lure requirements but it's not going
 
05:41:44.590 --> 05:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
to change the scope of practice and
 
05:41:47.390 --> 05:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
whether whether a physician assistant is
 
05:41:49.468 --> 05:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
required to have a collaborative
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
practice agreement is required to be
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
supervised or can independently practice
 
05:41:56.030 --> 05:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
is a scope of is really a scope of
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
practice question we see that with aprns
 
05:42:00.868 --> 05:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is fairly unique and that
 
05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
we allow for independent provider status
 
05:42:04.510 --> 05:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
if they go to New Hampshire they don't
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
have that same Stat or Massachusetts
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have that same status it
 
05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they don't they can't
 
05:42:12.190 --> 05:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
get licensed or that the requirements
 
05:42:13.708 --> 05:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
aren't the same because they're likely
 
05:42:16.270 --> 05:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
identical it's a scope of practice issue
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
so the compact's not going to dictate
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
the collaborative practice question um
 
05:42:22.670 --> 05:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
or answer to that question because
 
05:42:25.430 --> 05:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's very comparable to the scope of
 
05:42:27.390 --> 05:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
practice I think those are the things
 
05:42:30.430 --> 05:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
that I I wanted to address um I guess
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
lastly I would say that the goal of or
 
05:42:36.750 --> 05:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
the objective of the licensing boards is
 
05:42:39.868 --> 05:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
to protect the public um and I would say
 
05:42:42.070 --> 05:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
that of the different models for
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
portability and we've seen several in
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
this state compacts provide greater
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
public protection because of the
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
requirement to exchange information with
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
other states so if somebody's coming in
 
05:42:55.840 --> 05:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
other states so if somebody's coming in
from

05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
California um and they're requesting a
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
single state license for you know via
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
the pathway um this committee um past
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
last session HB 594 we're going to
 
05:43:13.548 --> 05:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
verify that license but we are really
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
relying on their attestations that they
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
don't have anything pending and they
 
05:43:19.708 --> 05:43:19.718 align:start position:0%
don't have any other licenses in another
 
05:43:21.788 --> 05:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
state we're in the dark there's no
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's no system um when you're part of
 
05:43:26.830 --> 05:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
a compact you're required if you know
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
there's a significant investigative
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
information you're required to
 
05:43:32.670 --> 05:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
essentially make that available subject
 
05:43:37.270 --> 05:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
to state law um under uh for your for
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
compact uh participants uh for your
 
05:43:42.270 --> 05:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
States so it's more protective of the
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
public because you get a a fuller
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
picture of what's happened with that
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
particular licy to see whether they're
 
05:43:49.868 --> 05:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
form shopping if they're just going from
 
05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
state to state to state before they can
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
be disciplined and I think in that sense
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's more protective of the public and
 
05:43:58.310 --> 05:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
why we as administrators really like
 
05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
compacts versus other mechanisms for
 
05:44:03.548 --> 05:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
portability happy to answer any other
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you are
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
there questions represent br
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
compacts provide more safety than than
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
what than other mechanisms for
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
portability okay but that doesn't mean
 
05:44:23.468 --> 05:44:23.478 align:start position:0%
it provides more safety to the public
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
than what we have now in the state like
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:44:33.390 --> 05:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
oplc what I'm saying is we believe that
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
being part I believe that being part of
 
05:44:37.830 --> 05:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
the compact provides the office with
 
05:44:40.510 --> 05:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
more information necessary to be able to
 
05:44:43.310 --> 05:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
make the decisions um as to whether or
 
05:44:44.788 --> 05:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
not you know somebody should be licensed
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
or we need to proceed down a
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
disciplinary route um than we currently
 
05:44:51.628 --> 05:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
have under our existing statutory
 
05:44:51.638 --> 05:44:53.230 align:start position:0%
have under our existing statutory
structure

05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
structure
 
05:44:55.548 --> 05:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair I I probably
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
have more questions than the director
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
would care to answer at this particular
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
point in time um but um and having made
 
05:45:05.910 --> 05:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
that joke I forgot all of my questions
 
05:45:05.920 --> 05:45:08.628 align:start position:0%
that joke I forgot all of my questions
um

05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
going back to my initial question start
 
05:45:14.190 --> 05:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
with that what need would there be for a
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
physician's assistant outside of
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
potentially um telea medicine to
 
05:45:20.948 --> 05:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
practice in multiple States at the same
 
05:45:22.510 --> 05:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
time where this would be helpful to them
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
like how are they practicing in Nebraska
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire at the same time um
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would be my first question and just
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
quickly with a followup on that um how
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
long does it take to get a license in
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire right now and
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
what's it costing a PA to get that
 
05:45:38.190 --> 05:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
license so the cost
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
$175 um if they submit a complete
 
05:45:44.190 --> 05:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
application um we can turn that around
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
in a business day the the longest
 
05:45:49.708 --> 05:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
processing time is due to receiving an
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
incomplete licensing application and the
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
FBI criminal history check that's
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
required that's still taking about two
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
weeks so once we get that we can process
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
it very quickly um the first part of
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
okay the scenarios in which I mean so
 
05:46:07.030 --> 05:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is very unlike nurses we don't see
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
see we don't see the same level um of
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
travel assignments with Pro with
 
05:46:18.070 --> 05:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
providers than we do with nurses um so
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
there so what we see the why we see the
 
05:46:24.510 --> 05:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
need for multiple licenses is truly the
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
the delivery uh model and the changes in
 
05:46:30.510 --> 05:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
the delivery models um for military
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
families though and this is why the
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense has really funded
 
05:46:36.910 --> 05:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
these initiatives is that often times
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know we see the spouses are licensed
 
05:46:41.910 --> 05:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
as a physician assistant and they get
 
05:46:44.708 --> 05:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
orders and they have to move quickly and
 
05:46:46.510 --> 05:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
they'd like to be able to find a job and
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
often in healthcare you can't even um
 
05:46:51.468 --> 05:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
you know you can't finalize a job offer
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
until you can demonstrate that you're
 
05:46:56.670 --> 05:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
were licensed um so that's a challenge
 
05:46:58.910 --> 05:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
as well with a compact they could they
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
would know for certain that they they
 
05:47:02.468 --> 05:47:02.478 align:start position:0%
have a job opportunity because they're
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
able to get licensed through um through
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
the compact quickly
 
05:47:10.030 --> 05:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
follow up and then we'll see anybody
 
05:47:13.628 --> 05:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
else has sounds good um I'll I'll forgo
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
my first followup then I go to my second
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
one um is
 
05:47:21.230 --> 05:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
there we've we've started to approve
 
05:47:24.990 --> 05:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
these compacts and now everybody wants a
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
compact I mean we're getting a compact
 
05:47:29.708 --> 05:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
from everybody is there evidence that
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the compacts that we've put in place
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
already are delivering the results that
 
05:47:36.628 --> 05:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for and I just I I guess I
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
would refer back to the um social worker
 
05:47:42.030 --> 05:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
compact that we just discussed and and I
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
wish I had thought to ask the question
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
at the time but people were talking
 
05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
about how they were not allowed to give
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
continuance of care but the but all of
 
05:47:51.750 --> 05:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
the examples that they were giving were
 
05:47:53.230 --> 05:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
examples in which it seemed like the
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
person that they were
 
05:47:57.670 --> 05:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
servicing ended up without a significant
 
05:47:59.788 --> 05:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
negative impact for their inability to
 
05:48:01.948 --> 05:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
have the continuance of care we didn't
 
05:48:04.590 --> 05:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
have any testimony of self harm or
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
suicide or anything like they didn't
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
come forward with that kind of
 
05:48:09.230 --> 05:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
information and when I asked I did ask
 
05:48:10.990 --> 05:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
for whether or not there was evidence
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the psychology compact was meeting
 
05:48:15.430 --> 05:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
its stated goals whether it was
 
05:48:17.350 --> 05:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
producing those good outcomes I didn't
 
05:48:19.230 --> 05:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
receive any of that information and now
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
I've got a physician's assistance
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
contact and and I feel like we're just
 
05:48:24.468 --> 05:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
continuing to push these things through
 
05:48:26.830 --> 05:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
because they maybe sound good or because
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's some level of portability to
 
05:48:31.948 --> 05:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
them but without receiving I'm never
 
05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
receiving any evidence that they're
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually accomplishing what they're set
 
05:48:37.230 --> 05:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
out to accomplish we've already pulled
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
out of one of them so can you put my
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
mind at isas a little bit on that yeah
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I would I know um Mr Sims from um CSG
 
05:48:48.590 --> 05:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
referenced uh some studies there's
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
limited studies um and I don't think
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
cypa is the best example because I I I
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
of all the compacts that's the one I I I
 
05:49:01.230 --> 05:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not a fan of um mainly because it's
 
05:49:03.270 --> 05:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
a limited in scope it only applies to
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
Tele health so I don't know why you
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
would structure it that way but the
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
reason why we're seeing an increase in
 
05:49:11.948 --> 05:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
the number of compacts is because the
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense has put some funds
 
05:49:15.910 --> 05:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
behind it because they recognize that it
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
it benefits military families and
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
particularly spouses so that's why we're
 
05:49:22.030 --> 05:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
seeing the development and I would say
 
05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
that it takes a couple of years to get a
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
compact up and running so counseling we
 
05:49:28.350 --> 05:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
joined I think two years ago we're not
 
05:49:30.390 --> 05:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
even issuing privileges yet so it's
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
really still premature I think to be
 
05:49:35.708 --> 05:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
able to have data anecdotally I will say
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
though um I mean my experience managing
 
05:49:41.510 --> 05:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
oplc throughout the pandemic um without
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
the nursing compact I there's no this
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
state uh would have been in much worse
 
05:49:49.788 --> 05:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
shape and I know that we're not in great
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
shape right now um you know
 
05:49:53.548 --> 05:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
representative go brought up the nursing
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
home shortage and certainly there isn't
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
a massive surplus of nurses anywhere but
 
05:50:03.390 --> 05:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
um but I think the but I I continue to
 
05:50:06.990 --> 05:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
receive but less frequently so but
 
05:50:08.910 --> 05:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
particularly during Co and
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
thereafter would receive calls weekends
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
nights midnights we have we have no
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
staff we're going to have to shut down
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
what do we do with our patients I need
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
to bring in this person um from
 
05:50:22.468 --> 05:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
professions that weren't nursing and the
 
05:50:24.590 --> 05:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
fact that nursing people who are part of
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the compact could just come into the
 
05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
state and accept a travel assignment for
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
20 days uh to meet an urgent short-term
 
05:50:34.390 --> 05:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
need really really anecdotally helped
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um that's just my personal
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
opinion based on what we were seeing
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic what we saw with
 
05:50:43.708 --> 05:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Professions for example I
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
mean we um I mean I think we increased
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
the number of psychologists overnight
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
under an emergency license by
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
65% um which is insane which
 
05:50:56.990 --> 05:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the crossb practice that
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
was happening and while we we may not
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
seem harm from continuity of care it's
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
actually an ethical violation for
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
somebody to abandon their client and so
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
what they're faced with is a question of
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
do I discontinu care so as to comply
 
05:51:14.670 --> 05:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
with the law and not provide unlicensed
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
practice which technically is a crime
 
05:51:18.510 --> 05:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
whether it should be you know is a
 
05:51:20.750 --> 05:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
question maybe you should consider but
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but or or um do I abandon my client
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
and um commit an ethical violation which
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
could subject me to uh charges of
 
05:51:30.840 --> 05:51:33.628 align:start position:0%
could subject me to uh charges of
professional

05:51:33.628 --> 05:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct sorry okay representative
 
05:51:40.030 --> 05:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
goalie and then gr thank you madam chair
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
and just I need to go back to the
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
reference of during covid and being able
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
to get those nurses up here in New
 
05:51:49.390 --> 05:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire travel nurses that we
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
needed could you tell me what state out
 
05:51:54.830 --> 05:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
there had a surplus to give out I mean
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
because every nurse we took in was
 
05:51:58.590 --> 05:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
leaving a hole somewhere else and that's
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
the issue I have with these
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
compacts I guess what I would say is uh
 
05:52:07.310 --> 05:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have the same ratio nurse to
 
05:52:10.468 --> 05:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
population that throughout the state we
 
05:52:13.310 --> 05:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
also have an aging population um more so
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
than other states so it's possible that
 
05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
our need might be greater given uh our
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
aging population so I don't
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
think we don't again we don't have the
 
05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
same ratio of nurses to to um the
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
general population throughout the
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
country so we clearly were drawing
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
people in um for short term assignments
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
now of course the the model is not great
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
because you're paying a lot of money um
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
and people can't can't keep up and that
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
of course is a challenge that this
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature has um tried to solve
 
05:52:53.310 --> 05:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
particularly with the nurse registry uh
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
the nursing agency registry that you
 
05:52:57.230 --> 05:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
passed last year I don't know what the
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
long-term solution is other than to
 
05:53:01.270 --> 05:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
focus on Pipeline which is something
 
05:53:03.510 --> 05:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
that you know our agency along with
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
other agencies and stakeholders are
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
working on but what is clear is that we
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
brought people in we may have been
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
paying them but the alternative was what
 
05:53:13.868 --> 05:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
to not bring them in and then we
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:23.948 --> 05:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
all I
 
05:53:26.390 --> 05:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
guess one of the answers
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
is the problem to solve is how do we get
 
05:53:32.110 --> 05:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
more healthcare workers instead of
 
05:53:34.750 --> 05:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
compacts where states
 
05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
are divided about
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves on whoever is going
 
05:53:43.150 --> 05:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
to pay the top dollar to bring in the
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
individuals and that's where I guess
 
05:53:48.468 --> 05:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
philosophically we differ in these
 
05:53:51.510 --> 05:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
compacts I think we need to step back
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
look at the long-term effects of the
 
05:53:56.590 --> 05:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
compacts that are out there now carry
 
05:53:58.468 --> 05:53:58.478 align:start position:0%
before we continue to keep going into
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
more and more compacts not knowing what
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
the real ramifications are I don't think
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
we disagree on the philosophy I think I
 
05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it can be either or though
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
approach I guess that's my my opinion I
 
05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
think we can do both at the same time
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we should do both at the same time
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
but for example you know Medical Imaging
 
05:54:18.070 --> 05:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's a license type that we have in
 
05:54:20.350 --> 05:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't it's not other
 
05:54:21.830 --> 05:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
states don't have that license type but
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have it here um and because of the
 
05:54:25.510 --> 05:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
criminal history record check
 
05:54:27.990 --> 05:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
requirement we can't we've we've changed
 
05:54:29.548 --> 05:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
that subsequently with a temporary
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
license but at the time we couldn't
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
issue a license we'd wait the two weeks
 
05:54:35.708 --> 05:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
we had entire emergency department
 
05:54:37.708 --> 05:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
shutting down not being able to doing
 
05:54:40.110 --> 05:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
Imaging for patients even though they
 
05:54:42.190 --> 05:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
had a traveler who was willing to accept
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
an assignment so what a compact does is
 
05:54:48.948 --> 05:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
that it gets rid of that twoe window so
 
05:54:51.990 --> 05:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
when we're in this crisis situation we
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
can actually put somebody in there to
 
05:54:55.990 --> 05:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
work to continue to provide care while
 
05:54:57.948 --> 05:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
we work on the long-term solution which
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
I agree with you there has to be a
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
solution which is you know pipeline
 
05:55:03.548 --> 05:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
getting more people involved but I don't
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
think it's an either
 
05:55:05.320 --> 05:55:11.310 align:start position:0%
think it's an either
or

05:55:11.310 --> 05:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I've been under the impression
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
that the compact is a boilerplate
 
05:55:19.708 --> 05:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
document and can't be amended but this
 
05:55:22.270 --> 05:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
is not the case is that because I was
 
05:55:24.430 --> 05:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
just told that this compact is different
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
from other compacts I think there are
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
two different things you can't amend
 
05:55:30.990 --> 05:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
this language because every state you
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
can or can cannot cannot because every
 
05:55:35.230 --> 05:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
state has to adopt the same language
 
05:55:36.948 --> 05:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
because it's both a cont ract and a
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and if you don't
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
adopt the same language you're not
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
there's no meaning of the minds
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
essentially um this compact I think what
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
U Mr Sims was saying was we were talking
 
05:55:51.030 --> 05:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
about nursing which has a different
 
05:55:53.468 --> 05:55:53.478 align:start position:0%
model in terms of the driver's license
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
model you get one license and uh you can
 
05:55:58.628 --> 05:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
go anywhere and you don't even have to
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
notify the state that you're there
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
that's one model the other model is the
 
05:56:04.990 --> 05:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
majority of other licens or compacts
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
like physical therapy speech uh I think
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
psychology as well where you have to you
 
05:56:12.350 --> 05:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
have to let the state know you're there
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the privilege model but under
 
05:56:16.990 --> 05:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
either scenario which this is the
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
privilege model you can't change the
 
05:56:20.000 --> 05:56:21.910 align:start position:0%
privilege model you can't change the
document

05:56:21.910 --> 05:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right other questions represent
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam Char I just
 
05:56:27.948 --> 05:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
realized my mic's been on this whole
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
time um so when we're when we're looking
 
05:56:33.070 --> 05:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
at Co in particular because obviously
 
05:56:34.590 --> 05:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
was a different set of circumstances
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
than in general um would emergency
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
orders from the governor have allowed
 
05:56:41.190 --> 05:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
for lure to be given in emergency
 
05:56:42.830 --> 05:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
situations even though it didn't comply
 
05:56:46.270 --> 05:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.990 --> 05:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
licensure yeah so we did do that and
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
we the executive branch took the
 
05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
position that executive orders pursu to
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency could override
 
05:56:56.638 --> 05:56:57.868 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency could override
legislative

05:56:57.868 --> 05:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:57:00.590 --> 05:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
requirements um and so we did do that
 
05:57:05.070 --> 05:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
and originally um I think early on um
 
05:57:07.270 --> 05:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
the state had considered just allowing
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
people who are licensed elsewhere to
 
05:57:10.948 --> 05:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
practice here but then you get into the
 
05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement issue and so we had to
 
05:57:13.280 --> 05:57:14.190 align:start position:0%
reimbursement issue and so we had to
issue

05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:57:17.788 --> 05:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
licenses um and we were able to turn it
 
05:57:21.788 --> 05:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
around fairly quickly um but of course
 
05:57:24.990 --> 05:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know even today we still have issues
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
um with certain professions with just
 
05:57:31.628 --> 05:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
having an urgent need particularly for
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
Imaging um and there is no state of
 
05:57:35.708 --> 05:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
emergency and there's no ability to wave
 
05:57:39.270 --> 05:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
those wave those requirements so um but
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
yes we did do that we issued over 22,000
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
licenses under the state of
 
05:57:45.628 --> 05:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
emergency thank
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
you g Harden then
 
05:57:51.390 --> 05:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair from what
 
05:57:53.070 --> 05:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding the real issue is the
 
05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
federal government is taking too long to
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
get these background checks done two
 
05:57:58.030 --> 05:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
weeks you say whereas your department
 
05:58:01.628 --> 05:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
can turn around one
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
day so if we could have background
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
checks done quickly there would be no
 
05:58:09.310 --> 05:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
need for these which I consider kind of
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
an roundabout attempt for a national ID
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like but what anyway is that
 
05:58:16.750 --> 05:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
basically what you're saying
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
though I think that compacts do provide
 
05:58:23.468 --> 05:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
a a faster way to getting a license
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
through a privilege um and rather than
 
05:58:29.868 --> 05:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
having to do you know criminal history
 
05:58:32.190 --> 05:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
record check everywhere depending on the
 
05:58:34.190 --> 05:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
model you you know you can just do it
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
once um
 
05:58:39.830 --> 05:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the feds yeah I mean so there's a
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
multip step process here right it and
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
and part of the issue with criminal
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
history record checks and there's some
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
national legislation that's been filed
 
05:58:50.190 --> 05:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
to try to resolve this it's probably not
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to go anywhere um but it the way
 
05:58:54.750 --> 05:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
it works is the person has to get
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted and then the safety has
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
staff members and they have to be have
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
very specific training and they have to
 
05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
essentially approve of the fingerprint
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then it goes off to the f bi and
 
05:59:09.628 --> 05:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
then it comes over and we and we get a
 
05:59:11.110 --> 05:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
print out certainly if they could do
 
05:59:14.510 --> 05:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
that faster that would be nice um there
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
is a uh a wraback program available to
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies but the pro the
 
05:59:21.708 --> 05:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
challenge is we are not a law
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency I wouldn't I wouldn't
 
05:59:26.510 --> 05:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
suggest we should be one um so there are
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities available to
 
05:59:29.468 --> 05:59:29.478 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies to get that
 
05:59:34.150 --> 05:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
information back um but we are presently
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see any movement there current
 
05:59:39.510 --> 05:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
ly representative
 
05:59:44.468 --> 05:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
Brown thank thank you madam chair So
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
currently in 31016 where military
 
05:59:48.990 --> 05:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
service members and their spouses and
 
05:59:50.110 --> 05:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
this is really important kind of to
 
05:59:51.788 --> 05:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative goalie and
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
with the deputy agitant
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
General this compact would make that
 
06:00:00.868 --> 06:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
process for those coming here even
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
possibly more efficient than what's
 
06:00:03.600 --> 06:00:04.948 align:start position:0%
possibly more efficient than what's
under

06:00:04.948 --> 06:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:00:04.958 --> 06:00:06.548 align:start position:0%
under
31016

06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
31016
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
so what yes correct yep absolutely okay
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
and follow up to that follow that would
 
06:00:15.548 --> 06:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
ALS the compact would also make it then
 
06:00:18.628 --> 06:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
easier for a a spouse or a military
 
06:00:21.310 --> 06:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
person to go to another state that is
 
06:00:24.270 --> 06:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
within the compact working more quickly
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and more easily that's the point some of
 
06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
part of the point right right and and
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow up again for military service
 
06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
members to possi carry their provider
 
06:00:39.230 --> 06:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
with them for an amount of time at least
 
06:00:40.750 --> 06:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
till they find another provider in
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
another state correct if it's even if
 
06:00:48.990 --> 06:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair provided that
 
06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
the state that they came from or are
 
06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
going to is a member of the compact
 
06:01:01.190 --> 06:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
correct I mean the compacts are drafted
 
06:01:03.910 --> 06:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the intent that all states are
 
06:01:06.350 --> 06:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to adopt obviously that's not the
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
case but I do think counseling is
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
upwards of 40 and I think nursing is as
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
well um so there is an appetite uh for
 
06:01:14.760 --> 06:01:16.468 align:start position:0%
well um so there is an appetite uh for
for

06:01:16.468 --> 06:01:16.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
compacts okay other
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
06:01:25.788 --> 06:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
Testimony appreciate it all
 
06:01:28.868 --> 06:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
right does anyone else wish to testify
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.840 --> 06:01:38.788 align:start position:0%
 
cousing

06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:40.830 --> 06:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for the record
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
Dave Cousy with Prospect Hill strategies
 
06:01:45.390 --> 06:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh here on behalf of the society
 
06:01:48.030 --> 06:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
physician assistants I just wanted to
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
clarify one uh or two points uh
 
06:01:54.390 --> 06:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
questions from representative Simon uh
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
one from representative Simon and one
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
that was really uh the same from
 
06:01:58.830 --> 06:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gro and representative
 
06:02:01.548 --> 06:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
Simon first uh representative Simon I
 
06:02:03.548 --> 06:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
think you asked a question regarding you
 
06:02:05.868 --> 06:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
know why would you why does a PA in New
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a PA Nebraska what's the
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
what's the rub I think the other thing
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind is the the regional
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
health systems especially in the small
 
06:02:16.868 --> 06:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
states that we're in here so um you know
 
06:02:18.510 --> 06:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
if you work for Dartmouth Hitchcock for
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
example um I I don't know this to be
 
06:02:24.110 --> 06:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
100% fact but if they have operation if
 
06:02:26.110 --> 06:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
they have an office in Vermont that you
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
may be employed and if it's you know
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
primary care or whatnot you're going to
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
be going back and forth but that re
 
06:02:34.390 --> 06:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
regionalization of healthcare I think is
 
06:02:35.948 --> 06:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
something we need to keep in mind so so
 
06:02:38.910 --> 06:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
that uh these Healthcare employers can
 
06:02:41.910 --> 06:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility for their um for
 
06:02:43.948 --> 06:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
their employees if they need to have be
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
working in different states so that was
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
to that I think the most important thing
 
06:02:49.468 --> 06:02:49.478 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I wanted to get
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
between the committee and going home was
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
just to give a very clear answer to the
 
06:02:55.590 --> 06:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
question that you representative Simon
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
then representative Gro you followed up
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
on regarding the kind of the Nuance of
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
this Compact and how it pertains to
 
06:03:04.990 --> 06:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreements so very clearly
 
06:03:08.708 --> 06:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
anyone who's in this compact or any any
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
physician assistant but if in the
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
scenario where there's a compact a PA
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
licensed in the compact they want to
 
06:03:17.548 --> 06:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire they need under
 
06:03:19.750 --> 06:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
current law a collaboration agreement
 
06:03:22.670 --> 06:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
signed with a New Hampshire licensed
 
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
physician period if they're coming from
 
06:03:29.468 --> 06:03:29.478 align:start position:0%
a state uh for example Maine where there
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
is relaxed collaboration agreement rules
 
06:03:33.750 --> 06:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh those employed in a healthcare
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
setting in Maine after 4,000 hours do
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
not need a collaboration agreement if
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
they were coming here under the compact
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
they would still need and they had
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
10,000 clinical hours of practice so
 
06:03:45.868 --> 06:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
they didn't need one in Maine in their
 
06:03:47.628 --> 06:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
employed setting they would need one
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
here under current law period um now the
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
the flip side which I think
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative groda may have been
 
06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
asking about is what if a New Hampshire
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
PA that's under a collaboration
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreement of course under current law if
 
06:04:02.750 --> 06:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
they went
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
to um Utah which I believe as a state
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that after 10,000 hours you don't need a
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement and they've been
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
practicing for 20 years then in Utah
 
06:04:15.390 --> 06:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire PA would not need a
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement to practice
 
06:04:19.990 --> 06:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
medicine in Utah but as soon as they're
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
back here they they can't practice
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
without that collaboration agreement
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
more important should uh HB 1222 become
 
06:04:32.070 --> 06:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
law the requirement uh as the bill
 
06:04:34.990 --> 06:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
passed the house that uh anyone uh
 
06:04:37.990 --> 06:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
working either by themselves or in some
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
employment setting without a physician
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
with less than 8,000 hours of practice
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
time they need a collab they would need
 
06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
a collaboration agreement in New
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under law there would be no
 
06:04:50.948 --> 06:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
backdoor way for someone to come into
 
06:04:54.190 --> 06:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and circumvent any
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement laws either
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
current law or you know as proposed by
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
1222 so I wanted to make that make that
 
06:05:01.920 --> 06:05:03.230 align:start position:0%
1222 so I wanted to make that make that
abundantly

06:05:03.230 --> 06:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
abundantly
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
clear okay when in Rome I guess is how
 
06:05:09.150 --> 06:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
the how this would work for Pas okay
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
representative Simon and then
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
goalie sorry representative goalie um so
 
06:05:16.030 --> 06:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
following they were answers to my
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions and I appreciate that follow
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
up on those though um so when it comes
 
06:05:21.910 --> 06:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
to my question about whether or not it
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
would make it more difficult to get a
 
06:05:25.510 --> 06:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement in this model if
 
06:05:26.868 --> 06:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
I'm reading you correctly you're saying
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be more difficult but it
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
might be a whole lot more expensive
 
06:05:32.110 --> 06:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
because a person when they're practicing
 
06:05:32.990 --> 06:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would need a
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration in New Hampshire if they
 
06:05:36.430 --> 06:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to also to practice in Maine they
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
need a separate collaboration agreement
 
06:05:40.030 --> 06:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
in Maine they went to another state they
 
06:05:41.310 --> 06:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
required a collaboration agreement they
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
would need a separate collaboration
 
06:05:45.310 --> 06:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
agreement in that state is that correct
 
06:05:47.788 --> 06:05:47.798 align:start position:0%
if those States required collaboration
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
agreements for that physician assistant
 
06:05:54.190 --> 06:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
based on their laws and regulations if
 
06:05:56.430 --> 06:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's clinical practice hours for
 
06:05:59.070 --> 06:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
example in that scenario just speaking
 
06:06:01.350 --> 06:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
in general the answer is yes they would
 
06:06:02.788 --> 06:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
need three separate collaboration
 
06:06:05.948 --> 06:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
agreements okay follow up super follow
 
06:06:10.350 --> 06:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
up one yeah just one um so when we're
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these kinds of
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
things you know we're obviously talking
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
a compact that would affect many states
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
but our our job here is just to focus on
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and and what
 
06:06:22.030 --> 06:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
happens here um so my question on the
 
06:06:23.310 --> 06:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
first part that you answered where
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's collaboration between states or
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're on a border you know Town whatever
 
06:06:28.510 --> 06:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at what we're providing
 
06:06:29.910 --> 06:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
for the State of New
 
06:06:32.070 --> 06:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's
 
06:06:35.070 --> 06:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
$175 and potentially a day plus criminal
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
records check turnaround from you having
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
a a license in here what is the net
 
06:06:40.910 --> 06:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to the state of New Hampshire
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
from your perspective in that scenario
 
06:06:44.430 --> 06:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not Nebraska right I mean
 
06:06:46.830 --> 06:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking Vermont sure um what's the
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
net benefit to the state of New
 
06:06:49.628 --> 06:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to not have those people
 
06:06:52.430 --> 06:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
directly under licensure here as opposed
 
06:06:54.548 --> 06:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
to under some collaboration agreement
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
that really is centered somewhere we
 
06:06:58.830 --> 06:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't even know where at this particular
 
06:07:02.070 --> 06:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
point in time um could give me a good
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
little guidance on that so I'll I'll do
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
the best I can although that could be be
 
06:07:08.190 --> 06:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
better answered by Miss Leslie and Mr
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
Sims um I I as I understand it and I'm
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
just a lobbyist um but as I understand
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
it while notionally it can take a day or
 
06:07:18.590 --> 06:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
two to turn around a license application
 
06:07:22.590 --> 06:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
I I I believe that's not actually um in
 
06:07:26.310 --> 06:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
most cases it takes uh a week or two uh
 
06:07:29.310 --> 06:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
usually closer to two as I understand it
 
06:07:31.628 --> 06:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe direct criminal
 
06:07:33.868 --> 06:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
background checks uh well so the whole
 
06:07:36.670 --> 06:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
so the whole process so yes Theory all
 
06:07:38.468 --> 06:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
these things could you know the moon and
 
06:07:40.468 --> 06:07:40.478 align:start position:0%
the sun because we're talking about the
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
eclipse we could get one of those and
 
06:07:43.628 --> 06:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
it's could only be a day or two but we
 
06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
do know that it takes longer uh so that
 
06:07:48.910 --> 06:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
is a benefit
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is there um are there benefits you
 
06:07:56.548 --> 06:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
know to shaving that those two weeks off
 
06:07:59.070 --> 06:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm not I I I'm sure I could
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
come up on the Fly I wasn't prepared to
 
06:08:02.830 --> 06:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
answer the question with some scenarios
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
where you have folks who may be
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
relocating to the area things along
 
06:08:08.110 --> 06:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
those lines but we could get a a better
 
06:08:09.948 --> 06:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
answer for that for you if you think and
 
06:08:11.628 --> 06:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
we have some time I'm assuming so you
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
can get me some information happy thank
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question represent
 
06:08:19.150 --> 06:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
gy thank you madam chair thank you for
 
06:08:20.270 --> 06:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned earlier about
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
Regional areas like Dartmouth with
 
06:08:29.310 --> 06:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont or wherever they may be right in
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
the area is
 
06:08:31.680 --> 06:08:33.548 align:start position:0%
the area is
there

06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh reciprocity or States getting to
 
06:08:39.600 --> 06:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh reciprocity or States getting to
reciprocity

06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
06:08:45.468 --> 06:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
agreements so I know I believe it was HB
 
06:08:49.830 --> 06:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
540 P last year was the reciprocity law
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
um I believe the short answer is with
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
regard to PA licenses uh I'm not sure
 
06:08:58.788 --> 06:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
how that is how that applies because
 
06:09:01.708 --> 06:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
right now there is Board of Medicine uh
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
approval and things like that um maybe
 
06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
director Courtney uh or if they're I
 
06:09:08.590 --> 06:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if they've left they've left
 
06:09:11.350 --> 06:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
they yeah no that's good uh why not let
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist squirm right no uh so I I
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
believe there could be in some instances
 
06:09:17.788 --> 06:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that would specifically
 
06:09:21.390 --> 06:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
apply here um it does get into the uh
 
06:09:23.868 --> 06:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
the issue of similar similar
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and certifications and
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
whatnot which may be uh slightly
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
different when you're talking about uh
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers um you know
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
medical uh practitioners so I'll have to
 
06:09:37.110 --> 06:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that representative
 
06:09:38.350 --> 06:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the
 
06:09:41.390 --> 06:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
question followup comment I wish you
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
know more
 
06:09:44.430 --> 06:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
States while the
 
06:09:47.590 --> 06:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
compact seems okay I think a lot of the
 
06:09:49.310 --> 06:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
issues could be solved if we could get
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
back to these kind of agreements
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocities I think would help a lot
 
06:09:55.670 --> 06:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why we're not re moving
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
that way yes Pro probably because the
 
06:10:01.750 --> 06:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
other state has to be interested and
 
06:10:03.910 --> 06:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont might be interested in
 
06:10:05.590 --> 06:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
establishing reciprocity but
 
06:10:08.590 --> 06:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in general is not and
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more doctors and other
 
06:10:15.510 --> 06:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're not joining the
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
compacts either very
 
06:10:24.750 --> 06:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
much yes yes so that's uh one of the
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
factors is that we're a very small
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
fish all right any other questions
 
06:10:33.070 --> 06:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
represent Brown thank you madam
 
06:10:35.788 --> 06:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
chair this is a question question and a
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
comment I guess so this would from a
 
06:10:40.468 --> 06:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
tella Health perspective this would
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
apply to snowbirds that live in New
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seven months a year and maybe
 
06:10:47.030 --> 06:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere five months a year they could
 
06:10:50.468 --> 06:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
maintain that PA relationship while
 
06:10:52.030 --> 06:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
they're in that other state for five
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
months is that a scenario that would
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefit that is a scenario and that is
 
06:10:58.110 --> 06:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
something that we see now with
 
06:11:00.030 --> 06:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
Physicians and and nurses and therefore
 
06:11:02.350 --> 06:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners yes it seems obvious
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the rest of you probably but thank
 
06:11:06.510 --> 06:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much mam chair
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else wish to
 
06:11:16.468 --> 06:11:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
486 not seeing anybody I'm going to
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:26.350 --> 06:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
06:11:28.390 --> 06:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
this I don't know this I don't think
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
this needs a study committee we just
 
06:11:30.120 --> 06:11:34.230 align:start position:0%
this needs a study committee we just
need

06:11:34.230 --> 06:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:34.240 --> 06:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
to

06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:45.708 --> 06:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
well I don't think it needs
 
06:11:49.468 --> 06:11:49.478 align:start position:0%
a sure all right and that representative
 
06:11:51.990 --> 06:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
broa suggests we go into executive
 
06:11:54.670 --> 06:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
session and uh you would you like to
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion right I'd like to make a
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on this bill and I don't
 
06:12:06.310 --> 06:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh how Senate Bill 43 486 all right
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
06:12:11.910 --> 06:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
second well I'll second it
 
06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually do you wish to speak to your
 
06:12:14.080 --> 06:12:16.350 align:start position:0%
actually do you wish to speak to your
motion

06:12:16.350 --> 06:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
because we have we're in a state of flux
 
06:12:24.548 --> 06:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
ourselves with
 
06:12:28.670 --> 06:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pas and we have um legislation that's
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
pending I don't know and we have this
 
06:12:34.110 --> 06:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
other bill that we had earlier on the
 
06:12:37.390 --> 06:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
military I don't know how much more we
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
need and I think that for right now we
 
06:12:47.310 --> 06:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
can not pass this bill not have any
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
detriment effects to our state because
 
06:12:52.110 --> 06:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
we can still accept
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
military I'm sure that the the Senate
 
06:12:57.030 --> 06:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill that we had earlier Senate Bill 488
 
06:12:59.788 --> 06:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
will pass so I think that we can just
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
sit with what we've got right now and
 
06:13:06.110 --> 06:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
not go any further okay I'd like to add
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
that at the rate other states are
 
06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
joining this
 
06:13:13.110 --> 06:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
compact they'll be the commission will
 
06:13:15.788 --> 06:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
be formed and they'll start putting out
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
the rules and we will have a much better
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
idea of what we're signing up for in a
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
year or two once the commission has been
 
06:13:26.708 --> 06:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
formed and has a chance to work and I'm
 
06:13:28.548 --> 06:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
not convinced that being in the first
 
06:13:28.558 --> 06:13:29.628 align:start position:0%
not convinced that being in the first
few

06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
few
 
06:13:32.150 --> 06:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
States is enough to make up for the
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
detriment of signing up for things you
 
06:13:36.750 --> 06:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about
 
06:13:38.948 --> 06:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative leus and then gr I just
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to the list that
 
06:13:42.670 --> 06:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative groa uh made is that we
 
06:13:44.590 --> 06:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh passed a bill on reciprocity or
 
06:13:46.830 --> 06:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
licensed by endorsement last year and
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process is underway so
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
there's also that okay yes and since
 
06:13:56.788 --> 06:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be um licensing by
 
06:13:59.948 --> 06:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
privilege that also gives this time
 
06:14:01.948 --> 06:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
because people no matter what people
 
06:14:04.590 --> 06:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
have to come here and ask for privilege
 
06:14:04.600 --> 06:14:06.110 align:start position:0%
have to come here and ask for privilege
so

06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
that makes it a different type of
 
06:14:10.190 --> 06:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
compact not realizing that these are all
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
different kinds I think this is actually
 
06:14:15.310 --> 06:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
something that allows New Hampshire to
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
sit back and
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
wait and I wish I had known about I wish
 
06:14:20.910 --> 06:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
I had known about these kinds of
 
06:14:20.920 --> 06:14:22.430 align:start position:0%
I had known about these kinds of
compacts

06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
compacts
 
06:14:22.440 --> 06:14:24.110 align:start position:0%
compacts
earlier

06:14:24.110 --> 06:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:14:24.120 --> 06:14:26.110 align:start position:0%
earlier
okay

06:14:26.110 --> 06:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
ring thank you madam chair and I'll be
 
06:14:31.948 --> 06:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl
 
06:14:36.670 --> 06:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
um these compacts just keep coming one
 
06:14:38.310 --> 06:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
after another like representative Simon
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
said earlier it's all of a sudden
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to be or wants to be in
 
06:14:41.878 --> 06:14:42.670 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to be or wants to be in
a

06:14:42.670 --> 06:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:14:45.868 --> 06:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
compact but we have yet
 
06:14:47.910 --> 06:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
to truly
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
see the full impact these compacts have
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
had we've heard that information out
 
06:14:54.788 --> 06:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
there is still new as to what's going on
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
and what's happening
 
06:14:57.680 --> 06:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
and what's happening
um

06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
and this truly is not a compact yet
 
06:15:04.990 --> 06:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
because they haven't formed in St
 
06:15:08.190 --> 06:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
started working for it um so we're
 
06:15:09.788 --> 06:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
signing up for something that we don't
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
know is going to happen like we've done
 
06:15:14.110 --> 06:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
with numerous other compacts which I
 
06:15:16.350 --> 06:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
wish we would have held off before we
 
06:15:19.070 --> 06:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
get into um for th those reasons I'll be
 
06:15:22.110 --> 06:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl okay representative
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair um I wish
 
06:15:27.910 --> 06:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
I had all the history that all of you
 
06:15:29.468 --> 06:15:29.478 align:start position:0%
folks do that makes it a little bit
 
06:15:30.948 --> 06:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
easier for you to think about these
 
06:15:30.958 --> 06:15:33.468 align:start position:0%
easier for you to think about these
things

06:15:33.468 --> 06:15:33.478 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
um because
 
06:15:37.070 --> 06:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
for myself I'd like to talk about it
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
more and and learn more um I I hesitate
 
06:15:43.548 --> 06:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
just to vote itl because I just don't
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
know enough the fact that this maybe
 
06:15:48.468 --> 06:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
this would not help some of our veterans
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
and some of our our uh our residents
 
06:15:53.230 --> 06:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
that are out of state for a short amount
 
06:15:58.350 --> 06:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
of time so I I I I don't feel like I'm
 
06:15:59.628 --> 06:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
well enough
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
informed can I tell you representative
 
06:16:04.990 --> 06:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair uh
 
06:16:06.030 --> 06:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I'd love to have a
 
06:16:07.750 --> 06:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
C cup of coffee with you sometime we can
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
take an hour and talk over these
 
06:16:14.590 --> 06:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
things well actually the the point is
 
06:16:17.548 --> 06:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
that director Courtney specifically said
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
it takes a couple of years to get it
 
06:16:23.230 --> 06:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
going and so if we were to join the
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
compact in a year or two that would give
 
06:16:28.708 --> 06:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
you time to research and give them time
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
to develop the compact so that we do
 
06:16:35.350 --> 06:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
know what we're we're agreeing to um
 
06:16:37.070 --> 06:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
a not a a statement that we never want
 
06:16:43.230 --> 06:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
to join this compact it's a statement
 
06:16:44.948 --> 06:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
that we don't think it's in the best
 
06:16:47.190 --> 06:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the state this
 
06:16:49.750 --> 06:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
year that's that's fair thank you
 
06:16:51.468 --> 06:16:51.478 align:start position:0%
represent sorry a serious comment this
 
06:16:53.390 --> 06:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
time I think the other thing to keep in
 
06:16:55.468 --> 06:16:55.478 align:start position:0%
in mind when we're looking at this is
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
and it's mid mentioned already I just
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't can't remember when we've done
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
such a tremendous amount of work over
 
06:17:04.430 --> 06:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
the last two years to make it really
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
really really easy to get a license in
 
06:17:09.510 --> 06:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
this state and we have reciprocity in
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
the works we have expediated lure in the
 
06:17:14.270 --> 06:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
works we have the veterans bills that
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've been working on in the works we've
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
got a lot of irons in the fire and none
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
of them have landed yet like and to
 
06:17:22.990 --> 06:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
allow our own systems that we've put in
 
06:17:24.548 --> 06:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
place to solidify while we're waiting to
 
06:17:26.510 --> 06:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
see what compact looks like just to me
 
06:17:29.390 --> 06:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
seems like Common
 
06:17:31.628 --> 06:17:31.638 align:start position:0%
