Amendment uh 2023
2429

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
2429
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
to the uh committee via email
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%

represent Sullivan you recognized to
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you um it's
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
been a long haul
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and um essentially the difference
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
between this amendment and the amendment
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
we were looking at last week is um in
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the first section section one and
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's the buold print
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
um it the bull print reads employers
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
shall provide employees a level of
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
protection that is at least as effective
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
as a level of protection set forth in
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
27716 um this means that at no time will
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
um public sector employers and employees
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
be um responsible for safety standards
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
that are anything other than what is in
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor rules um
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
so as the department goes through the
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
exercise of U adopting new rules to uh
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
be at least effective as the OSHA
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
standards in the meantime all of the uh
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh public sector will continue to
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
operate under the current um safety
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
standards and so it'll be a gradual over
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
period of three years there would be a
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
gradual um uh replacement and shift from
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh the current safety standards to
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
standards that are at least as effective
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
as the OSHA standards so um this uh
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
corrected a potential problem where we
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
we feared that maybe people would think
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
they were um responsible for the OSHA
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
standard starting in 60 days that was
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
not the intent and I think now the
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
language makes it very clear that the um
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be a rolling adoption over the
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
course of uh 3 years and it'll be
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
between the Department of Labor and Jael
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
car to uh gradually make that shift and
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of three years we will have a
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
set of um uh standards that is at least
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
as effective as OSHA
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
19 um so that's uh what this new
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment does the rest of these um
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
components are exactly the same as they
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
were last week um I'm going to forego
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
going through that whole thing again I'd
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer questions if people
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
have them but uh I I I think it was just
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
a week ago we went through the whole
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
thing so I'm going to avoid the um
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other hands I do support
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment was brought
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
to our attention by individuals from the
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh Association of counties and it was a
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
very good point uh this makes uh the
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill better uh it explains it better um
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the members to support
 
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the members to support
the

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%

chair it's rare
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
representan I would like to move a to
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
pass as amended motion on the floor is
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended as a second and
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
um I think it's as I said it's been a
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
long time coming essentially we have uh
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
a set of uh department of labor
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
standards that um have gone long
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
neglected um it was acknowledged by
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
former uh deputies um commissioner Ogden
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
that um the U it' Been at least 10 years
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
since these have been updated um when
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
the department did a detailed comparison
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
between the do standards and the ocean
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
1910 standards it was very clear that
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
they were gaping holes in the current
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
standards and um there are certain
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
aspects that
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh um desperately needed to be filled in
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
so um this bill does fill that in as I
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
said a few minutes ago it fills them in
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
gradually over the course of three years
 
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
gradually over the course of three years
that

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
um process that uh implementation um
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
method was recommended by the Department
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
of Labor um and I thank them for their
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
assistance with this because what what I
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
asked for is an implementation that
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
would work for the department and work
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
for employers and I believe that is what
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
um has been accomplished here so um
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
I urge uh the committee to support the U
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
today I am OSHA 10 certified I do
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
believe in safety unfortunately I've
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
told some of you that in my job as an
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
insurance agent I've had three deaths on
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
construction sites that I was involved
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
with with as an insurance agent for so
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
when this was brought to my attention I
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
was very eager to get involved and um
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
sat down with um representative Sullivan
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
and then the committee
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
and probably other than one other
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill for workers compensation 10 years
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
ago is probably the most
 
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
ago is probably the most
thorough

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
um analysis of the entire situation that
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
I've probably gone through on any
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
particular bill here in the in the labor
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee I think that what was agreed
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
to by the
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um which was unanimous
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats is what's in
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
front of you um was a probably the best
 
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
effort yet to try to get something done
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:28.730 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.910 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
the sorry I'm thinking
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
here the way that I'm I'm being told by
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
folks that this bill doesn't have a
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
chance it's not going to pass as is
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association is against the
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh my own um Department of Public
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
Works in Manchester um has said to me
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
why is the legislature getting involved
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
with this it doesn't belong with the
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
legislature belongs with the Department
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
of Labor
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
I had a senator call me and said whatat
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
are you doing go whatever you do we're
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to kill it in the Senate so I
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't like passing legislation that I
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
know is not going to
 
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.710 align:start position:0%
know is not going to
pass

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
um so what are the options available
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
well we can go back to study I don't
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
think that's the right thing to
 
00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:19.150 align:start position:0%
think that's the right thing to
do

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'm betwix and between I have
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
uh my city officer telling me he doesn't
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
want it
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
um associations that I know are going to
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
be against it so
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't like any of
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
them and it's a little disheartening for
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of time and
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
effort that has been put into this and I
 
00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
effort that has been put into this and I
I

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh need
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
to applaud representative selin for the
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the time he has put
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
in but I think we need door number three
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that I have a door War
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
number three
um

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
so I am not going to support the final
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm going to support another
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
future Amendment and I'm
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that the silence quietness of
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
telling me this is not going to pass
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
that people come up with what they want
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
what is going to pass I mean we've been
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
doing this for six or seven months
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
um I would have liked it to have been
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
out on the table as to what it should
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
be um maybe that is the department going
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
back and and doing what they've done for
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know 50 plus years and
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
I don't know 50 plus years and
revamping

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
revamping
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
their um safety manual something closer
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh to what we need
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
um it's it's difficult you know some
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
will say well
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's the repres it's the
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative's obligation It's A
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
legislature to push it through and then
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
the Departments have to deal with
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
whatever we push through to
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
them um yeah that's one way of
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislating um but um this is too
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
big um not to have everyone on board so
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
with massive regret I will not be
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill uh and hopes that
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
between now and the time that this hits
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
the floor someone has a better idea or
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of the people that are going to not
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
support it come up with a a way to
 
00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
support it come up with a a way to
support

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.390 align:start position:0%
support
it

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
um so that is my two
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
cents any other
 
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.669 align:start position:0%
cents any other
comments

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
McKenzie um Mr chair I have been
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
involved in uh workers compensation for
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
better in 40 years I've sat in a number
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
of commissions I've been in the in the
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
room when deals were negotiated for
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
workers compensation over the course of
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
many years and I can tell you uh with
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
fair amount of
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
confidence that the question of this
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
Safety Committee was a deal that was cut
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
between the business and industry and
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
all the groups as part of a deal to
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
lower workers compensation rates in the
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we were when we started
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
through this process in the early 90s
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
and I've asked you and you agreed to get
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
Christine grant our research at take a
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
look at this where we were was there was
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
nobody who would write workers
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
compensation in the state of New
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there was one carrier as you
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
remember there are 28
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
now the difference between where we were
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
then and where we are now is that there
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
were significant changes made as part of
 
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.990 align:start position:0%
were significant changes made as part of
a

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
deal and part of that deal was workers
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
lost things lost benefits and part of
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
the tradeoff for losing those benefits
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and I can when this research comes
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
out we can put this on the table and
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
you'll understand but let me give you
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
just one example what work has lost they
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
went from 66 and 23 to 60% of their pay
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
now it's the municipal Association or
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
the County Association is not raising
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
that but that was a significant
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost to
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
employers the Qui pro quo for those
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
kinds of things was to give us a solid
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
safety and health program so we're not
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
negotiate we're not talking about a new
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
program that's coming up we're simply
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
talking about updating the standards for
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the program that was already already we
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
already agreed to many many years ago
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
and let me say this and you look at the
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
at the incidence of workers compensation
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Mr chairman you're
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
closer to this than I am what you've
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
seen as a mock reduction in the number
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
of injuries in workplaces and that's a
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
result of this program
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
the safety and health program so all
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is taking a standard
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
that it's old and tired and simply
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
upgrading the standard and that's what
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
this is that's what this is about now
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
for people to push back and say and I'm
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what the objection is
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the Minal Association but if it's
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
about money then there's two sides of
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
the equation there's two sides of that
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
one side is what we gave up and one side
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
is what they saved and you've got to
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
take when you look at the cost of
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
workers compensation you have to take
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
both of those into consideration and
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
this system is it's a reasonable system
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
it is save people money it's in a place
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
where we have 28 carriers in New
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from going from one to 28 so
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
this has worked and worked well and so I
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
hope when we take this this vote and we
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
take this take this into
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
consideration that everybody gave up
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
something to get to where we are today
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
and all we're asking for is simply
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
update the standard like they do for the
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
electrical code like they do for the
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
plumbus code like they do for other
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state of that's all
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're asking for this is not we're not
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
asking to startop this all over again
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
this is already in the law so Mr
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I hope that when we go through
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
this and we think about this that we
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
really takeing consideration how we got
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
to this place and the deals that we made
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
to get to this place and make sure that
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
public sector workers have a solid
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
program that that will protect them as
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
they do in the private sector protect
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
them as they do in the private sector
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
and not have two people working side by
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
side one covered by ocean one covered by
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
a weak law that's 20 years old thank you
 
00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:38.230 align:start position:0%
a weak law that's 20 years old thank you

chair I call you madam chair you did and
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
I don't mind Madam Clerk
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to say
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
that um representative Sullivan and I
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
have worked with um an organization that
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
is um looking at employee rights and
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
protections in worker safety and know
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
the story of at least one person who
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
died because um one of our towns decided
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
to save money in a really dumb way and
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
this gentleman lost his life so to
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
exempt public employees from OSHA
 
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.630 align:start position:0%
exempt public employees from OSHA
allows

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
um has has opened the door unfortunately
 
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.590 align:start position:0%
um has has opened the door unfortunately
for

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
situations where for lack of a better
 
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.230 align:start position:0%
situations where for lack of a better
word

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
inept managers middle managers have made
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
choices of money over safety and it
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
would not have saved that much money
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
to have saved that gentleman's life to
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
do a safer way of
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
transporting um this equipment that
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
needed to be transported twice a year I
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm certain this isn't the only incident
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
where a town or city has tried to save
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
money or the state has tried to save
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
money and instead it's at the expense of
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
worker safety and I think this is just
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
an a simple issue of
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
fairness and I believe our public
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
employees deserve at a
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
minimum um the basic right to have the
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
same safety laws that our public sector
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
already has and I think they should that
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
it does ensure that
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
um bad decisions of to to compromise
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
safety won't be made and therefore I
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
drao thank you Mr
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
chair on paper it seems like a really
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
good idea this bill the way it's ritten
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
because right now we have two sets of
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
rules good for thee not for me as a
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
private sector employee my employees are
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
held to a different standard than public
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
sector so part of it says you need to do
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
that but we don't and um and I think we
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
can all agree that safety is should be
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
the concern for everybody it doesn't
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
matter what your who your employer is
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
everybody should kind of be held to the
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
same standard the problem and I don't
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
know how we fix this but the problem
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
really is the amount that it costs each
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh and our constitution
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
says you cannot mandate expand a program
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
provide a new law without having to fund
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
it on a municipality so therefore we're
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
voting on something that is
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and no matter how I
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
feel about it because I do care about
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
the employees and I want everybody to be
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
safe and have the same playing field if
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
it's against the Constitution I just I
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.549 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan with regard to the unfunded
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
mandate um as I understand it the courts
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
have been pretty clear about this that
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
if we were
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
creating safety standards for the first
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
time ever um that could be considered an
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate but because there are
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
there is a program of um public sector
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
safety through the Department of Labor
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
we are not creating something entirely
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
new and therefore it is not a
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional U bill it uh simply
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
makes adjustments the department can
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to the rules as it is
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
now um the department has always worked
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
with um uh public sector employers um
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
around budget issues where if there's a
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
violation of the safety standards um
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
they they've simply said we're going to
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
have to fix this and I we understand
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
you've you may need to deal with it
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
through your budgeting process so we
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
will have an interim fix and a permanent
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
fix that will come once you can U deal
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
with the budgeting but this has been
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
going on for uh for decades so it's
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
um um maintaining safety does cost there
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
have been many um studies done by OSHA
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
to show that improving safety saves
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
money in the long term it dramatically
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
saves money so we are not just saving
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
injuries saving lives we're also in the
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
long run saving money for the public
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
sector in New Hampshire thank
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
you representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um a number of times as we've
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill we've gotten wound
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
up on this issue of the of 28a and and
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
um and how a court might rule if it came
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
before them I've started trying to think
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
about this a little more simply on after
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
I got home last week uh after our
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee I had waiting for me the tax
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill for this year's property
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and um it was up a decent bit and
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
when I looked on Facebook there was a
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
lot of angry people in the town about uh
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
why the taxes were raised
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
and um to me maybe that's a simpler way
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
of looking at at it what is going to be
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
this impact the impact of this on my
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxes what's it going to be on the
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
people who voted for me on their taxes
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
and part of the answer is I'm not sure
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
um as represent representative suvin
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
just pointed out there may be uh some
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
benefits as well as cost
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
um depending on how this is implemented
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
it could have more or less of an impact
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
on the towns on the county whose budget
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm also responsible for
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
um but we don't know this is a a request
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
well we'll throw it out there and we'll
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
see what comes out and and we'll deal
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
with it when it does and I'm as the
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
chairman pointed out I'm un comfortable
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
with that I've
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
heard the voices that maybe didn't come
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
before the subcommittee but are out
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
there that are are concerned with that
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason although I voted
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
for the amendment I'm going to be unable
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
to support the
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
otpa and I've
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
also because I also feel like I don't
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
want to um discard the hard work that
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
the department has done that this
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee has done um in speaking with
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
I've come up with what might be a door
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
number three and if this otpa does not
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
succeed then I'll offer a further
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair um I know our
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
taxes went up too and it's not because
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
of this because this hasn't even
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
happened we just have taxes going up
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
because the state doesn't pay for things
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
that maybe it should like
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
education but when we think about safety
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
and how we how our own our own uh
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
workers comp rates you know have gone
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
down year after year because we've
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
improved safety and our labor department
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
wants to improve safety it's kind of
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
stunning that the Public Works people in
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I don't know about I
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to night Public Works guy
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
but I think he'd like to improve safety
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
rather than uh so don't bother me with
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
this legisl
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
so uh I think we should pass the bill
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I hope that people can be persuaded
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
to support it when it gets to the other
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
body uh because as we continue to have U
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
life you know life-changing injuries or
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
deaths it's it costs somebody and it
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
more it's more than our tax bill thank
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair repr
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chair um as someone
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
who has had uh you know a life-changing
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
injury in work um you know the work of
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
safety is uh is uh pretty Dar important
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
to me and uh it' certainly get my vote
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
if this was a budget year you know where
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
we could make a provision in the budget
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for all this and uh you know
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
everything it go through smooth but
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not a budget year uh
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to to support this next year
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
um but um this year I can't because uh
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's an
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional mandate on on our
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
counties representative k Mr chair if I
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
may reply to representative love uh this
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
is something the labor department will
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
work over on a period of years so
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly we're going to have a budget
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
year or two before much of this is has
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
taken effect so um I think it's worth
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.990 align:start position:0%
taken effect so um I think it's worth
doing

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
chairman some of what we heard uh in the
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
arguments supporting this bill is that
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Labor already
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
regulates safety that we simply want
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
them to upgrade the standard we've heard
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
how uh how it's worked how it's worked
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
well um that the the the costs and the
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
safety in incidents have gone down year
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
after year um something the chairman U
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me offline is that our
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a better safety
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
record than Private Industry uh when you
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
when when you look at the rates
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
um so what I tried to do here is come up
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that recognizes all
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
those facts and does exactly that ask
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to work within
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
their existing Authority and simply
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
upgrade the
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
Elan I appreciate the sentiment of the
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um it however provides no
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
guidance whatsoever to the department as
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
to how to go about upgrading its uh
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
safety standards um the department has
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
been left to its own devices for years
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
now and without any guidance from the
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has not upgraded its safety
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
standards um so I would suggest that
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
simply saying we're going to give you
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
three positions and and a little bit of
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
money to uh take out of uh the funds
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
that the department has available um it
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't give them any guidance as to how
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
to go about um uh changing the standards
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
so um I don't see that this would
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
make much if any improvement over our
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
just a committee works very well with
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and Department
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
of Employment Securities and uh probably
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
better uh or
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
or I don't say better than any other
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
Committee in in the Departments but we
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
work very well together with them and I
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
do have a trust in them and and quite
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
frankly maybe they have to dig deep and
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
and bring in another person and bring in
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
a safety uh person and look at the other
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
States and what they're doing and and
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
upgrade it without question I will agree
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
with you 100% my colleagues on the left
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
side of
 
00:38:06.319 --> 00:38:07.870 align:start position:0%
side of
me

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
um that we need to upgrade the safety um
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
you asked me representative kale you
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
made a comment about
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester um yes uh Mr Clardy uh from
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Works um does
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
not like the
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislature getting involved and and was
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of of the department
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
doing something Manchester is very lucky
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
they do have a safety officer who
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
manages all this and their workers comp
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
claims are down 45% from three years ago
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
because they got rid of the they they
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
now have the trash barrels picked up
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
machine um repr wasent McKenzie talked
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
about the reduction in in claims and and
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
the workers comp rates going down down a
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
lot of it has to do with man New
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's use of
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
Technology uh to do things uh using
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
machines versus people's backs and and
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
other things um I did look at uh the
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
reports representative kcom had asked um
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
for review of claims and I and I looked
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
at where a lot of the claims were coming
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
from and there bumps and bruises there
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
are uh back injuries back strains
 
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.309 align:start position:0%
are uh back injuries back strains
shoulder

00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
shoulder
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
strains um and a lot of these things
 
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.550 align:start position:0%
strains um and a lot of these things
um

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so this a very easy place to kind of
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
pinpoint some of the things that need to
 
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
pinpoint some of the things that need to
be

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
done I had requested that representative
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
seaworth come up with some kind of an
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment because I do not want this
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
to this issue to
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
die um it needs to be upgraded it needs
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'd rather have some available
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism um so it doesn't
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't die so depending on
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
whatever happens in the
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
house if someone decides to go to the
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
Senate to try to deep six it um there's
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
another mechanism already available that
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
came out of at least even if it was a TI
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
1010 in the committee there is at least
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
another mechanism available um as a as
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
some kind of a compromise um because I
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
don't have any other me me ISM that I
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
could think of other than another study
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee which I don't want to
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
do um I think we've done
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
it um and that is the purpose and that
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
is why I requested that uh
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth come up with
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
something that I I could
 
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
something that I I could
support

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
