representative oberger who who does the
 
00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.070 align:start position:0%
representative oberger who who does the
first

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm actually going
 
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
to move
 
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we exceed to the senate for
 
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
category one changes i will speak to
 
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
that briefly if i get a second
 
00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
tracie representative will second that
 
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
if i might speak to this briefly i'm
 
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
wearing a red dress
 
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
i mean a green dress because i'm always
 
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
i'm jealous of the senate you always
 
00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
have more money than we have
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
we're always facing smaller revenues and
 
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
most of these changes that you guys made
 
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
were things that we pushed just because
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
we were short of money
 
00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh there were changes to the department
 
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
of information technology that needed to
 
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
some of that relates to the creation of
 
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
the new department of energy
 
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's page one if you look at page two
 
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at admin services
 
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
we concur with all of those changes the
 
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing board
 
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
we do those the office of the
 
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
child advocate funds a full legal time
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
aid and an
 
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
assistant that we did not have money for
 
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
you actually removed two audit positions
 
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we had in
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
because we needed the revenue from the
 
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
additional audit positions we're okay
 
00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
debt service is something that had to to
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the total changes
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
they amounted to for the biennium
 
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty one thousand dollars
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%

six the department of military affairs
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
zero department of agriculture
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
no change we've now moved to page
 
00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.589 align:start position:0%
no change we've now moved to page
seven

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
we are in agreement there was a
 
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
movement of a position in the insurance
 
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
movement of a position in the insurance
department

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission restored 20
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement positions
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom and then we have
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the newly created
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy on page eight
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
in the department corrections on page
 
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
in the department corrections on page
nine

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
we restore a position that we did not
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
have funding for
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
which brings us to the bottom of page 10
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
because the summary funds
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
are on 9 and 10 and these changes
 
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
amount to two million one hundred eight
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and the house succeeds
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the senate position
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
i will move that motion second
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
motion in a second for those pages that
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you i'm not going to
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
vote no on this but i just want to
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
mention that i think we
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
lost an opportunity by not funding any
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
of the teacher positions at the
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
because most of these inmates are going
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
to get out and
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
they'll be more successful if they're
 
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.070 align:start position:0%
they'll be more successful if they're
educated

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
educated
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
and career worthy if i could respond to
 
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
and career worthy if i could respond to
that

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
yes we we funded
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
when the budget came to us the governor
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
had cut six million dollars in the
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
education and training the house
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
replaced that with five million dollars
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we funded the majority of those
 
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
so we funded the majority of those
teachers

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
i also at the time talked to
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner helen hanks now that we
 
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner helen hanks now that we
have

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
newer prisons with more computer
 
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
newer prisons with more computer
technology

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
many of the things that our prisoners do
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the offerings through v-lacs one of
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
our charter schools that's virtual
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
that now does sixth grade seventh grade
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
eighth grade
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
up through high school and so she felt
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
she could
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
with the positions that were funded
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
because there were only i think three
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
positions unfunded but the remainder
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
were funded
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
she could use the new technology with
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you when the
 
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.590 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you when the
commissioner

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
came to the senate she requested
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
us to restore funding for six positions
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
that were unfunded
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
two of which were filled so we will be
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
eliminating two active
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner told me that those
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
positions were now vacant
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know where they were when she
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
came to you i just called in
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
last week and asked her if we had
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
managed to fund all her field positions
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
and everything else was
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
vacant and she did tell me yes so
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald i don't know what she
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%

i did double check with her
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
well we did make an important change
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
after a 300 page
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
audit on the liquor commission
 
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.950 align:start position:0%

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
convinced that
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
they had had proper attention to that
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh i'll speak for me personally uh
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
we did receive a lot of feedback from
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
from businesses who
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%

continue to have these positions
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
that their audit was not
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
satisfactory uh i believe that notice
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%

for what they have done on safety
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%

positions
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
from the house and um
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
we were lucky if we were able to
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
do things that they needed to be done
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
but we did not have the
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
financial availability to
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh add these positions so
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%

wanted

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you mr
chair

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i i'd like to do this a little bit
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
differently than the my predecessors
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
have just
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
done this um i uh
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start on on page 20
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
and and just uh note a few things and
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
and ask some questions about
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
the the bigger items uh for for example
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh the senate has agreed with us that
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
ought to be closed in the coming budget
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
allocate an additional eight months for
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
for that work to be done
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
and you've you've changed how the
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
funding looks
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
you've done nine million dollars per
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we put money in the first year and
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
none in the
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
in the second so i'm i'm
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
i would just like to hear uh your
 
00:14:59.279 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
i would just like to hear uh your
thought

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
on uh why the extra eight months and
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
and what the sense of commitment is on
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
the part of the senate
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think we were all in agreement uh with
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
the closure of it
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh what we needed to do was to provide
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time for things to
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
to get in place uh to to transfer it
 
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.150 align:start position:0%
to get in place uh to to transfer it
over

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
to closure and we set the budget up
 
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.269 align:start position:0%
to closure and we set the budget up
accordingly

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and and then are you
 
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and and then are you
anticipating

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
any uh reviews uh by the legislature
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
over the coming 20 months or so to
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
i don't recall that we talked about
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
that but but i would expect that uh if
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
we set in place a closure date
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
that uh someone the department
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
or the legislature or both uh could
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
monit monitor it
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh certainly that uh could be brought
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
forward in legislation
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
one of your questions representative
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
edward was about the spend
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
on and and why we put the nine or nine
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars in each year
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
and looking at the historical dollar
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
amounts especially
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
in 2020 um and looking back to
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the work that the um i know that the
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
house has done
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
on this issue and looking at what
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually needs to be spent
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the for the number of children at
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
the sununu services center we felt that
 
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
the sununu services center we felt that
was

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
a reasonable number to put in for the
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
budget as far as looking
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
at how it's going to be going forward
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
the commission that was put in
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
hb2 i believe can monitor the
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
the closure and and the timeline and how
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion then uh
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
to a seed to the senate physician but i
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to go from um
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
from rows one to row
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
48 row 48 ends on page 23
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
and then because i i have some
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay a motion and a second that the
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
house exceed
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the senate position on
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the health and human services so that
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
page 20 through 23 was it
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
9 48 on on page 23. yes sir thank you
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion in those areas
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
representative rosenwald do you want to
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
have any further discussion
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
by senator roosevelt excuse me
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
you must want your title right um
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not comfortable with the
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money on line 34
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
which is the um
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
sorry line 22 the housing shelter
 
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
sorry line 22 the housing shelter
program

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
on page 20. um not only does this
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
not include the
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
prioritized need for that the department
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
asked for to increase the shelter
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate and we've had
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
how we might appropriate federal funds
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
through fiscal i spoke with the
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner just
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
like an hour ago and she said the
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
department still
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
did not have firm plans for
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
how to fund or what to put in
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i i think it's more emergent than
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
just letting it go but in
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
addition the amount of money contained
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
within this
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
line when we did add three million
 
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
line when we did add three million
dollars

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's for our separate programs
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
is actually a cut of 862
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars versus the current biennium and
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
um i think we're just going to be in
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
greater trouble with the homeless
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
problem that we have if we
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't even bring the
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
next biennium up to where we've been
 
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
next biennium up to where we've been
this

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
budget so so i'm not able to support
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
this motion
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey thank you uh
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler i have a question for
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you can you talk to us about this
 
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:54.230 align:start position:0%
thank you can you talk to us about this
line

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
and if this 1.5 per fiscal year
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
is an improvement over the last biennium
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
or if it's if there's still a cut in
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
there somehow
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay i can turn this over to uh kevin
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
who looked into that class line
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
so to be clear we're talking about line
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
sure and i'm looking up this accounting
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
unit now i believe with the addition of
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
it is an increase over the previous
 
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.270 align:start position:0%
it is an increase over the previous
biennium

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
um what the department had stated though
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
was that there was a contract line
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
in there that was artificially low
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
because of the way fiscal 21 was
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
calculated so that's what senator
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
rosenwald is referencing
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
the overall amount in that accounting
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
unit though for general funds is higher
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you a question
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
for the lba
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so the shelter contract line
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
isn't that lower if you were
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
7927

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.840 --> 00:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
fast

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
so yes actually if you look at class 102
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is where the funding would go and
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is where the senate added 1.5
 
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
which is where the senate added 1.5
million

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
there is a reduction in 2223 from the
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
2021 budget
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
i believe that's a reallocation of funds
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
from from class line 102 to class 74
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
because there's a big increase in 74.
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
so i may in order to give you a
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
definitive answer i may need to check in
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
with the department on this but yes if
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at class 102 in isolation
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is lower in 2223 than it was in
 
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.909 align:start position:0%
that is lower in 2223 than it was in
2021

00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey thank you just to
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
follow up on that can for those
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
of people listening can you just explain
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
what class 74 is
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that the contracts line
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
class 24 is grants for public assistance
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
and relief
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh so there was a significant increase
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
in that class line
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
from the last biennium and a significant
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
decrease in class 102 contracts for
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
mr chair for discussion purposes we saw
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
that a lot
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
in dhhs's budget where they switched
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
between those two class lines over this
 
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
between those two class lines over this
biennium

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
so this is not unusual
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
anything further on discussion we have a
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
motion to accept
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
up through line or up for you
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
up through line 48 true line 48.
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
house members um voting for the amen
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor of the motion
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
all right motion passes
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay moving on representative edwards uh
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to ask the senate about
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
line 50 the tobacco prevention and
 
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.630 align:start position:0%
line 50 the tobacco prevention and
secession

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
secession
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
number i i don't recall this
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget i do recall
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing about it in division iii and a
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
request for us to add it
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i remember our conversation around
 
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
and i remember our conversation around
this

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
was that the testimony
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
did not indicate that there was any uh
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that this money was actually uh
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
being effective in terms of uh reducing
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
the rate at which
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh people are smoking in our society
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
and and so because we we couldn't find
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
any evidence
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
um to support it we we didn't
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't support this program and and
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
um what what the what the thought
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
process is of
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
adding this money back from what the
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
house had
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
as we as we went through particularly
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
the hhs budget
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
we recognized that there were multiple
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
areas that we really didn't know if they
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
were being effective or not
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we were trying
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
to do was to address the immediate needs
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
secondly we are trying to address uh
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
the root cause of some of those things
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
so so recognizing that tobacco was one
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
fell into that category where we really
 
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
fell into that category where we really
didn't

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
have all the information we needed um we
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
vacate it and just let it run but
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
i know at least it's my intent over the
 
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:08.950 align:start position:0%
i know at least it's my intent over the
next

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
year and a half to be monitoring these
 
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
year and a half to be monitoring these
programs

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
so that as we go into the next biennium
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
we know what's working and not working
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i raise that question numerous times
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh during the presentation by hhs
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
as to how they define success in a
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
program so this this is something that i
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be following through on the
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
tobacco as well
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for that uh that
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
response i i can relate to that um
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
if if i may um mr chair i
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
i would like to drop down to line 63
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
and just just note that on line 63 and
 
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.269 align:start position:0%
and just just note that on line 63 and
64.

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
i just got a text mr chair that we're
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
are we failing to live stream
 
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.909 align:start position:0%
are we failing to live stream
technicians

00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes all right do we need to stop
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
karen and i probably knew what was
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
coming so we spent hours with our
 
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.710 align:start position:0%
coming so we spent hours with our
buckets

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
buckets
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
going over making sure we had everything
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're live now mike or we lost
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
money might change
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
we are not in a recess we are in a break
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
let me make that clear recesses require
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
us to
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
all right i guess we're waiting for the
 
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.310 align:start position:0%
all right i guess we're waiting for the
youtube

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
youtube
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
section to be restored but we are
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
as we are on break waiting to
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
degrees

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:28.230 align:start position:0%

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:50.069 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm always picky about these because
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
because i don't get them because they
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
no one can no one will get on the
 
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
no one can no one will get on the
contract

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.839 --> 00:36:10.829 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:38.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
