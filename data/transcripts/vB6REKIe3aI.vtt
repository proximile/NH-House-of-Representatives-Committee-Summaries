00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
yep yep yep okay so and it's and it's
 
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
understandable I think that they don't
 
00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
want to have to they only have so much
 
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
money to invest and they don't want to
 
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
have to invest it necessarily everywhere
 
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
if there are other uh means of uh for
 
00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 align:start position:0%
people to con to connect available so if
 
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's Wireless available or if there's
 
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
Internet available you know why invest
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
in putting in a a phone line that maybe
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary
 
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and that does seem like a legitimate
 
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 align:start position:0%
um purpose to me at least the concern
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
that that I had listening to the
 
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and that I that I still have
 
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
is how do you make sure that
 
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.309 align:start position:0%
is how do you make sure that
um

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
that the people that
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know that people that that you know
 
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
um that you're not leaving anybody
 
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
um that you're not leaving anybody
behind

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
um you know and and then the process and
 
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that there is a clear
 
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
process of uh explaining to people that
 
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
they potentially are going to lose their
 
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
phone service that they have to uh find
 
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 align:start position:0%
phone service that they have to uh find
Alternatives

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
Alternatives
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
um that that type of stuff
 
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
um you know so what what I tried to do
 
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.790 align:start position:0%
um you know so what what I tried to do
was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
there has been some work done on this in
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
in Maine
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I took a look at that and what I
 
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
tried to do in this in this you know
 
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment and I'll just say
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
right off the bat that um there's no
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
pride of authorship here I just put this
 
00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
together as a way to kind of get things
 
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
going but was trying to first of all
 
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.589 align:start position:0%
going but was trying to first of all
Define

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
Define
 
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 align:start position:0%
okay so how what what specific criteria
 
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
are we going to use to determine you
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.410 align:start position:0%
know whether
um

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
potentially a phone company could
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
petition to loot to be relieved of the
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
um carrier of Last Resort so you know
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
and you know what map is going to be
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
used and and kind of what are the
 
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.430 align:start position:0%
used and and kind of what are the
criteria

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
there is a map that's being developed by
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Business
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs I understand that
 
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
they've asked for the data uh yesterday
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to publish it at the
 
00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 align:start position:0%
end of the month and just you know I
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
thought it would make sense in the
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
legislation to say okay you got to use
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to use this map as the basis
 
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
for determining whether whether a
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
petition can be filed and then I stuck
 
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
with the the language that's in the bill
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
right now the 95 percent of households
 
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
that have access to
 
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.129 align:start position:0%
that have access to
um

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:40.969 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
mobile or or Internet and 97 percent
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the 95 and the 97 I left that
 
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
in there and then
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
um I also left in the language about you
 
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.290 align:start position:0%
um I also left in the language about you
know

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.010 align:start position:0%
know
um

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know areas where there's Federal
 
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
funding available to upgrade the um the
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
internet service and then basically just
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
put in some criteria some some steps in
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
terms of notification how people have to
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
be notified
 
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
um essentially it's
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
the the people have to be notified
 
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
the the people have to be notified
um

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
in their in their bill that this is
 
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.610 align:start position:0%
in their in their bill that this is
happening

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a public hearing
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and then the doe has to make a final
 
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
decision within a certain period of time
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
um so that's really what this amendment
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
um it still it doesn't get at the issue
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm still struggling with is okay
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
what happens about what happens in that
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
situation where there's that you know
 
00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
and I you know that that that one person
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
in a valley somewhere that you know has
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
a phone line but doesn't have access to
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
Internet or mobile I mean what happens
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
to that person I I don't know how you
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
address that one
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps but that's kind of
 
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the money's for the federal monies that
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
went to each County but they each got a
 
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
check by population so we had gotten
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
like 3.3 million up in kowas County so
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
the first investment we took with any of
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that money was to do the Broadband map
 
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
we just got it back a week ago up north
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's none of none of my with the
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
Lancaster District thing on it so I'm
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
still trying to find out there's another
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
one coming out I don't know what the
 
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
other one is is this one or what because
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
I know there's a couple of maps that
 
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
have been being done right now so that
 
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
was the big investment was to make sure
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know what was the Broadband studies
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
so we had
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
we had invested a couple hundred
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
thousand a couple hundred thousand and
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
put up there so
 
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.309 align:start position:0%
put up there so
um

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
it's a work in progress
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
if you go you know I went to the um the
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
Affairs website and
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
um they they have a they they have a
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
page where they're talking about you
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
know the mapping that's being done
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
um and that's from what I understand and
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
there may be people here that can
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
comment on that but from what I
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
understand that's supposed to be the
 
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
definitive map
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh replacing all the other Maps but I I
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
Sarah Davis with Consolidated
 
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.350 align:start position:0%
Sarah Davis with Consolidated
Communications

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the Bea went out to
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
bid for somebody to perform mapping the
 
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire won that bid
 
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
and Carol Miller is sort of leading that
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
and all of the providers in the state
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
are providing data as of yesterday we
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
had to file data with the FCC as of
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
yesterday so it might take us a day or
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
two to get it over to her but within the
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
next few days she'll be getting that and
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
and they're using that to put together a
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide map as we understand it the
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire was not keen on
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
the idea of accepting the FCC map they
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
want to produce their own and so that's
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the New Hampshire map if
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
you will although based largely on the
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
same data because providers are already
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.329 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
um does that include does that include
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
broadband and wireless access as well or
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
is it just landline access
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I I know for sure it includes
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
Broadband access I'm not sure and I I
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to guess on exactly how
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
they're mapping wireless wireless is
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
always a bit tricky there are Wireless
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
Maps available but I'm just not positive
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
what they're doing with respect to that
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
probably a better question for the
 
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.570 align:start position:0%
probably a better question for the
agency

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.410 align:start position:0%
agency
um

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
quick question for you the um I know a
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
lot of cable companies internet
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
companies they provide both internet and
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
phone together
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
um do you find that you uh do you is
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
that one some of the things you offer to
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
most towns or all your pro to all the
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
tones you provide for both internet and
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
phone yeah so can Consolidated is a
 
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.430 align:start position:0%
phone yeah so can Consolidated is a
traditional

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
um eye lack of traditional phone company
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
so we operate a copper network with with
 
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:38.459 align:start position:0%
voice options we also have been
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
expanding at this point to over 274 000
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
residents in New Hampshire on a fiber
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
Network because fiber is the future sort
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
of as he outlined earlier the copper
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
Network's going away switch components
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
are difficult to obtain all of those
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
things so we build out with fiber with
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
that service we provide both the
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
internet connection and then a voice
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
over Internet Protocol of VoIP platform
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
which delivers voice
 
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.130 align:start position:0%
which delivers voice
foreign

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
offering on the Broadband is is less
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
expensive than the traditional copper
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
offerings because it can be delivered in
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
yeah this isn't a question specifically
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
for you but I just want to say that I'm
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the accuracy of
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
mapping cellular coverage I live in an
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
area where I can I barely get one bar
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm on a west facing slope I can see
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
Killington from my house and I'm lucky
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
to get one bar sure I go half a mile
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
from my house on a road that's in a
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
little Hollow it's a dead zone and also
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
just the the coverage can change from
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
from day to day or season to season so
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
there might be a place that has coverage
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
in the winter but not in the summer
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
so yeah I just get really concerned
 
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.210 align:start position:0%
so yeah I just get really concerned
about

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
if someone is going to be in a place
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about no wire line
 
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.410 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about no wire line
access

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
and we say well you know you do have one
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
bar of cell coverage today that doesn't
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
mean that they're going to have coverage
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well two things
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
um certainly the the the wire line is
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent maybe a wireless
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
service isn't working but a wire line is
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
then that can connect via home Wi-Fi so
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
that is sort of a a secondary
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I personally can't get cell phone I
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
live in Maine I can't get cell phone
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
coverage at my house but I like the
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
carrier I'm with and so I I rely on my
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
internet to some extent
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
um that's that's sort of one Fail-Safe
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
but the the other thing is there's
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
always the ability of satellite phones
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different others and
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
when we worked this bill in Maine which
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
was in 2012 that you know the the goal
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
was to find a balance between you know
 
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
making sure that people were largely
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
covered and that there would be some
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
contingent and there was this
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
availability of of sort of Alternatives
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
a satellite phone works
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the kangamangus highway is the only
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
place I've ever been that I've seen that
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
one doesn't work the the thing about
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
satellite though is that um again that's
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
weather dependent right you know think
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
about people who have satellite dishes
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
and it's snowing and you know they they
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't really have great service
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I think you're you might be confusing
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
um sort of a like HughesNet type
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
satellite delivered internet service
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
versus like a true satellite phone that
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
people use when they go deep into the
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
woods and other things my understanding
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
is the technology that deploys that is
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually very reliable like I said
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
um there you you can get lost in the
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
absolute middle of nowhere with Mount
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
Washington in the way but that is is
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
very rare
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
can you can you talk about
 
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.550 align:start position:0%
can you can you talk about
um

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
you know where realistically
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
you I know you're only one carrier but
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
where realistically you would be you
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
know petitioning for a relief of this
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
this obligation and
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so so there's two can two two
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
things outlined in the bill
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
um with respect to that so first is that
 
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:19.700 align:start position:0%
there is sufficient competition right
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
utility Monopoly utility regulation is
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
under a theory that you're a monopoly
 
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
right you are the only electric provider
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
and therefore we need to check your
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
rates check all these things because
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
there isn't a market dealing with that
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
so the first the first aspect of it is
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
there is a market there are cable
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
competitors that we're going
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
head-to-head with that don't have this
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
additional burden on them that frankly
 
00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019 align:start position:0%
is unfunded by us and so it it's really
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
to allow us to compete to me that's
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua that's Manchester that's Concord
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
I mean the numbers have to be pulled and
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
verified but but those are the type of
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
places that we're talking with respect
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
to that the second area is where
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
um very clearly the state has chosen to
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
invest in another provider to provide
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
service to the entire town so this State
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
gave New Hampshire Electric Co-op 50
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars to build out to all of
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Plymouth already has a cable
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
provider for 95 plus percent of it now
 
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a fiber provider
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
that the state is funding fully funding
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
to build over it it probably doesn't
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
make sense for Consolidated to come in
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
and invest and be a third provider there
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's not a good use of our money
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
probably we're probably better served to
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
upgrade our Network in other areas where
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
they could use it more so those are the
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
two two ideas one is very clearly there
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
is a lot of competition the second is
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
the state very state or Municipal but
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't have a lot of this
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
money to do this have clearly invested
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
in somebody else to cover the entirety
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
of that area so those those are the two
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
concepts so you know one is the very the
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
Manchester's conquerors the other is is
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
areas such as Plymouth is sort of the
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
big one
 
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.949 align:start position:0%
big one
um

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
um so did you did I hear you say that
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
you worked on a similar Bill the the
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
main bill yeah I I actually drafted and
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
negotiated at the time this bill in
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
Maine okay so I have some specific
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions about about this this bill and
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I mean there's
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
30 days 30 days 30 days 60 days 14 days
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
180 days six months have you have you or
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
Chris not not um not I beg your pardon
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
not Chris but uh representative months
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
have you worked out a timeline for this
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so I got this bill last night and I
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
did take a look at it um and and if you
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't mind I I would like to make a few
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
comments if that's okay yeah of course
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
not exactly well I mean it's not up to
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
me go ahead is that okay is it okay with
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief and succinct so not try
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
not to bore you to tears
 
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.449 align:start position:0%
not to bore you to tears
um

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
and if I if anything's changed from when
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
I saw it it's inadvertent and I
 
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.850 align:start position:0%
I saw it it's inadvertent and I
apologize

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
um but so a couple of things
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
um sort of a a technical thing with
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
respect to this is that it talks about
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
provider of Last Resort service that is
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
a concept defined in Statute in Maine
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
that does not exist here I think we
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
would want to talk about basic service
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
here that's just technical right just
 
00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:29.899 align:start position:0%
clean up but I note that at the outset
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
in Maine when we when we did this they
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
were we listed out the municipalities
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
and those were deemed deregulated
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and then the purpose of the hearing
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
in each municipality which is outlined
 
00:16:46.449 --> 00:16:46.459 align:start position:0%
here was really just to let people know
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
that this is happening and and give them
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask questions and
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
speak with the office of the public
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
Advocate which is similar to your
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate game as well as the
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
puc which is similar to your doe here
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
came and sort of were there to answer
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
people's questions and sort of provide
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
information it wasn't
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
um there was already a finding this was
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
already happening and that meeting was
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
just to let everybody know what's
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
happening the way it's set out in this
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
bill it's like there's a preliminary
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
finding and then it's sort of a little
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
bit unclear about what happens in
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
between or you know and and I caution
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
you against doing it that way only
 
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.189 align:start position:0%
you against doing it that way only
because

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
when speaking at that meeting the DOE
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
and ourselves frankly can't represent
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
this is happening because there isn't a
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
final finding and it it just sort of
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
muddies the water I would also say and I
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to reach out to Maine
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
they will confirm this it might even be
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
confirmed in their their reports they
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
did two reports on the legislation they
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
were required to follow up as to how it
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
was going some meetings no one attended
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
I think are most heavily attended
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
meeting had maybe 10 people
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
um I just I just cautioned you they were
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
not particularly useful
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
um we we provided notice in the
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
newspaper we provided notice in our
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
bills and people just are not big on
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
attending meetings and particularly on
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
this issue so you know we're not we're
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily terribly against that
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
but it's I'm not sure it was the most
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
valuable I certainly think providing
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
notice via the bills and providing
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
information to customers is important
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure the public meeting so
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
I have to offer that so should this bill
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
also require the our consumer Advocate
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
to to attend these meetings I don't see
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
I I think that's fine I mean I think
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing I think the doe does
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
a very good job representing consumers
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
in the concerns of consumers so it's not
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily necessary the only slight
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
difference is here in New Hampshire the
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate doesn't really have a
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
role in Telecom regulation as I
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
understand that and I would encourage
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
you Amanda is way more knows a little
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
more about that I would encourage you to
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
to confirm that with her but that's as I
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
understand it they don't really have a
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
role in Telecom regulation since your
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
deregulation bill so it's that would be
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
one reason that maybe it might not make
 
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.490 align:start position:0%
one reason that maybe it might not make
sense

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
I've got more questions I don't want to
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
monopolize but um just I'll throw this
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
one out quickly
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
um so there was you know the
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
notification it must be in a newspaper
 
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:20.660 align:start position:0%
newspapers are so quaint these days
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns don't have them how are
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
they in Maine are they requiring social
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
media anything like that at the time
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
that was all that was required um at the
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
time when was when was this 2012 2012
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean and they were they were
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
going that way too I'm I'm not sure how
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
effective that was I think I think
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
definitely customer notices and bills I
 
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.130 align:start position:0%
definitely customer notices and bills I
think

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
um you know we would have no issue with
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
websites and social media I think
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
lifeline and that affordable
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
connectivity program I think we've
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
proven through all that we don't have a
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
great way of reaching anybody I mean we
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
try all these platforms and then still
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
people don't subscribe so
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I think we've gotten dispersed and
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
we've got our media so much different
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
now that there isn't a terrific way what
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
about a certified letter U.S mail
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
I mean that would be fine too we did
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
them as as just either Bill messages or
 
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
inserts in the belt but okay similar
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
I guess you know I I
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
you know as I said this was just random
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
thinking on my charts no absolutely
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
nothing's locked in stone here I guess
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
my thinking on the on creating kind of
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
like the preliminary approval and then
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
the meeting with the final approval was
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
that it would just it just provides kind
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
of a um an opportunity that you know if
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
something is missed
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
so if there's you know a pocket of
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
people that's that that
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
somehow get missed in the mapping that
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
would lose service would not have any
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
alternatives it's an opportunity for
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
those people to come forward
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
and present that information to the doe
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
before they made a final decision and
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
then theoretically that if that was a if
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
that was confirmed and the doe felt that
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was important enough
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
they could decide not to give the not
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
the issue the order that's kind of where
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
I was going with that now
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying about people
 
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.220 align:start position:0%
not coming to meetings I mean I get that
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah and and I think in the
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
confines of current doe process
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that's publicized you
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
can get that because not only can they
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
come when they're if there was written
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
into the process of a hearing at the at
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
the commission they also typically can
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
file comments I think you can do that
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so that they have an alternative
 
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
means they can't necessarily get
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
conquered or I can't make the meeting
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
but I can file comments and the
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
commission takes that or the DOA I'm
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
sorry I will get there one day the doe
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
will take that into consideration
 
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
will take that into consideration
yeah

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
did you have any in Maine where's did
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
you did you run into people that that
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
literally you know by when they lost
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
their their landline service that they
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
had no other options
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
um nobody truly lost their landline
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.549 align:start position:0%
um nobody truly lost their landline
service

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
um we have not proceeded with line
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
extensions we have not with a line
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
extension I should explain means like
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
somebody built a new development and
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't build into there things
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
um the the concerns you hear repeatedly
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
um are with respect to
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
there there is an age of people that a
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
landline is a landline is a landline is
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
a landline and that's just all there is
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
to it so there is that contingent of
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
people and you do hear that and you tell
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
them there's multiple other options and
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
they only know a landline they'll only
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
ever trust the landline
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and to some extent that's just just
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
needs you know sort of a change this is
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
a secure technology it's fine it can
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
offer all the things you need it just
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
takes education but the biggest concerns
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
tend to be around devices you know the
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
life alerts that people worry that their
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
security alarms won't work and so there
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
was a lot of Education in Maine we had
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
people come in and speak about how these
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are alternatives and these devices
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
can work off other Technologies because
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
I think people just you know again a
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
tried and true landline they just
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
believe that is the way
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and if everybody felt that way and
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
everybody were using it we wouldn't be
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
here today the problem is that is is a
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
very a small population and keeping all
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
those wires going for for what is of in
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
some areas where there's plenty of
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
competition of very few people is where
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
the problem starts to come in right
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that's trying to be
 
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.690 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that's trying to be
solved

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
solved
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
a quick question for you I'm sorry
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
um have you had problems have you had
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
problem with municipalities as far as I
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
know one of the towns that represent
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
Southampton I believe Consolidated cable
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
offers service to them but they there's
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
no cell service in the entire town
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
because they refuse any cell towers
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the area have you had any
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
issues with any municipalities that you
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
know of that have had run-ins with that
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
I have not I have never heard of a town
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
that would be the first one that has no
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
um cell service
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities frequently have
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances against small cells which are
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
are small wireless devices placed on
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
polls they're sort of a new movement to
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
stop with that but I've I've never heard
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
of because Towers
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
depending on geography it can be pretty
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
far away and serve the town so I have
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
not heard that but in that instance that
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
town would not qualify under here that's
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
sort of the balance we're trying to
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
achieve is like people have Alternatives
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
um because as as we see nearly everybody
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
has switched to a cellular device that's
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
where most of the 911 traffic is coming
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
from you know
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I have a question on that sure
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
I represent 20 unincorporated towns up
 
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.310 align:start position:0%
I represent 20 unincorporated towns up
north

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
north
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
and I think we've talked about that
 
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.090 align:start position:0%
and I think we've talked about that
before

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.190 align:start position:0%
before
yes

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
and until in this bill you know if with
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
those with those uh 28 Incorporated
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
places yeah so um
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
most likely I don't think they would
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
qualify the only way they under the
 
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.020 align:start position:0%
statute that I truly believe
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
unincorporated Place qualifies is if the
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
state paid another provider to build to
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
all of that town and then in that
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
instance they have a state funded
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
alternative to us that is supposed to
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
build to everywhere so I feel like those
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
people would have an alternative would
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
not be left out in the cold they may not
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
have cell service but they have this
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
fiber provider that the state has paid
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
to bring to each person the uh this is
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
not aimed at unincorporated a really
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
rural areas those are those don't tend
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of competition those are
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
like we're still working to get them
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
their first broadband connection not
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
their third
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
right now we're paying our sheriffs can
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
you you just came back on you were going
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
for two years off the delegation but we
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
have them going around going into these
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
areas because people have been moving up
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
there in droves in these places so we're
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
basically having a sheriff is going in
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
for safety reasons to find out who's
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
where and where right there's been over
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
400 different it's crazy what's going on
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
up there so that's something that that's
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
why I was just asking that question yeah
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
no and and that's that's not unique we
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
have a ton of unincorporated places in
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
Maine too I'm very familiar with that
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
but but those are not again unless they
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
they're paying somebody to do that those
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
are not the places that are going to
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
qualify for this and not really the
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
places that this is aimed at it's it's
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
aimed at truly competitive areas with
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
lots of alternatives
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
would it be better would it be better if
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
we just structured the bill around and
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
specifically defined areas like in Maine
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
I know you they identified specific
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
towns I mean in you clearly have you you
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
know where you want to focus I mean
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
would it be better to just identify with
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
those towns and say this bill only
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
applies to that
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I think I think for the first part
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think the second part
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
um is is clearly defined as well so I
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
don't think you divine towns with that
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
but defining the fact that the state is
 
00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.020 align:start position:0%
paying somebody to serve the entire town
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then not forcing another provider to
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
overbuild over that
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
public investment is really important
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
too so I think you could Define the
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
towns in the first section which sort of
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
takes away the ambiguity or concerns on
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
am I going to qualify based on the map
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
and then the second section which says
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
if the state pays you to build to every
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
person in the town you're covered as
 
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.409 align:start position:0%
person in the town you're covered as
well

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
and that either is or isn't right the
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
state either pays you to Bill to every
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
earlier you you mentioned that it took a
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
lot of Education to get people away from
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
landlines and things like that who was
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for that was it the
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
providers the municipalities doe all of
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
the above
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
um so in each of these towns
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we put together
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
um fact sheets I think the the puc
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
mostly put them together they took our
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
input they took input of the public
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
Advocates on those fact sheets and those
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
were put out in the towns they worked
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
with us we had to sort of get our
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
messaging to a customers approved by
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
them so they were comfortable with that
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
we were explaining at least as much as
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
you can and sort of messaging
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and then then on both the puc site
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the public Advocate site they had
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
links to sort of here's where you can
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
find who the alternative providers are
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
they produce a guide called a Weight
 
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
Watcher guide that has the prices of
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
alternative providers so it was mostly
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
done through the the state government
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and and not to put a burden on the state
 
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.769 align:start position:0%
and and not to put a burden on the state
government

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
but they are better equipped to
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
adequately represent our competition
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
than we are that's why like it's the
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
burden on us isn't it's not that it's a
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
big deal it's just you know us talking
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
about the rights of our competitors is
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
sort of a weird thing right
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
so were these fact sheets mailed out to
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
customers um they were presented at the
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
public hearings and they were made
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
available online I don't believe they
 
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
so as you probably noticed I hadn't
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
thought about satellite phone right
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
before right I was thinking of satellite
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
internet that's right uh so one question
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
that just came up in my mind was all
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
right if I have a SAT phone and I call
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 what happens and I just Googled it
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
and you do get 9-1-1 service on a SAT
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
phone for your country but I don't know
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
what happens after that I don't know how
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
they routed to the right local people do
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
you do you know anything about that I I
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't not sitting right here I would be
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
largely guessing I'm sure it
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
triangulates similar to a cell phone but
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's not being my business I would
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
yeah uh going back to representative
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
munz's question about focusing on a
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
local municipality yeah a lot of the
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities are still growing out
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
right if you were asked to provide
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
service as the town is growing out you
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
would not be providing copper service
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
you would be providing Fiber service
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
that's right as a preference that's
 
00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:40.190 align:start position:0%
that's right as a preference that's
right

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's right anything new we build we
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
would build this fiber I mean you want
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
to create a future-proof technology
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's offering best-in-class service
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
um you know the copper network was great
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
for for what it was but it's not meeting
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
the needs of consumers who want to
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
stream all their content want to do all
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
the things they're doing today yeah
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay good you know we were Heroes when
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
we introduced TSL now you know people
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
look at you and discuss it after
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.220 align:start position:0%
so you're you're you're
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
obviously one of the the largest
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
carriers if not the largest would be
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
affected by this they're the largest and
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask you to speak for
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
the for the others but do you have any
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
sense what their reaction would be to
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
saying picking specific
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
um towns and locations uh so I I I think
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the first run and we did this in
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
Maine I think and Teresa's Teresa's here
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
and she represents the small companies
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
um but I sit on a board with them so I
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
generally understand I think that they
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
um would not want to be their areas at
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
the outset probably would not want to be
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
included in a list of areas that were
 
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.149 align:start position:0%
included in a list of areas that were
were

00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
um put forth in this bill they may
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
subsequently change their mind on that
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
but they get some Universal service
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
support mechanisms from the Feds that
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
are different than what we get because
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
they're small carriers that I think they
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be concerned might be impacted by
 
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.630 align:start position:0%
would be concerned might be impacted by
that

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
if thinking thinking back to the
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
carriers Last Resort idea yeah if if we
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
move away from the carrier of Last
 
00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:17.389 align:start position:0%
move away from the carrier of Last
Resort

00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
Resort
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
in this case then effectively it goes
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:27.980 align:start position:0%
who else is who else is required is
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
obligated by a carrier Last Resort
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
obligation yeah there there is no
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
obligation for any other provider than
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
the incumbent providers in the state
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the exception of
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
um carriers that have taken rural
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
digital opportunity fund money they have
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
some voice obligations but those are in
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
sort of census blocks the census block
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
groups really in discrete areas so in in
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
large part there is no there is no other
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
carrier I mean that's that's that's
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is like we we have
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
to take on a burden that nobody else
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
does it made sense when we were the only
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
game in town now we're trying to compete
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
head to head with people who don't have
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
they can make decisions basically on
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
deployment based on you know what's best
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the business not on
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
125 year old obligation
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
along the same line of plot what happens
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
to the local telcos though who are still
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
operating on a copper basis
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
um are they are they forced to move to
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
fiber in their territories I think most
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the small local telcos that are not
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
Consolidated have a fair amount of fiber
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think most of them are are operating
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
on a lot of fiber today that's my
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
understanding I don't know them all 100
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that's what's going
 
00:33:54.419 --> 00:33:55.490 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that's what's going
on

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
um just a informational question so no
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
one is doing copper anymore right
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
no well copper still exists copper is
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
providing service but no I can't imagine
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
a company would make a proactive
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
decision to build that copper over fiber
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's the same cost
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
um on and you're again you're losing a
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
lot of functionality is it the same cost
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
yeah so so actually in some aspects
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
copper can be a little more expensive
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
because copper is valuable sure but yeah
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
like in a green field situation so
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
nothing exists if we were to if
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
Consolidated were to build out today it
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
would 100 do fiber because it's it's the
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
same or even less cost in most
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
situations the reason copper is still in
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
play is because it exists it's the
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
infrastructure yeah exactly
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
so can I can I come back to me my last
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
question so if we said if we said for
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
example that you know that this only
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
applies to Manchester Nashua Keen
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth you know whatever
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then also to the areas where the
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
state or the feds have provided you know
 
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.230 align:start position:0%
state or the feds have provided you know
funding

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
that would presumably benefit you
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
but what about the small Telecom company
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's providing services in town X
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
um they would no longer they wouldn't
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
have the ability to be to petition for
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
relief from the obligation right that's
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
right that's right and that that could
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
be a detriment yeah absolutely I can't
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe that they'd be terribly excited
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
about that right and it could be a
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
detriment to us as as well because there
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
may be other areas that subsequently
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
become incredibly competitive so it's
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's maybe not ideal but as a first step
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
that makes sense or if you look at Maine
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
they sort of did you know first step
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
these municipalities and then you can
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
petition subsequently and they did a
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
rule making instead of a process for
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:59.050 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
Teresa Rosenberger Bernstein sure I
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire telephone
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
Association which is Consolidated as
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
well as TDS Bretton Woods Dunbarton and
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
Granite State telephones so I have all
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
what the I call the Ma Bell Legacy
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
incumbent local exchange carriers what
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
the association likes about this bill is
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
the flexibility
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
and certainly if you decide to go and
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
put towns in I will speak to each member
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
before you do a final to see if they
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
wanted some towns towns included but the
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
way the bill was originally drafted was
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
to give flexibility so they could choose
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted to keep Universal
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
service or they wanted to give it up and
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
and go forward and so I don't know I I
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
know where they are right now I don't
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
know where they'll be in two years and
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why we drafted it with the
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the flexibility but I certainly
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
will go ask them if you decide to go and
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
do specific tips
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm just clarifying when you say that
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're supporting this bill do you mean
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment that is in front of us or
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
that well they have the original bill
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
they have not seen the amendment because
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
like Sarah I got it last night okay and
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
also household 2 came out last night
 
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.510 align:start position:0%
also household 2 came out last night
which

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I was up late reading and haven't
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
finished the whole thing yet yeah yeah
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and started at nine this morning
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
with Casa downstairs so yeah uh I'm
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
gonna send it to them as soon as I um as
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
I get back okay and but I thought since
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
I saw it late not late but last night
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
that I'd hear the conversation and since
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
you've got a couple of days to get back
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
to them and say this is kind of where
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking and what do you
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
think yeah so no um representative munz
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um shared the original main bill with me
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
which does list the towns and and
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that too restrictive I
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
mean might there be a town that's not
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
listed that accidentally becomes
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
that should be on the list or something
 
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
well I think that that is problematic
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
because you may have a town that becomes
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
covered and would qualify that's
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
actually pretty expensive to maintain
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
versus another town that's on the list
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
that might not be as expensive to
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
maintain and I think the point is you
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
want to use your resources most wisely
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
because even though there's been what 90
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars given out for broadband
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
that still isn't covering the whole
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
state yeah and so you know we look at
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
when I ran fear point my goal was to
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
have the North Country I wouldn't talk
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
to Ray Burton have the North country
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
that last line uh that last mile served
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
and I failed or shall I say we all fail
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
but uh but I think it gives the company
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
a little more flexibility to say okay
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
there may be one of your unincorporated
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
places that really does need it so it
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
might make more sense to go petition for
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
this town versus that town but this
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
town's not under so it sounds like
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're advocating that we add
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
towns no I'm just advocating for
 
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:21.980 align:start position:0%
flexibility because I I think the the
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
Landscapes changing so much so that I
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
just what we may say today might not be
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah well that's what I'm that's
 
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.609 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah well that's what I'm that's
right

00:39:30.609 --> 00:39:30.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
my clients and I would advocate for
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
flexibility okay thank you
 
00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.170 align:start position:0%
flexibility okay thank you
the

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure that I necessarily
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
believe that we should add towns I mean
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
I think the the the the the the
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
I guess the rationale for doing it is it
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe limits it gives some comfort to it
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
gives people comfort that there aren't
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot there aren't going to
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
be this group of people that are going
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
to be without service because those
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
large towns we know in those large areas
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
they've got alternatives
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's
um

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know and and we just can go into
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
this feeling comfortable that there
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be you know somebody
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
stuck in a valley somewhere or Tom on
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
his Mountain that uh doesn't have
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
service so should we identify areas by
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
population or is that not you know if
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's if it's under a certain I don't
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what that does either
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah okay just a thought I I would think
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
the network would be the best place to
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
look it's how you've distributed it what
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
are your outlying points where you you
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
kind of set limits that you're not going
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
to exceed anymore and you're going to
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
bring fiber in I would think that would
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
be kind of the way you'd want to look at
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
it that's that's probably what should be
 
00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:43.310 align:start position:0%
it that's that's probably what should be
mad

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
mad
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah the the problem with that is that
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
um you know it's not like there's copper
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
to hear and we want to bring fiber out
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's that the copper infrastructure is
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
aging the switching equipment is having
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
component part issues so we're
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
overlaying the network over it right so
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's like of course you know in conquer
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
is a great example we offer copper
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
service that that's up and running we've
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
built I think we're working on a
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Crossing but other than that
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
built the entire city uh with fiber
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
um an alternative service so you know
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not like the end of the
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
line and then we're going out from there
 
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's we're really rebuilding the network
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
with the technology that's meeting the
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have uh just curiosity because
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the fiber overlay do you all have
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
mapping of where there's currently fiber
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
whether it's projected fiber in the near
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
future and weather is not fiber right
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
now to be projected so we do we do
 
00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:47.339 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
the the second part the the where it
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
exists today is relatively easy the
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
second part is where we get concerned uh
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
people ask us about that and and as a
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
company our plants change so we may have
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
something that we've been prepared to
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
build fiber and a competitor comes in
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
and builds it so we invest elsewhere or
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know we get out and we engineer it
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
and it's actually a little more
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
expensive than we planned so we don't go
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
as far into the town so we are very
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
hesitant to provide future future plans
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
because one we're telling our
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
competitors exactly where we're going
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
that creates an issue and two things can
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
change and then consumers are
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
disappointed so we we try to keep that
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
within the budget year
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
um as far as indicating where we're
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
actually going because if it's in a
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
budget year it definitely is going to
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
happen it's been budgeted if it's false
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
outside that it starts to get tricky
 
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.170 align:start position:0%
outside that it starts to get tricky
right

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the map that the state is
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
building is
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to be very similar if not
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
identical to the map that is already in
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
existence through the FCC that's sort of
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding so we had to file
 
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
yesterday so the only thing I will say
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
and and this is sort of minor and you're
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
always going to deal with this is that
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's always going to by its nature be
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
six months behind right because you have
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
to pick a point in time and you have to
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
map that and that takes some some effort
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
and so it's always sort of six months
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
behind so we're filing you know now for
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
um you know previous stuff I think
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
through September 30 or something like
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that so it's always going to be a little
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
bit behind but you know six months is
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
not is not a killer here so I'm not
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
worried about the sort of it's lagging
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
and something's changed issue
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we'd all feel better
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
if we saw we saw the math but I presume
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
it to be very similar I am unaware of
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
work they're doing that will make it
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
much different from what the FCC is
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
doing I I've heard some concerns that
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
the map just isn't it that you know it
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
it leaves it leaves pockets of people
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
out yeah so a couple of things
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
um no no mapping is that is completely
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
accurate and if if you get to have the
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
joy that we get to do
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
um which is figuring out addresses and
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
what their geo coordinates are and
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
exactly what you know who's right like
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
if you go on Google Google or sometimes
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
you see it puts your house over here
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
your house is really over here right
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's just some inaccuracy
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
um that just is going to exist that you
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
can't get past
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
um you know I was talking to the woman
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
from MMA and she was concerned because
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
her address didn't show up well she in
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
subsequent conversations doesn't have
 
00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:29.339 align:start position:0%
any lines to our house there is no 9-1-1
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
service currently at her house the the
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
underlying data is a 911 database so if
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
you can't today call 9-1-1 there's
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
nothing mapped out about calling 911 in
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
the future because you never had a line
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
a line built to your house for that and
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
you know that that is going to be that
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
is not going to get fixed in New
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like I it could get fixed in
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am curious to how what
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
database they would use to find places
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
that are off the grid for all intents
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
and purposes I don't know how they would
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and I haven't heard a good answer to
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
how they're going to find those places
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I've heard some states use
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
crowdsourcing you know I exist I'm here
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's had some success um
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
limited again people people don't spend
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of time figuring out how to fix a
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
map unless they're really invested but
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
oh most most normal humans proceed on
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
without doing that so unfortunately
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
you're always going to deal with some
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
some amount of inaccuracy because it's
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
always based on the database and the
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
database is always going to be
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
to some extent not perfect
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned this before that that the
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
time line of this bill of this amendment
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment um which you know it
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
I I think it's pretty solid but um if
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
you add up all of the times it looks
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
like you it takes almost 12 months to go
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
from start to finish and that's
 
00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.349 align:start position:0%
from start to finish and that's
acceptable

00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think the biggest hold on that
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't that really wasn't the intent the
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
intent was that it would be 180 days
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah from from from the start of the
 
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
petition to when the order the final
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
order gets
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be 180 days from
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
the petition to the order and then I
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
guess the way I worded it there would be
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
a kind of a six-month transition period
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
where people would have the chance then
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
to pick another service I mean yeah
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it is maybe when you add
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
everything up and so it's 180 days but
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
but they're allowed to extend like an
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
additional third it's a year like I said
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
um I added them up
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
would we like everything to be shorter
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
yes would we like it to be easier yes is
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
six months an unreasonably long time in
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
a doe process no
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we whenever we get a time
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
crunch list less than six months I feel
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
like we're all always unhappy we just
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
finished a case
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
um that had a similar thing and I think
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
everyone would have wished at the end of
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
the day there was more time well so so
 
00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:02.329 align:start position:0%
the day there was more time well so so
likewise

00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
um if the process goes longer than these
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
these guidelines are there independent
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
penalties involved I mean well as I read
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
it and this is not uncommon it has a
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
outer limit the the doe shall issue in
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
order in six months
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's a hard date for
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
them I think they have to meet that yeah
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's not uncommon in this industry
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
tariff approvals follow timelines that
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
have card dates
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
um if both parties want to change that
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's you know you can pull it and
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
refile I mean there's ways you can if
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
both parties agree but I think that's a
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
good sort of normal hard date so that
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't concern me and then the other
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
part is really on us you have to keep
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
the service going for six months to give
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
them a chance to get off I don't think
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
there would be a penalty for taking
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
longer I think you guys would be excited
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
if we even left it in a little longer
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
right like is that is that reasonable or
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
can it be could it be shorter I it could
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
be shorter I think I think six months
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
for customers is good
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
um you know that to me
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
is is you know we've been doing this 125
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
years six more months
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
now now maybe you know within the
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
process if something you know the
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
hurricane comes in yeah we would
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
probably petition for an exception that
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
says we're not going to go put back up
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
the copper for a month and a half
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um that all fell down but that's sort of
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
an extreme case you know and I I feel
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
like the doe would see some
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
reasonableness in that
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
I have another question
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm not sorry actually I've got I
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
want to understand this so the the final
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
line doe shall Provide support and if
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
available funding to assist in that
 
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.690 align:start position:0%
available funding to assist in that
effort

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
um and it says shall
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I have it wasn't really mine to
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
have concerns because it's not me
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
um but I I did think that was sort of
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
probably maybe something that isn't
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
necessary in a competitive area there's
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so I don't know what they
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
would fund well that's that's where's
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
the funding coming from yeah yeah yeah
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
yeah and and that again was just you
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
know a weak attempt to try to you know
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
say that you know if people are going to
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
be at an economic disadvantage because
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
of this that they're we're going to do
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
everything we can to try to help them
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
out and I didn't know you know I didn't
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
know if the doe had any programs that
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
would assist with this I mean that's
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
really all I'm trying to do there I'm
 
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:32.099 align:start position:0%
not trying to
 
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:32.809 align:start position:0%
not trying to
um

00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's the bleeding heart liberal
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
in me so maybe it should be May instead
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
of shallow or something I mean there's
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
all these legal things but or explore
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean yeah we could certainly
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
play around with the word but yeah it
 
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
was just a way to just say you know if
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
if somebody is going to lose their if
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
they're paying ten dollars a month and
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's all they can afford and all of a
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
sudden they're gonna have to pay 50 a
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
month hey right we're gonna do
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
everything we can to try to help them no
 
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of this is is
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
terrific I just think we need to to
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
punch punch it enough so that we see
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
what's behind it yeah so I was just
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
looking up you know again sat phones
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
um you know what what do they cost and
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can actually get an iridium plan
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
for as little as 65 a month
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
but that's for 10 minutes yeah which if
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
you're making a 9-1-1 call probably
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
yeah it that's an extreme that is a like
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of nowhere you
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
can't get anything else most people
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
probably have a cell phone or a um Cable
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
phone that works
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
are they still those big monsters that's
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
it is it's not the low Earth orbiting
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.359 --> 00:51:18.829 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for allowing
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Catherine heck and
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
Association and the 234 cities and towns
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
we had originally come to oppose this
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
legislation as we had some real concerns
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
about our underserved and unserved or
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
our last Mile and Middle mile Broadband
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
um members are cities and towns who
 
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020 align:start position:0%
might appear to be served on FCC mapping
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
however we know that their residents in
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
fact do not have access to things like
 
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.770 align:start position:0%
fact do not have access to things like
Wireless

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:56.780 align:start position:0%
Wireless
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
reliable Wireless at home or Broadband
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge that other states have
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
and are doing this the relief of carrier
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
Last Resort so we're not
 
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.250 align:start position:0%
Last Resort so we're not
um

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with that this process is
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
taking place and new technologies are
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
coming forward and that's important we
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
we do continue to have many concerns
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
however and I heard some of the
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
discussions so perhaps I'll just start
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
touching on maybe the mapping the
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
granite mapping team that's being Head
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
Up by UNH but by your former Broadband
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
director here from the state Carol
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
Monroe so she has extensive knowledge in
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
broadband and it is in fact showing
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
high-speed access for both broadband and
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
wireless so just that was brought up
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether Wireless was included and that
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
is part of the plan so more than 30
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
providers for wireless and Broadband
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
will be providing data in addition to
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
several other ways that they can ping
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
individual locations to see if there's
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
access I'm not an expert in how they're
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
doing that I don't understand how the
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
Goblins in the sky necessarily work or
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
the elves but I will say that we have
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
been assured that this map will fact the
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
reason that they've spent the money to
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
contract for this map is so that we have
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
a more accurate understanding of our
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
middle and last mile underserved as I
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
was sitting in a public meeting I I I'm
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to tell you who I
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
can quote on this but it was a member of
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
a committee that said even in downtown
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
Concord there is only two bars sometimes
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
for wireless so and we're in downtown
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
Concord so the concern is that
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
without the accurate mapping and as
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to build out as you
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
just heard 50 million dollars was
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
awarded to the co-op a non-profit and on
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
February 22nd Consolidated
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
um CCI was awarded 40 million dollars to
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
do additional build out by governor and
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
Council from the American Rescue plan
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
act Capital project fund so we're moving
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the right direction getting this
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
build out getting our members served and
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
all the residents and businesses I we're
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
just not there yet last night I had the
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to the Southwest
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission so that
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
served the Southwest bottom part of the
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
state out by where I live the
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
Peterborough area over to Keem and they
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
have some real concerns with this bill
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
as middle and last mile Broadband is
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
still a huge obstacle for digital equity
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
in that area of the state some towns
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
have done the public-private partnership
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
like my own to do that 100 build out
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
there were federal funds involved with
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and we do have 100 percent
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
in my community but in my school
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
district district for example during
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
covid we spent more than a hundred
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars getting hot spots for
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
other areas of communities where people
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
had absolutely no way to do homeschool
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
um so that was really challenging and
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
some children had to go to the public
 
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
library because a hot spot wouldn't even
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
work in their location so we're still
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with these challenges from our
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs and fire and EMS Personnel
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
five percent of any population is too
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
many to be without an available 9-1-1
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I did hear about the education that
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
has to happen that again we agree the
 
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:17.220 align:start position:0%
technology does allow for all of the
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
same uses but we have members of our
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
population who like their landline they
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
believe in that and we don't want
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities having to take over that
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
educational role of trying to help them
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
navigate how in fact they're going to be
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
able to get these services
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
we feel like that's not quite our our
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
role although we do serve our members in
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
our residence and we do need them to
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
know that they will have 9-1-1 access if
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
they're in a a zone that otherwise isn't
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
available and then of course
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility continue
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
to be a concern as we know HughesNet is
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
very expensive if that's your
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
alternative a cell phone is much more
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
expensive than a landline so again
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
affordability for that potential three
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
to five percent of the population is a
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
concern for us as our local governments
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes have to take over helping make
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
those payments to individuals so that
 
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
they can have access and that is of
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
course a strain on local government and
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
we would like to avoid that if at all
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
possible so while we also got a copy of
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment last evening and thank you
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
very much for sharing that we feel like
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is moving in a better Direction by
 
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:29.900 align:start position:0%
using a mapping technology
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
that we know will be as accurate as
 
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.150 align:start position:0%
that we know will be as accurate as
possible

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
but we still continue to be concerned
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the 95 percent in the middle and
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
last Mile and if that in fact
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
how many people will that impact and by
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
having towns named or cities I think
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
that would do the reassurances and while
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
I can appreciate
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the opposite side wanting the
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
flexibility we want the assurances that
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
this does not affect unincorporated
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
places or that corner of Keene because
 
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
of course telecommunications is done by
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
region not by Municipal borders so
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be times when things
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
might not be you know you live on the
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
outskirts of your town but maybe you're
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
served really by
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
the town next door because again I don't
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
think that they and they can speak
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
better to this but they don't have
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
Geographic borders like municipalities
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
do there's not hard borders there and I
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
do know from the Southwest Regional
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission they said they have
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
a hundred people living in a square mile
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
over on that side of the state so of
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
course without density there's not a lot
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
of incentive for build out so as we wait
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
for either federal or state Partnerships
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
or federal funds and the public-private
 
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.549 align:start position:0%
or federal funds and the public-private
Partnerships

00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
Partnerships
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
we really do put people at risk and I
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
heard Keen mentioned and Keen has a
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
whole section of its of its City not
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
served so those are our concerns that by
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
defining a geographic border when we're
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
overlaying with
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
services that don't know Geographic
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
bounds our members are concerned so I
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
also would have to bring any Amendment
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
back and see how our members would feel
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
about it from emergency services to um
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know just in general to see what
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
their thoughts were and towns are
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
working very hard to get this Broadband
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
here I think it's coming and I'm not
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
saying that this is impossible and we
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
are willing to work on any possible
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
solution that we can come up with that
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
ensures residents and businesses have
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
the basic access to telephony we don't
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
create a larger divide and you know
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're shrinking the digital divide we're
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
not growing it prematurely
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions that
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
so thank thanks
 
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
so thank thanks
um

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
so it sounded like you might be amenable
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
to maybe as a first step just having to
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
build limited to specific
 
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.670 align:start position:0%
build limited to specific
towns

00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
well I think some of the lift that we
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
talked about between notifying people
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
Education and Training and assuring say
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
the Southwest part of the state or the
 
00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.299 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places that there's not
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
going to be you know some process that
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
comes in and I can appreciate that maybe
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
people did not attend public hearings in
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
another state I can't speak to whether
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
or not that would be popular or an
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
unpopular decision here but just
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we know the areas and
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
locations that this might impact and we
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
can make informed decisions and have a
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
plan for how that would how that will
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
play out because as I stated if you're
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
saying HughesNet is your service and
 
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:37.549 align:start position:0%
saying HughesNet is your service and
T-Mobile

00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
T-Mobile
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
well I'm standing there on my T-Mobile
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
phone isn't working so it says it's
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
working but it's not and HughesNet is
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
like can be up to 164 a month as opposed
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
to a landline so we want to make sure
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
that there's an aspect of affordability
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and not a huge financial burden
 
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
because five percent of the population
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the town could
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
potentially be a decent number of people
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
that are without an affordable reliable
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
option and again I think we're really
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
getting there with Consolidated now and
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
the on the co-op having 90 million
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
dollars and doing this build out we're
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
moving in this positive direction more
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
and more towns are creating
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
communication districts for example to
 
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
get that build out I think we are really
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're getting there but I think those
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
assurances are probably important to our
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
members to know who this would impact
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
and who it will not impact because
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
people are nervous about that
 
01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:33.950 align:start position:0%
people are nervous about that
um

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
I have to say that's that's their
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
reaction is does it affect my community
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
now because the map is showing we're 100
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
serve but these are my options where I
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
live you know
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the education did I
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
hear you correctly that the
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities want no part of it
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying they want no part of it
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
but I think that becomes an unfunded
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
mandate who in the municipality would do
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
the training how would that work how
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
would we what you know what experts do
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
we have at the municipal level to teach
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
people what their options are as far as
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know this change in the law we're
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
always very careful not to want to add
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
things to local government do we want to
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
partner of course if there's public
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
hearings if there's you know
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders of course Partnerships are
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
important but we don't want to be the
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
what becomes the middleman and many
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
times we would people are going to come
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
to our door saying have you seen this
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's happening to me and they're going
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
to come to the municipality for that
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
for guidance assistance that's who they
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
come to first so we want to make sure
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
that the education and training
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
materials that go out there are
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and it's not on the
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
municipality to help them find you know
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
individual Alternatives necessarily or
 
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
educate them um because we don't have an
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
expert to know that your security system
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
is hardwired into your phone line and
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to do XYZ with
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
broad you know some Fiber we don't have
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
anybody with that skill set necessarily
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
right in every town but you're not
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
averse to sharing educational material
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
in town and City websites correct apps
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
no we've never adversed the sharing
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
material just not having to be the uh
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
not to develop point of contact or to
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:24.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that individuals are reluctant to
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
give up their copper line service and
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
and that's the hurdle we somehow have to
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
get over to be able to allow them the
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
digital digital world to enter their
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
lives and education is a piece of that
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
but I I I'm struggling to see how how to
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
move move ahead in that mapping would
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
just identify locations but people are
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
still going to be reluctant to make the
 
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:52.970 align:start position:0%
still going to be reluctant to make the
change

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
well and that's something that no one
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
can mandate any individual to write to
 
01:02:59.809 --> 01:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
make that change and I do think there's
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
people with access to you know to Copper
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
that are choosing or for lack of you
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
know better understanding of what's
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
available to them they're not choosing
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
to move forward with digital and there's
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
some people that really don't have any
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
other access but to that their cell
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
phone up until two years ago my cell
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
phone did not work in my house
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
it did I had no cell service in my home
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
so what would my alternative be and I
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
had a satellite up until we got
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
Broadband um and that was 129 a month
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
plus tax and I had children so and
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's how I had television and Internet
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
up until we got Broadband so is that an
 
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.490 align:start position:0%
up until we got Broadband so is that an
affordable

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure I mean that's
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
up to each individual household so I
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
think there's a two-fold issue I think
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of its education and some of it's
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
making sure there's that access
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I live very remotely
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
um in a little tiny town in the
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
southwest part of the state outside of
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and there's many
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
communities like that and I think if
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
you're living in a bigger Community
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
you might not see that same
 
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.410 align:start position:0%
you might not see that same
um

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
the dirt road with the 300 foot driveway
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
off of you know the third dirt road I
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
mean those are the people that we're
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
concerned with that deserve the same
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and emergency service that every
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
other taxpayer pays for our main concern
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
is emergency service but of course if we
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
want housing if we want Business
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
Development if we want people to move to
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
our our communities when we need to have
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
more modern access and modern technology
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
and some of our communities are not
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
quite there yet
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
they're moving there though
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
we're getting there a
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
piece of this is is that we need to be
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
giving the department of edu energy some
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
some guidance as to how to think about
 
01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:45.619 align:start position:0%
and evaluate this issue because
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
effectively they're going to be making
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
the the practically they're going to be
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
making the decision for us in in the
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
future and uh it's it seems to me we
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
need to give them some guidance
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
and I think I believe there's a member
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy here and
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
they'd be best to speak to the agency
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
um they're certainly experts this is
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
their area and of course
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
we as you know Municipal Partners would
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
have no reason to believe that agency
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
would not make sure that every
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
Avenue has been explored and that
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
they're fully vetting any any change
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
that this might cause to municipalities
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
residents businesses to make sure it's
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of New Hampshire
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
citizens of course so how that piece of
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
the legislation works out I think you
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
I guess you know I hear everything
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I think they're all
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
very legitimate concerns
 
01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.349 align:start position:0%
very legitimate concerns
um

01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
in you know my I guess one of my
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
reactions to that as well maybe we just
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
need to wait we're not ready yet to move
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
in this Direction I mean is is that kind
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
of is that what you're saying or is it
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
or is there a way to just start
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
moving down the path that we need to be
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
moving down I think I think I would hope
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
that everybody agrees that it you know
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
we got to do something
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a challenging question
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
for me because I think we have two sides
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
to the coin here um we have where my
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
members who I represent my clients feel
 
01:06:17.819 --> 01:06:19.010 align:start position:0%
members who I represent my clients feel
that

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
um unless we until we can know the towns
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
the areas exactly identify that this
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
would impact we feel it's premature if
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
we could be provided with a list and be
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
assured by those communities that they
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
don't have people that will be left
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
without then I think we could have a
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
different conversation but we don't have
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
that information or data right now and
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be obstructionists we
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
do understand that technology and
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
progress have to move forward but we do
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
have to look out for the best interests
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
of our clients who actually represent
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
the same constituents and taxpayers you
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
know that that you all do so we want to
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not leaving anybody
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
without so you're not getting the phone
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
call saying
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have any options
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
um we so we are willing to listen to any
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
type of solutions that we could come up
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
with and I think again that reassurance
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
that this is the areas that it will
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
impact these are the residents this is
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
the community I think that helps
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
everybody move forward in a different
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
way right now we're just hearing
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotally who it might impact we're
 
01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
not seeing on on paper who it might
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
impact SO waiting until the map's
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
available and then and then seeing I
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
think revisiting the map is going to be
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
um I believe and I believe that
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
again we continue to make great strides
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
I think the commissioner of Bea said
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
that we were they were hanging 20 miles
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
a week a day or a week of of fiber um up
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
by the co-op and of course Consolidated
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
just got that award they're going to be
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know they move very quickly in this
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
build out so I think it just really
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the amendment and and how um
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
or the bill itself and and how it you
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
just you all decide on the policy to
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we have to continue to
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
voice our concerns or potentially
 
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.510 align:start position:0%
voice our concerns or potentially
opposition

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
opposition
um

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
um looking at this Devil's Advocate if
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
this was able to pass would this and
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's already moving fast already would
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
this not just help push everything
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
forward faster than what it has in the
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
last three times this bill's failed
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think I have mixed thoughts on
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
that because Senate Bill 222 was just
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
itl then the Senate which would have
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowed revenue bonds to be taken out
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a Communications District of
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
16 towns up north being in Carroll
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
County being created because they cannot
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
get anyone to come in for middle and
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
last mile of broadband and the state did
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
not identify them as the priority need
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
for some of these other grants right now
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
so that's an example where
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're still kind of in a Lurch you know
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
we have 16 towns that know they want to
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
do something they're trying to form
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
their Communications District to exhaust
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
every opportunity and they can't get any
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
individual provider or P3 public-private
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
partnership to work with them they've
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
tried for the last several years so to
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
say that'll help this move forward I
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
can't I can't speak to whether or not
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
that will be the case because of course
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
if I just came from Private Industry I'm
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
going to invest where there's density
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
and profit and this is a digital Equity
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
issue as well as a for us in emergency
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
services issue so I think
 
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.510 align:start position:0%
services issue so I think
um

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's a double-edged sword
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
still right now to to we I don't have a
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
crystal ball to know whether or not
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
that'll that'll go through but we do
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
have 16 towns in Carroll County that
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.789 align:start position:0%
have 16 towns in Carroll County that
cannot

01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
get anything moving forward with that
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
middle and last mile of broadband and
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
they're considered most some of them are
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know that this would
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
create the incentives to go there if
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
there's already companies that are not
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
willing to partner that are already
 
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
willing to partner that are already
there

01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
um just along those lines isn't
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
isn't something better than nothing
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know I mean it's it's clear that if
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
we wait until everything is in place and
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
and yeah it could be years it could be
 
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
years and these these people
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I mean I'm kind of along
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
the lines of you know
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't it be better to push
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
so gently but push so so I think we have
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
um shared that I think if there were the
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
towns and cities identified and we had
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
actual that actual data we could feel
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
more comfortable in going back to our
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
members but of course I am the voice of
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
234 and I can't I can't speak on their
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
behalf whether or not as the legislation
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
is currently written our members are not
 
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.250 align:start position:0%
is currently written our members are not
comfortable

01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
um moving forward I
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know my personal opinions
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
aside or anything else that's that's
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
what I am I'm here to advocate for and
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
here to support and we appreciate that
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're listening to our concerns and
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
again we acknowledge that other states
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
are doing this and have done this and
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
Technology's moving forward we're not
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying that nothing's impossible
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
um but the flexibility right now in the
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is a concern of ours
 
01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
legislation is a concern of ours
um

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm just a little concerned that
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
maybe we're dragging our feet
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
um because we're just not comfortable
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
with the technology or something so I
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
mean we we've got to move forward at
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
some point you know and yeah and the
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
policies are certainly all you know yeah
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
but you also said you you have not
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
reviewed the amendment no I have I have
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
I have reviewed the amendment um and you
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
just haven't brought it back I I but we
 
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
got it last night so I I can't get it to
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know yeah our our members um quickly
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
enough um for the turnaround to say
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
whether or not they feel more
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable again I do know that if the
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
carrier of Last Resort could demonstrate
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
the locations in which they would like
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
to be relief from again I think those
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
are the types of
 
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.970 align:start position:0%
are the types of
con

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
con
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
those are the types that's the type of
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
information our members have shared
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
would be tremendously helpful to having
 
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
would be tremendously helpful to having
them

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
um decide whether or not it
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
they can be more comfortable with this
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
type of legislation so representative
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
munz um I was the one that said to take
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
the towns out but it sounds like it's
 
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you so much for this
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity we really appreciate you
 
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:54.050 align:start position:0%
opportunity we really appreciate you
listening

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
I know that we talked about I mean I
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
heard the number 20 000 for population
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
bandied about like you know it sort of
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
applied to tens of over 20 000. so
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
um if we were to say use that as a cut
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
off that would be 13 towns and cities
 
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Amanda Noonan with the
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.669 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
um

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
I will start by saying I have not had an
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review this amendment
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
thoroughly or with anyone else at the
 
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
department so I can't comment
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
um on the content with other than what
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
I've heard this morning so I would just
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
offer that
 
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.410 align:start position:0%
offer that
um

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
I think representative Thomas you
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
flagged the line in the possible
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the department providing
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
support and funding we have no funding
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
available to provide any type of support
 
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.330 align:start position:0%
available to provide any type of support
um

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:55.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
we would be challenged I think to
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
but challenge is perhaps not the right
 
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.669 align:start position:0%
but challenge is perhaps not the right
word

01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable providing an individual
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
resident of the state with a
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation about what service
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
provider they should choose for their
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
telecommunications service if they found
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
themselves in a situation where their
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
landline provider or their landline
 
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:25.460 align:start position:0%
service was going away for some reason
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that were
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable telling residents in the
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
state whether they should choose a
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
competitive electric supplier for their
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
energy piece of their electric bill
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
and if so who they should pick were
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
hesitant or uncomfortable weighing in on
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
those choices that are very individual
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
and up to the customer in terms of
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
providing information about options that
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
are out there that would is something
 
01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:01.219 align:start position:0%
that we could certainly do would require
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
some coordinated effort to to identify
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
and reach out to all the various
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
providers within the state that are
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
offering a basic service option whether
 
01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.050 align:start position:0%
offering a basic service option whether
it's

01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:14.060 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.669 align:start position:0%
it's
uh

01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
IP enabled
 
01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:19.130 align:start position:0%
IP enabled
um

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
some other Wireless some other type of
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
service we could make that information
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
available but I I would want to stop at
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
that point and then we'll leave the
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
actual decision making
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
up to the customer wouldn't it be
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a list like that at the
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
doe I mean
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
could that be an unattended positive
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
consequence of this bill
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
I think it would be very helpful I think
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would be challenging because not all
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
providers are required to register in
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as the
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications provider before they
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
start doing sir doing business in the
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
Ripple out effect of the deregulation
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
that happens 10 plus years ago if you're
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
a provider of
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
IP voice IP service you don't have to
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
register it's a voluntary registration
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
process so we would we would need to do
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
some Outreach ourselves in order to
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
figure out how to identify all these
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
individuals or all these companies
 
01:16:28.679 --> 01:16:32.709 align:start position:0%
individuals or all these companies
rather

01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.719 --> 01:16:34.330 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:34.340 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
unattainable but it would it would
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
require some work
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
um the other comment I would make is
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
as I said having not had the opportunity
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
to vet this throughout the agency I'm
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
not sure if there would be some sort of
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on the department itself
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
through this whole process you don't
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
think that this changes it significantly
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
enough from the original bill that
 
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
there'd be you know if we hired a
 
01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.790 align:start position:0%
there'd be you know if we hired a
consultant

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
those consultant costs are allocated to
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
the utility bringing the petition and so
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have an impact but I would
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
just want the opportunity to kind of run
 
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:17.300 align:start position:0%
that through other folks's Minds before
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
do you do you haven't excuse me an
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
estimation of how many petitions would
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
would this would result in
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
I don't listening to the conversation
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
this morning it doesn't sound like there
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
would be many at least on the part of
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
Consolidated but I I really don't have a
 
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.090 align:start position:0%
Consolidated but I I really don't have a
sense

01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
is a 180 day or six month window to
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide final approval is that
 
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.090 align:start position:0%
provide final approval is that
appropriate

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about that as the
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
conversation was going on this morning
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
and whether that would be adequate time
 
01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.410 align:start position:0%
and whether that would be adequate time
um

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know I think we would have to
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
discuss that internally and discuss
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a two-step process there's
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
the initial review where the department
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
quickly reading through would say this
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
looks like you've met the requirements
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
but you know go do this other piece and
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
then I think my final decision we may be
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about whether that's sufficient
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
time to follow this this whole thing
 
01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:24.050 align:start position:0%
time to follow this this whole thing
through

01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
and should the the puc be involved in
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the puc has no jurisdiction or under
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
the current statutory
 
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.430 align:start position:0%
the current statutory
um

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
situation over this portion of
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunications service
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
and I think you heard earlier this
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
morning from Ms Davis that
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate has no role in
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
telecommunications proceedings before
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
the commission or involvement in
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
telecommunications services that was
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation that was passed
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
um in an earlier Bill I'm sorry I didn't
 
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.770 align:start position:0%
um in an earlier Bill I'm sorry I didn't
I just

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
in my own little world
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
um in an earlier Bill we heard about
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
some complaints that were essentially
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
lost at the POC and in process of being
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
transitioned to doe
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
um do you envision
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
sort of some of these petitions going to
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
Never Never Land
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
even I mean
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
I do do you know what I'm talking about
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
those the the bills where they
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
we were moving something from puc to doe
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
and and one of the utilities got up and
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
said that their complaint had been like
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was nine months and they hadn't heard
 
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.209 align:start position:0%
it was nine months and they hadn't heard
anything

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm well so we had her to
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
build something like that or in a
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
hearing that's why I'm wondering if we
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
should have penalties um attached to
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
some of these timelines either make them
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
realistic or or have some kind of
 
01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.530 align:start position:0%
realistic or or have some kind of
penalty

01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
sort of I'm I'm not ex I'm not exact
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
exactly asking your your for an answer
 
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
on this I'm just putting this out as as
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
a concern so if there are things that
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be transferred to the
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
department that the department hasn't
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with they seem to be very
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing what those are I'm
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
um that would fall in that category
 
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:42.110 align:start position:0%
um that would fall in that category
uh

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's policy decision
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether you think there needs to be some
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
sort of consequence about what happens
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
if the department didn't make a
 
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.649 align:start position:0%
if the department didn't make a
determination

01:20:50.649 --> 01:20:50.659 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
I can offer as a perhaps a comparison of
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission has by
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
Statute 12 months to rule on a rate case
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
and if they don't make a ruling the
 
01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:06.140 align:start position:0%
utility can put the rates into effect
 
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:09.260 align:start position:0%
without a an order from the commission
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
better way to look at some sort of
 
01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
in in doing my homework last night that
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
I was looking through the rsas and
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
there's there's a section on Telephone
 
01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:34.580 align:start position:0%
utilities service territories
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
basically it says if two or more
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
telephone utilities find that they
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
provide the same service in the same
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
area or that existing Maps create
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
overlapping service territories the
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
department of energy upon application by
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
one or both of the affected utilities
 
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
shall Define alter or establish service
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
territories and then they list six
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
criteria for the Department to consider
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
and then the the the the the statute
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
elaborates uh about the department of
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
Energy's authority to make that power
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
and and and to actually do it and I was
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if we added a carriers
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort obligations to that
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
section in that consideration would that
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
give you a mechanism to to deal with
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
I would need to take that question back
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
and have our general counsel take a look
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
at that and see what it might look like
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to do that and send the
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
information back
 
01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:41.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I was going to ask you
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment here and
 
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
obviously it looks like G could pretty
 
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
much be eliminated
 
01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
which is what what I've been marking
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
here listening to everybody
 
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.090 align:start position:0%
here listening to everybody
um

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
how does I don't think it necessarily
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
needs to be eliminated I think it it I
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
mean they can provide a list without
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
making a suggestion yeah I mean the
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
people need to find out what's available
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah and G also puts the uh
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know makes it clear that the
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
utilities the telephone companies are
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
responsible for helping as well yeah
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
I just think that last sentence needs to
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
be removed we have a lot of symptoms
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
anyway the last half of the sentence
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
anyway they can provide support or
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
resources or something or list but no
 
01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.669 align:start position:0%
resources or something or list but no
funding

01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I'm I'm for this I'm
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
actually for the sought to pass for the
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment the only thing it was like the
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
last sentence of G and then I've been
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
debating on on D with the changing the
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
shell on the first instead of two of May
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um but then again it's 180 days so
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I keep leaning back towards
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I still want um to flag the
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
newspaper I just think that's antiquated
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable you know you say it's
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
Antiquated but
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
every I mean like I have a major project
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the North country and it's going to
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
be the final hearing on it it's all done
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
by newspaper yeah but some towns don't
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
have it like Merrimack doesn't have a
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
local newspaper anymore I mean so
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
Nicolas is pretty thin on them but it's
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
the only way we yeah it's still the way
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
it is you know that was brought up in
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
there was a bill filed in um Judiciary
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
when it was on Judiciary two last year I
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
had two committees and that that's it is
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's an evolving problem but we're not
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
to the electronic stage yet that's why I
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
got shot down well I mean I'm all for
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
putting it in a local newspaper but
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
maybe Also let's modernize and put it on
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
a website as well you know the utilities
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
are not utilities the provider's website
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
it is we heard the Judiciary link last
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
year about this
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I asked one of the lawyers if we
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
could put hyperlinks and bills and he's
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
like no no we can't do that I think it
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
is reasonable though to say that it
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
should be on the municipalities website
 
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
should be on the municipalities website
is

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I know I can't make a motion on
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't exist yet but I'm
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm for
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with a updated Amendment
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense what what about what
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
about you know the the um the way it's
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
structured now it basically has a
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
preliminary approval
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
and then a hearing public hearing
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
and then a final approval I mean are we
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
are we okay with that preliminary
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
approval or do we want to just you know
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
Skip that
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's in B and um
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some concern that
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with it but
 
01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.790 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with it but
um

01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
but without that 30 days is it going to
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
be extended
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
further than 30 days
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
the concern was that the 30 days didn't
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
give doe enough time if if we scrap the
 
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.890 align:start position:0%
give doe enough time if if we scrap the
preliminary

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
well no I wasn't saying if we scrap the
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
preliminary the preliminary gives them
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
and the way the way it's currently
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
written it says you told the telephone
 
01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
company comes to the doe and says hey we
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
want to submit this petition
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
and then doe says okay you've met the
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
criteria that we've set fine we give you
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
preliminary approval and they'll do that
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
within 30 days
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
and then you have to but then they have
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
and then get to get the information from
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the public hearing back to the doe and
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
then they would make a final decision
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
based on that and is there a template
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
for this petition like they they a
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
checklist they know they have to include
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
this and this and this and this or do
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
they they have to meet the criteria
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's laid out in in above which is the
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know it has to meet the 95 or 97
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
threshold or it's got to be in an area
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
where there's federal or state funding
 
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's been right but are we requiring
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
specific documents from them to prove
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
this that's I think up to the doe yeah
 
01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.050 align:start position:0%
this that's I think up to the doe yeah
okay

01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:14.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
well I'm just a little concerned how are
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
we going to require this if we don't
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's I I don't necessarily need an
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
answer right now I'm just it's a concern
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
well I think that's where you've got to
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
be careful we don't get too much into
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
the weeds well yeah that's true too the
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
the section that I referenced earlier
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
talks about service territories when
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
when there's a dispute that the doe has
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to go through and resolve it
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
the the RSA that you referenced earlier
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay a lot of that is built in
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
there so in the amendment we could
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
actually reference that yeah yeah that
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
would be good and are we going to put a
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
list of towns
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
well that that's what I'm struggling
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
with I mean it seems like
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
you don't think so
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
yeah it just seems to be that's the
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
thing that would give some comfort to
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association that you know
 
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.930 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association that you know
that

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:27.169 align:start position:0%
that
okay

01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
the only way the only reason why I'm
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
against it is like you're saying we were
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
talking about providing a push it's been
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
three years three times this has failed
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that uh if we do towns then we're
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
gonna find those outskirts will just
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
stay out of it forever they'll just
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
continue on and continue on what have
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
been the objections to this in Prior
 
01:29:47.219 --> 01:29:50.410 align:start position:0%
been the objections to this in Prior
times

01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
yeah you said it's been rejected three
 
01:29:52.739 --> 01:29:53.629 align:start position:0%
yeah you said it's been rejected three
times

01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
um this the same bill has come up the
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
last three sessions and it's been it's
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
been two last session and it was uh It
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
Was Defeated and it was because of the
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh the lack of capability for the
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
smaller towns outside so for the same
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
but what are we doing to address that
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
concern we're not really doing anything
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
the only right so far the only thing
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
we've been doing is uh
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
basically been relying on the
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications companies to move
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
further out we have ourselves haven't
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
done anything legislatively to change
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
time here I mean things have changed
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
like they were saying here I mean
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like 100 years ago what's
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
happened in this evolution of this whole
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
thing especially since covet I know up
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
in my area is in school but
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
this is really it's an evolving it's
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
evolving like I said and I do agree with
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
them a little bit of uh
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
flexibility in this is uh what they were
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
looking for so
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
I guess I was just thinking of something
 
01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:02.570 align:start position:0%
I guess I was just thinking of something
not

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
probably not the way we should be doing
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislation but as I understand that the
 
01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
map's supposed to be available by the
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
end of this month
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
and if this bill if we if we were the
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill this way and it gets passed and
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
then it has to go to the Senate well the
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
Senate then has an opportunity they will
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
have they will get a chance to see the
 
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.129 align:start position:0%
have they will get a chance to see the
map

01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:22.139 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then that could be where it could be
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your intelligence
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
um the 374 reference to the service
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
territories just to be clear that's
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
really about the incumbent local
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
exchange carrier so Consolidated has
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
this territory and Granite State
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
telephone has this territory it it's
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
talking about telephone utilities those
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
are the only telephone utilities this
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill is really talking about all the
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
other providers of services that are
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
overlapping so I don't I don't think
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
that'll fix it it'll just it just the
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
only purpose of that statute is if us
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
and Granite State both think this road
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
is in our territory they're supposed to
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
resolve who actually owns it
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I I actually don't think it it helps
 
01:32:26.090 --> 01:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay so representative munz you've got
 
01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:31.139 align:start position:0%
some homework to do
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to take another crack at
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
this and I can circulate it to everybody
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
and then before we send it to OLS
 
01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.750 align:start position:0%
and then before we send it to OLS
experience

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're the leap of faith that that
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
I make the motion ought to pass with
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Monson updated amendment
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'll what I'll do if it's all right
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
with everybody I'll and I'll try to do
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
it today I'll
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
take what I've given you and I'll try to
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
incorporate what I thought I heard in
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
terms of the few changes we need to make
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
get it to everybody so we can take
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
everybody take a look at it and then
 
01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
once we're okay with it I'll get it over
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
to OLS and tell them we need it on
 
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.450 align:start position:0%
to OLS and tell them we need it on
Tuesday

01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have to uh
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
get to vote
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that was kind of glossed over
 
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:55.930 align:start position:0%
yeah that was kind of glossed over
foreign

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
s yes representative Noel yes

representative Summers yes
 
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.669 align:start position:0%
representative Summers yes

okay
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
as probable Amendment we can't vote on
