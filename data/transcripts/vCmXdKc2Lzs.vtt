1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Okay, we'll open up the committee conference.

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
On House bill 12.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Very much 1 of mine.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
1236.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
okay.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm in the right place.

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:43,500
um so, we have a little conversation here just to make sure and we understand all the pieces.

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Obviously, in terms of the underlying bill, there was never any issue of the underlying bill for commerce.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,500
We were, we would just had these other 2 things were added to it and they were money.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,500
So that put me in a little bit of a panic without knowing anything about them.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:22,500
I have now been educated that we don't want to have a force overtime on state employees, and it would make matters worse rather than better.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,000
So that's why that was added to the bill.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Representative Leon had some concerns with it, and she is now feeling comfortable.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:46,500
So I guess I'll do something I don't normally do, but is there anybody in the room has any problem with us concurring with this legislation?

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Okay, so.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
So, thank you, Mr.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Chair.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:05,000
I would just say that the fiscal committee last week, I think it was last week, approved $5 million for the Community Mental Health Center.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the part four of that is a request of the department.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:03:05,500
It obviously does have $670,000 of fund in it, but it'll try to prevent the problem that came from the medicaid expansion unwind and a state law that requires continued treatment of mental health patients so that's what that piece is about i think mr monahan was here he and he brought it to us the department signed off on it um so it's i think well worth the expenditure okay so is everybody okay with this then okay so i'll make a motion that uh the house will see to the senate position um and on house bill 1236 period all those in favor please say aye aye.

31
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Aye.

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Those opposed, so move unanimously.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will have that drawn up.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right, we have 15 minutes.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank you.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
okay we'll um open up the uh committee conference on uh house bill 1633.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:33,500
um so at this point i is we're going to the discussion will start on the house side and in terms of things that they want, because I'm going to run on the premise that the house is going to a seed to the Senate.

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Version and now what we, we house members would like to request to it to to amend this bill with.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:05:24,000
So I will will go around with this group here and I will start with my Democratic leader of the Commerce Committee and and you want to do what are the issues that you would like to see addressed in this bill and I guess we'll probably try to go wrong trying to you know where it is in the is in the bill so that when, if we do go forward, we know what we're, we're fixing at the time.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Um, what we would like to see for this in terms of, uh, the things that we would like to see is to decrease the decriminalization level to two ounces.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Um, this would allow for higher limits immediately while delaying the smoking in public and other penalties.

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
So where's that in the bill?

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Do we know?

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
No, no.

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm just telling you my...

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just telling you the things that we'd like to see.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,500
We think that that would be a cleaner solution than moving everything up to immediately.

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:25,000
We'd like to see the 12.5 tax fee and the Rosenwald Amendment for ATC preference.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And in terms of consuming from the passenger prohibitions, we'd like to remove medicinal edibles from that prohibition.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Those are our big four.

78
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Okay.

79
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Anything from...

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Sure.

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
May I just turn it for a minute?

82
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Sure.

83
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
For discussion.

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Sure.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:10,000
minute uh sure thank you from um going back and listening to the floor debate from last week, I identified kind of 3 buckets of votes that need to be shifted from no to yes.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And this amendment represents addressing those 3 buckets.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, the 1st piece here is just a clean up the no person shall smoke or vaporize while in a passenger or motor vehicle.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
We can skip that for the moment.

89
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
The next section here refers to.

90
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,000
What my colleague was referencing with regard to the Rosenwald amendment.

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I took what was the simplest and fewest possible words to add in order to address that concern.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:57,500
If you'll see this refers to page 14 of the Senate version of the bill toward the bottom of the page.

93
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And just adds first state of New Hampshire or second another state.

94
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Okay.

95
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, and the second piece decreases the franchise fee.

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
From 15% to 12 and a half percent.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That you'll see from lines 14 to 17.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
14 to 17.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then the entire rest of this amendment refers to what my colleague mentioned as far as lowering the decrim limit from REST OF THIS AMENDMENT REFERS TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED AS FAR AS LOWERING THE DECRIM LIMIT FROM OR I GUESS RAISING IT FROM THREE QUARTER OUNCE TO TWO OUNCE.

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:32,500
What I found to be a large source of objection among House members was that they were looking forward to on day one legalizing up to two ounces and pulling the rug out from under that idea really took the wind out of the sails of being able to get it passed in the house so knowing that that was not going to be able to be moved i thought this was kind of a a way to give those members what they're looking for without changing the effective date of the legalization.

101
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
MR.

102
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Yep.

103
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,000
So, I guess we're all set then?

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,500
So yes, now it's balls in your court now.

107
00:09:48,500 --> 00:10:02,500
So, uh, so again, online, um, you're basically saying it's okay if you have an edible, but the past, but they can't take and consume, which would impact.

108
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes.

109
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:20,000
So what I had heard was that the intention of that section, which is found on page 7, line 11 of the Senate version of 1633, just removed the word consume.

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:43,500
so left smoke and vaporize as I understood this was the intention to not have you know secondhand smoke being ingested by the driver and then I thought more importantly THIS WAS THE INTENTION TO NOT HAVE, YOU KNOW, SECOND HAND SMOKE BEING INJESTED BY THE DRIVER.

111
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,500
AND THEN I THOUGHT MORE IMPORTANTLY, KEEPING THE STENCH OFF THE ROAD.

112
00:10:49,500 --> 00:11:01,500
BECAUSE I NOTICED ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M RIDING AROUND ON MY MOTORCYCLE, CATCHING THOSE WAFTS AS I'M RIDING AROUND, IT KIND OF UPSETS MY DAY.

113
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
FURTHER QUESTION.

114
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:24,000
SO AGAIN, STARTING ON SECTION 8, THEN, THIS SECTION STRIKLY IS LOOK this section strictly is looking to give preference to any business in the hamster that's already doing cannabis first before giving preference to a business from out of state.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Correct.

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,500
I guess what I heard was that our existing in-state businesses would like to see preference given to them, as you might have.

117
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:49,000
THAT OUR EXISTING IN-STATE BUSINESSES WOULD LIKE TO SEE PREFERENCE GIVEN TO THEM AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE OVER EXISTING BUSINESSES FROM OTHER STATES.

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yep.

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:03,500
So I'm going to ignore the tax one, the fee charge for right now, and that is pretty much either a yes or a no.

120
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
That moves down.

121
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,000
The next part of the language again.

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:40,000
tax one the fee charge for right now and that is pretty much either a yes or a no um that moved down the next part of the language again is you're looking at considering the intent of the bill in 2026 will be to legalize two outs we just want to decriminalize up to that amount um temporarily until the legalization.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Correct.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then the, uh, so the question about this, uh, in, in the car.

125
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Um, that I, I did some homework on.

126
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The open container statute um and so the open container statute um has an exemption um and that is a not a person's transporting carrying possessing or having any liquor or beverage in a chartered bus taxi limousine for hire provided however the driver of any said vehicle is prohibited from having any liquor or beverage in or around the driver's area so in terms of lifting that section, and then the other thing, the piece that I just heard today was if if.

127
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The passenger, not the driver, if the passenger happens to be a carrier card, carrying medical.

128
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
medical exemption person should they also have the happens to be a carrier card carrying medical.

129
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Exemption person should they also have the right to be able to take a edible?

130
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Obviously, they can't smoke it in the car because that would be distracting to the driver.

131
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Um, you have an edible that they could if they needed to in that emergency situation.

132
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,500
And so you guys want to go talk about it?

133
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, I have a question.

134
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yep.

135
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So thank you.

136
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just want to, again, working from the amendment, on line 10, it says the laws of the state of New Hampshire or second another state.

137
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So I understand by saying second, it is lowering in priority someone who has cannabis experience in another state as opposed to the ATCs operating in New Hampshire.

138
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Am I reading that correctly?

139
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
That was my intention, yes.

140
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay.

141
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:13,500
I would say that I did have a conversation with the liquor commissioner, and he said that when you apply an application, they have a scoring system.

142
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:31,000
And he recommended that we might consider that anyone who is currently in ATC would get a bonus 15 points before the rest of the application is considered as a way to address that issue.

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Through rules or with this language?

144
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I would say we would put it in the statute.

145
00:15:39,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah language would allow that no I'm saying that I'm not sure this language would allow that that be interpreted that but that if we wanted to clarify what's the language that you guys put in which is that previous marijuana experience you know uh I we could do it uh when we write the blurb i've done that before that in the blurb saying that what the what the legislative intent is of that concept is is that or we can write it in statue or we could just uh you know give guidance that yes that when they do rulemaking for that application that the implication is that favoritism is by adding uh points scoring yeah i i think it would be hard i i'm not sure that we can put it in statute i'm totally open to working that out because i do understand that um just as we recognized in the senate version uh in some of the work we did in the Senate to talk, to recognize the importance of recognizing New Hampshire farmers, we want to recognize New Hampshire businesses and New Hampshire ATCs.

146
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know that we actually know what the application or the point system will be, so it may be difficult to do in legislation, but I'm open to working through that.

147
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Right, and I would remind you that this really is only an ATC problem because we have no limit on licensures for cultivators.

148
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Maybe you hadn't thought of that.

149
00:17:44,500 --> 00:18:28,500
The intent of that segment is strictly all things being equal between an in-state and out-of-state you give preference to the end state right so that would be a simple one but he was saying if you wanted to how how a good way to do it is to simply say not just in-state out-of-state because who knows somebody out with some other of, because you just simply said that had this marijuana experience and we're assuming that the only people who have marijuana experience is the ATCs.

150
00:18:28,500 --> 00:19:05,000
But he was saying is if you really wanted to be much more direct, then you would just spell it out to say they get an extra 15 points scoring or extra scoring or something that along that line that would give them a heads up and i did discuss this with the atcs and they are they they are positive about that approach can we look at page 5 section section 37?

151
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Are there you'd best describe to us in excruciating detail any changes that have been made in effective dates?

152
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
So what line are we in?

153
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm sorry, my room in rules takes me a little little moment.

154
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
Starting on number seven, right?

155
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,500
So what sections did you leave in?

156
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
What did you take out?

157
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We're working from the Senate version.

158
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,500
Did you make any changes to any effective dates other than the decrim?

159
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,000
The decrim is, at this point, that's the only thing we're discussing, yeah.

160
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,500
I did not hear anybody else mentioning any other date changes.

161
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,000
I guess speak now forevermore.

162
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:12,500
So, Pete, Jason, on your section on effective date 37, is there any difference in which portions of this bill we put off and which ones were acting immediately from the Senate version.

163
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Everything remains the same other than that 6, 7, 8.

164
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,000
And that's all the proposal on Decret.

165
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

166
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

167
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,500
My last question is simply as I'm reading this, I see the change in the tax from 15 to 12 and a half.

168
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
There's no change.

169
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,000
There is no accommodation for therapeutic cannabis to not be taxed in any of this.

170
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No change.

171
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you.

172
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:12,000
no change i'm gonna probably take a break so the seneca caucus and chat i doubt well i think it's going to take more than just a break coming back in 10 minutes so i suggest that we establish a recess sometime okay Okay.

173
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So, we're talking about the 5th.

174
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
I do have 1 p.m.

175
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000

180
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you.

349
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Thank you.

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

351
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Thank you.

352
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Thank you.

353
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Thank you.

354
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Thank you.

355
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you.

356
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Thank you.

357
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Thank you.

358
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Thank you.

359
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Thank you.

360
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Thank you.

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Thank you.

362
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Thank you.

363
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Thank you.

364
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Thank you.

365
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

366
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank you.

367
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Thank you.

368
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you.

369
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you.

370
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Thank you.

371
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Thank you.

372
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Thank you.

373
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Thank you.

374
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Thank you.

375
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Thank you.

376
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
you well okay Okay, community conference.

377
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,500
If it's Tuesday, it must be 12.

378
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Don't.

379
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
This is 1018.

380
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Okay.

381
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
1018.

382
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Oh, yeah, because I put a pencil mark to it.

383
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Okay, 1018.

384
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Relative on-premise, off-premise liquor licenses in relative land in current use.

385
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,500
So this is the one that has something about...

386
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Current use is a misleading thing, but it just happens to be the statute.

387
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:25,500
It was, this is about protecting our border border so you want to tell us about this it allows people to post their land with the six um activities outlined in the bill um also land for no trespass for skiing, snowshoeing, fishing, hunting, hiking, or nature observation without losing their special discount for current use.

388
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:34,500
And then, obviously, if somebody is trespassing, it would enable local law enforcement to arrest somebody for trespass.

389
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,000
So that's the premise of the bill.

390
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:51,500
And I believe the House actually passed that bill, and you added the House version of bail fixes, 318, which is having a committee, a conference tomorrow.

391
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Right.

392
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,000
So we non-concurred with that, knowing the House had passed bail.

393
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And so we attached it to, we attached 504, Senate Bill 504 to 1018.

394
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
Don't think there's any problem with 1018.

395
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:19,000
And based on your earlier vote on Senate Bill 504, I don't think there's any problem with that either.

396
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,500
So you're saying with current use, because I have land in current use.

397
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Yes.

398
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,500
And my land just has specific things that I posted for, right?

399
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,500
You can, under the current law, you can post it.

400
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Okay.

401
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,500
For those six things that I just read.

402
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Okay.

403
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
These say you can't do them.

404
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
And still receive.

405
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Right.

406
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:01,000
So right now, my sign says no snowmobiles, no dirt bikes, no hunting, no firearms.

407
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,500
Do you get an extra?

408
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:23,500
And I absolutely have my land in current use okay but do you get the extra discount because the extra discount allows um recreational activities on that land and no trespass except for skiing snowsho hunting, hiking, or nature observation.

409
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
That's the current law now.

410
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,500
All this does is allow somebody to post their land and retain the extra discount.

411
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Those six things would not constitute trespass.

412
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
How much of a discount do you get over or above it?

413
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
20%.

414
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's over.

415
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Right now I pay like on a 200 acre piece.

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I only paid $120 or something.

417
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Nothing.

418
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I think for larger pieces of property that are like timber concerns and things like that in the North country, it's probably a little bit more money than what you're paying for 200 acres.

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay.

420
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So I got you.

421
00:32:18,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I mean, the Forest Society, not the Forest Society, the Farm Bureau and the Jason Scott, his guys, came into the Senate hearing, asked for us to amend the bill to ensure that um it would not impact the 20 discount for people those people who yeah so i and the house passed that as i recall i'd have to pull it up um but it did so why did you attach it to one of our bills what was because when you passed it you attached your version of bail no not not me not commerce the house no not why did you just attach it to judiciary bills why would you why would you want to make my life miserable John why would you make my life miserable over some of your bills I didn't touch any on Jermaine amendments.

422
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
We've become best friends again.

423
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes, we have.

424
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,500
And you reminded me, we came into the house together.

425
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
That's right.

426
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
1990.

427
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:53,000
And we both were, Sierra Club, we got Sierra Club lifetime memberships because we both had perfect voting records that year.

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah, that year.

429
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Now we have gray hair.

430
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
That ain't happening probably ever again.

431
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
So, okay.

432
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Representative Hammond.

433
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,000
So I just want to understand the concept here.

434
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,500
a landowner can post no trespassing sign and not receive a discount, right?

435
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
They lose the discount.

436
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
That's my understanding.

437
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:30,500
So in order to receive the extra discount, this would allow them to post for no trespass except for those six activities.

438
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,000
And the language of the sign is prescribed by statute here.

439
00:34:36,000 --> 00:35:23,000
they'd have to put that that doesn't change okay and so this would open up more land for these six things skiing snow showing it would allow property owners who want to avail themselves of the discount to be able to post their land for uh no trespass except for those six activities and then um you know along the northern border when people were interdicted they could be interdicted for trespass what if they were nature observing if they were doing any of those activities there'd be a presumption of no problem Okay.

440
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Representative Burrows.

441
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yes.

442
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,500
I was wondering how this bill would impact the um enforcement on the border for illegal crossings.

443
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,000
How would this impact that?

444
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So if somebody were to be detained for trespass, then if they were not in this country with proper documentation, they could be detained.

445
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,500
Where currently, right now, my understanding is they couldn't be detained.

446
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:04,500
So this was a request of the attorney general to me, which is why I sponsored the bill.

447
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:20,500
So if somebody, just to understand, somebody's hiking, you know, with these signs, they're hiking, and would law enforcement be able to question them if they suspect that they're, they're here illegally.

448
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Uh, yeah, I would assume so.

449
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,000
So again, I'm looking at the house.

450
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Um, docket.

451
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What passed 17 to nothing in the committee report and I assume it was.

452
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Thank you.

453
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What passed 17 to nothing in the committee report and I assume it was.

454
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,500
I can't remember which committee criminal justice.

455
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:59,500
And then the committee report was on to pass and it went to the floor and was passed on the voicemail on.

456
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:08,000
You know, I did talk to Chairman Roy Roy and he did say to me that that.

457
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They were okay with this amendment.

458
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,500
Okay, look, I read the Senate report.

459
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Okay.

460
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:26,000
And there was a lot of discussion in the Senate report about illegal crossings and about data and whatnot.

461
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:39,500
So I guess I'm still trying to connect the dots between that and this bill why there was so much discussion about that in the Senate hearing.

462
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Because currently my understanding is you could not.

463
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,000
Tain somebody for trespass in those circumstances.

464
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And so it just leaves a vulnerability on the northern border, much of which is very remote and very easy to cross.

465
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,500
So there you have it.

466
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:10,000
So I'm still trying to point my finger how this bill is going to work to prevent illegal crossings.

467
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why this specific bill?

468
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Because at least there would be a possibility that somebody could be detained.

469
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Right now, my understanding is that is not the case.

470
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Well, how do you determine if somebody might be illegal?

471
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,500
For example, I live on the National Forest.

472
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,000
I live in the North.

473
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,500
I have a stepson who's actually, he's born and bred in New Hampshire.

474
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,000
He's very dark-skinned, just how he is.

475
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Why would he maybe possibly not be detained if he was hiking in the northern country because he was dark-skinned?

476
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He was hiking.

477
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,500
I don't think anybody would be detained that had any kind of documentation.

478
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,000
So I think it's for people without...

479
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But would he be singled out because maybe he was dark skin and they might say, well, this guy may not be, might not be American.

480
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
How do, I guess I would answer it this way.

481
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
How does law enforcement ever have probable cause?

482
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:51,500
Thank you very much to stop anybody i mean it you're doing something generally speaking that law enforcement whether it's speeding whether it's some other kind of behavior that creates a presumption and then you can be asked and stopped and released or not released.

483
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm just concerned that this is going to be used as an excuse to potentially harass people who, you know, look like they might be from another country.

484
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I mean, my stepson looks like he could be from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, a lot of different countries, and he's all American.

485
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,500
But does he go hiking without his wallet, without his driver's license?

486
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Oh, yeah.

487
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Particularly where we live absolutely goes without his license and all that.

488
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Yeah, he does.

489
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,000
Does he drive in a car to get to that spot?

490
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
To my house?

491
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,500
Yeah, and we go from my house.

492
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,000
He doesn't need his wallet to leave our house.

493
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,500
well, I guess if he's of a certain olive skin, maybe that's a good idea to have a wallet with him.

494
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Oh, John, you don't want to say that.

495
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,000
Well, I'm saying that's what you're implying.

496
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:18,500
If you're a citizen within the United States, you're not supposed to have to require to walk around with documentation unless you're driving a car.

497
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:28,000
If you're just hiking in the woods, you're not supposed to have to have anything as a legal resident.

498
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Right.

499
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But if you were happen to be walking around the National Forest on the on our state on the capital line on the US line, you don't think that maybe it's a good idea.

500
00:41:47,000 --> 00:42:25,500
I mean, I'm not expecting you to carry your passport with you but wouldn't you have your wallet with you so that in case you you want to stop at a store and buy a beer i never have my wallet i don't okay all right so let's just say it's true so you're saying that no person that if a person is stopped and clearly does not look like they're camping they've got something backs backside.

501
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:47,000
You're saying that someone could potentially be lightly dressed, doesn't look like they're spending overnight anywhere, they just happen to be crossing the border, and you think a cop isn't going to say, well, gee, you don't look like a camper to me.

502
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,500
Well, I guess the other question is why, you know, again, I'm reading that testimony.

503
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:06,500
There was no, I didn't get a clear answer when people were asking about the stats on the northern border about people coming in.

504
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:16,500
And I'm reading a report here that there were something like 21 people coming through over like a two-year period.

505
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:52,500
So why, I guess, why this those stats are totally misleading okay having been any stats on the report having i get that okay but if you've gone to pittsburgh like i did okay and several of our colleagues in the senate and you've actually driven out along what's called Hall Streams Road, Hall Stream Road, which is a seven-mile-long dirt road right on the border between Canada and the United States.

506
00:43:52,500 --> 00:44:02,000
And you see a stream that's maybe three times as wide as this table, and probably about that deep.

507
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:36,500
And how remote it it is getting any law enforcement there with any kind of alacrity is almost impossible and the people we met at a farm up there owned by a gentleman keith robinson and they have seen people they have seen signs of people that have left markers in the road that then come out of the forest, get in a car, drive away, and they're gone.

508
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:49,000
So the fact that the law enforcement capability up there is so slim that you have to drive 35 to 40 minutes to get there.

509
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,500
That's why the statistics are the way they are.

510
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
It's very, very misleading.

511
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,000
If I could say further.

512
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I have been there.

513
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,500
I did not get to go with the Senate a couple weeks ago.

514
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
But I've been there.

515
00:45:08,500 --> 00:46:27,500
i do work up at all the schools in the north and i do pittsburgh elementary school i'm replacing their curtains and the music teacher there said would you like to meet my husband he's a border patrol agent i said i'd love to meet your husband and he told me about the 7 000 encounters they've had in the squantum section and he said yes we may only have 21 people that we caught but he said the signs of other people there's like canoes all over the place left when they're crossing he said we only have caught 21 how many have got away because we we don't have the enforcement capabilities at the time we don't have the personnel he estimates it's far in excess of that 21 low number that they've used so again there's 7 000 that we know in the area of ma Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont called the Squantum region.

516
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
7,000?

517
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Could you explain that?

518
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Where's that number from?

519
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
7,000 interactions.

520
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:46,000
CPB, Customs and Border Patrol, in the Squantum sector, which goes from the main border to somewhere in upstate New York.

521
00:46:46,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So it's, I think, about a 250 mile, um, segment 50 miles roughly is in New Hampshire, obviously some of Vermont and then some in New Hampshire and border apprehensions this year alone, when we were up there were over 7,000 in the first, I think it was seven months of the fiscal year.

522
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And that exceeded or will exceed the 7,000 that were apprehended last year, according to Customs and Border Patrol stat.

523
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,500
So the problem's real, even though the northern border is incredibly porous, has minimal resources.

524
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:51,500
I'm working to try to get a grant for communications that should have been funded through the Northern Border, whatever it's called, the Northern Border Program, federal funds, and wasn't, so that law enforcement can even have basic communication with each other.

525
00:47:51,500 --> 00:49:16,500
There's next to no email or cell service um up there so you've got a problem that is wide open and people are crossing that border and so this i'm not going to sit here and say this will solve the problem it won't solve the problem it's just one tool in the arsenal we this is the whole justification for the 1.4 million dollars in the budget last year to enhance local law enforcement they feel it is working and that um we need to continue it um you know so i i again i i think this is just common sense one more word it'll be very quick so you were talking about i think your son who's brown skinned i have a nephew and niece and they do hike and they are both korean born um so i share your concern but the border patrol agents that i met are only looking to like anything there could be a bad you know there's a bad cop somewhere.

526
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,500
But overall, I trust in our law enforcement.

527
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:43,500
And if you give articulatable reasons that, you know, my car is down here, my license is there, or it's at my house, and you say, I'm Bill Gannon, I live in X location, these are reasonable people, and they're not looking to bother anyone else.

528
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:51,000
But if they interdict someone, they find out there's a detainer notice against the person.

529
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,500
We want to make a phone call to either the next to Homeland or ICE.

530
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:06,000
But if they interdict someone, they find out there's a detainer notice against the person.

531
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,500
We want to make a phone call to either the next to Homeland or ICE and continue to lie.

532
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:28,000
If they meet your son or my niece or nephew, they're going to say where they live and they're going to let them right go.

533
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Representative Spear.

534
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I if I if I can understand this properly correctly.

535
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,500
So a person trespasses based on the definition that's in this bill, that somebody trespasses.

536
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:53,500
And you mentioned also, it was mentioned that law enforcement might be 35 miles away or maybe it was 35 minutes away.

537
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't remember which one you said.

538
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,500
Is that person supposed to detain somebody?

539
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,500
What is supposed to happen there?

540
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Remember, this is a comment that River is bringing up about if that possibility could occur.

541
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:26,000
In other words, somebody has dropped a dime and told the cop to come up there because there's somebody looking suspicious or something is tromping around in the woods.

542
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Because I'm pretty sure that these Border Patrol guys, if they're anywhere, they're in the swath.

543
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,500
That's not the case I'm talking about.

544
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:47,000
45 minutes, within 45 minutes to get a cop up there, whoever that person is that's trespassing is gone.

545
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Anyways.

546
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Probably gone.

547
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Right.

548
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Or do we expect some landowner to shoot him in the head?

549
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,500
What is supposed to happen?

550
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,500
What is the thing that's supposed to happen in that 45 minutes?

551
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:21,000
You're bringing up a good question because I'm sitting here trying to follow myself because I do own a square mile and I do have it posted.

552
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Okay.

553
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
posted.

554
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,500
And the idea that I have it posted is because I'm serious about what I don't want.

555
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,000
I don't want dirt bikes and snowmobile.

556
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Snowmobile problem.

557
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So I have my property posted.

558
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:56,000
What I'm just finding out is that some people could not get the benefit that I get, which is this current use credit that really is almost everything.

559
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I mean, I literally pay nothing.

560
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:13,500
So I guess to me, the issue here is that this whole idea of trafficking of people or people coming across the board is somewhat of a red herring.

561
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:27,000
To me, this bill really, in my mind, is about how we want to ensure that landowners who post their land don't lose out on that benefit.

562
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And that's why at this point, I'm just assumed vote for this to allow it on because it did pass the House.

563
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Like you say, the chairman Roy said it was going to pass.

564
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's attached to a bill that we know has been problematic and probably will die anyways.

565
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But at this point, I just think this whole issue about – last I heard, they only said like 19 people have come across the border.

566
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:15,500
Now, I know that you say there's 7,000 interactions, but that is, to me, people coming across the border, coming down.

567
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,000
That is the least of my worries here in New Hampshire.

568
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I just – I mean I know maybe the governor or maybe other people are worried about it, but it's such a long way to get down from that border, let alone the Canadian side just to get down there.

569
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So I just – I'm more interested in making sure that these people don't lose out on their tax credit.

570
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,500
I absolutely agree with that.

571
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
No problem.

572
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Got that.

573
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Great.

574
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Great.

575
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:10,500
I am concerned about what is your thought about, let's say you found somebody trespassing on your property.

576
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:17,000
You call the police, but you live someplace close where there's a policeman.

577
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
What do they do up north?

578
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,500
I assume they call the Pittsburgh police.

579
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,000
Do they capture and put them in a garage?

580
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
What do they do?

581
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Well, I mean, is Pittsburgh 3,000?

582
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Otherwise, you'd call a state trooper.

583
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And you just wait 45 minutes and hope the guy stays around.

584
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,500
This bill won't change that.

585
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,500
That's all I want to know.

586
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,000
That bill doesn't do anything to that.

587
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That's not changing.

588
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Exactly.

589
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:15,500
You would have an opportunity to detain somebody that was suspected of crossing the border illegally before trespassing and still allow an owner to post his or her land for those six activities and retain their discount so i'm okay with.

590
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,500
You really want to be replaced?

591
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Yeah, I do.

592
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,000
Chris, how do you feel about this?

593
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,500
You live on the North.

594
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Okay.

595
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Really need to you haven't been to this.

596
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
You want to reply?

597
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:56,000
How do you feel about this amendment all of it that much okay well one's for it the other one's against it okay well it doesn't matter if we're going to replace it doesn't you know it could be anybody okay but Okay.

598
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,500
But you really want to be replaced.

599
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
I'm concerned about profile.

600
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Okay.

601
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,500
I know you've expressed that before and other issues and.

602
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
And that's fine.

603
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,000
You're entitled to your opinion.

604
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Okay.

605
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
All right.

606
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,500
Is there some way we can work this out?

607
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Can we talk for a second?

608
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Okay, let's go to my office.

609
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
John, I will.

610
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
John.

611
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Thank you.

612
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Thank you.

613
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Thank you.

614
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,000
So we have a full contingent, right?

615
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
All right.

616
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So I'll make a motion to the house will accede to the Senate position.

617
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
All those in favor, please raise their hand.

618
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
One, two, three, four.

619
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Wait a minute.

620
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
What is the motion?

621
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Pass it.

622
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,500
We're going to pass this.

623
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Cede.

624
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Just pass it.

625
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Okay.

626
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Five.

627
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Those opposed?

628
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
One, two.

629
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Okay.

630
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
There we are.

631
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:27,000
obviously, for this bill to go further, it will have require some replacements.

632
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,500
Okay, that will end the committee conference on House Bill 1018.

633
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Thank you.

634
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Thank you.

635
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,500
Thank you.

636
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Thank you.

637
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Thank you.

638
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
All right.

639
00:58:44,500 --> 00:59:03,000
all right um we'll let's see how we're gonna handle this one okay why don't we start with the conversation about the uh ticket resellers which is um what's uh what section in the bill okay Okay.

640
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,500
So, Senator Shanley brought this board and it meant overwhelming support.

641
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
It was 20.0.

642
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,500
That's not total.

643
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:22,500
In our state, we've had a lot of problems, especially with the smaller theater venues, with people abusing ticket sales.

644
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:29,000
They go to a site, like the Palace Theater test extends the problem.

645
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,500
And people have minutes of AI-looking sites that looks like you're buying from the palace.

646
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:43,000
You think you're taking your granddaughter to Snow White and, oh, who's big?

647
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Taylor Swift, somebody.

648
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:55,500
And you're going there for your Taylor Swift ticket, you can see 160 and think, well, that won't be the price.

649
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm going to go front and center.

650
00:59:59,000 --> 01:02:08,500
Then you go to the palace theater and they've sold you tickets that, A, they didn't have, B, b don't exist and so people are getting ripped off left and right in new hampshire at all types of venues so down to shamley has been championing this building for several years and so i do appreciate her stance on the bill and think that it's time we do something about it i do realize the difficulty of getting out of state people or people from other countries who have these sites but i would at least appreciate our trying to go after people who are violating these laws in state because the palace theater has had hundreds of people show up with tickets that don't exist or were sold and people who paid quadruple the face value when there were other tickets for sale because they think they went to the actual site and they have in fact been at a artificial site so we would like john for this to go through i if if at all possible i do understand you're saying how are we going to get people in Singapore who have fake sites but because we have a limited opportunity to get people out of state I do appreciate it but at least we could get the ones who are operating in state as a start would be our position do you have anything else to say thank you um I just note that this section starts on page 33 line 17 at section 6.

651
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:36,000
if you're looking for it it comes after the long money transmitter piece so page so i'm not saying this 33 dying the sword for this but i don't think it would be a bad thing i think it would be in fact a good thing if we put this along with this other legislation.

652
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I have a question on that.

653
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yep.

654
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Go ahead.

655
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:55,500
Ken, could you remind me, is there been money allocated to follow up on people who are breaking this law in New Hampshire for enforcement?

656
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Or is it needed?

657
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:26,000
So, um, House Bill 2 funded a cyber security unit in the Consumer Protection Bureau starting this July 1st by letting them keep um an extra i think 500 000 a year to hire an attorney an investigator and a paralegal so there will be resources for cyber crimes um starting starting July 1st of this year.

658
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So, Mr.

659
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,500
chair, if if your body would favor.

660
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,500
Would like to keep it in.

661
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Yeah.

662
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Yeah.

663
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:47,000
And if so, if you could pull your members and see if they like this or not.

664
01:03:47,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Well, let's get all the issues on the table and then we'll have our discussion okay so um we actually had a very similar bill in the committee and um and we we did not pass it uh and the concern was that actually it was ironic remember representative gives who pointed out that this might happen sometimes on tickets Calvary but that really happens a lot on hotels that you know bookings.com people always seem to hit the wrong wrong page and and uh so it's obviously um this is this is not not just limited to ticket resales.

665
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,500
This is a huge problem in anything that people may desire that's on the Internet.

666
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:53,000
So in terms of how far are we going to go and what we're going to expect.

667
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,500
When I first got the bill, I immediately pulled up on my computer at the Palace Theater.

668
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,500
I typed in the Palace Theater.

669
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:11,500
And the very first link was, I don't know, I don't remember the name.

670
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,500
It was some ticket.

671
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,500
And so then I'm taking the language of this bill.

672
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,500
And looking at their web page.

673
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,500
And marvelous lead that they were actually already in compliance.

674
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,000
And what the, they started out with.

675
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:41,500
Okay, so no, they don't have the classic palace theater logo, which looks sort of like a little, I guess it's the marquee.

676
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:53,000
And they don't have the marquee, but they did is they have the marquee, but they cut off the bottom of the picture.

677
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,500
So it just says PLA, you see, and then they stopped.

678
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:18,000
And then then you go through and then they definitely identify and say that they were not affiliated with any theater, that they are here to provide a service to you to buy the ticket so that that disclosure.

679
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,500
So all those other issues, it seemed like they were right.

680
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:30,500
So then I said, well, let's go pick a seat and let's compare pricing.

681
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:36,500
And sure enough, this webpage, the pricing was definitely higher, almost double.

682
01:06:36,500 --> 01:07:13,000
But you know what really got me was how did they know that J2 through five or j1 through four were available are they updating their web page or how they're doing it or how is it that this reseller knows this information and uh i mean how could they do live or on and then i know that that was some of the concern we had heard about the issue going forward.

683
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,500
They sell you the ticket and then they go buy it.

684
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Then they go.

685
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,000
But that's what we had heard back.

686
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That's what we had heard the last time.

687
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,500
So maybe that was true.

688
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:39,500
But they would seem to have the ones that were sold on the other page did have it.

689
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,000
So they must update it.

690
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I mean, it's obviously there's a lot of people spending a lot of time and effort making this to work.

691
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:05,500
But at the end of the day, it's, you know, this is the reason why I believe the committee killed it was it was a buyer beware.

692
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:14,000
The buyer needs to know that you've got to go to the right webpage to get something.

693
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Okay.

694
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So we just found that we had a lot of people who come to us say they've done this, especially with this Palace Theater.

695
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,500
There are other Thank you.

696
01:08:30,500 --> 01:09:27,000
the right web page to get something okay so we just found it we had a lot of people who come to us say they've done this especially with this palace theater there are other places also right so i realize that this is a big net you talked about out of country people we wouldn't be able to reach them and stuff i do see those so there's a net here we're not going to catch everybody but um as a famous politician said who was sitting here momentarily right don't look He always said, do not – yeah, don't let the – The perfect be – yes, I've heard the expression.

697
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The perfect be the enemy of the good.

698
01:09:31,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Right, but in my case, I don't like passing, let's say, to feel good, it's on the books, and people are going to be greatly disappointed that – because at the end of the day, act was written the purpose of the consumer protection act was to protect consumers from in-state businesses that um that do not refund people's money that that was the purpose of it and so to have the state you know the attorney general's office worrying about you know live nation all over you know whenever and all these all of these ticket issues um it seems like it would be a wild goose chase and and also a real waste of resources for what we right now the attorney general consumer protection is pretty stretched i understand I'm not too excited.

699
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,500
I knew where we were Protection is pretty stretched.

700
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
I understand your position.

701
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,500
I'm not too excited about that.

702
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:54,000
I knew where we were going when we started with this.

703
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
All right.

704
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So that is Section 6 of the bill.

705
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
All right.

706
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
The next issue is Section 7 and 8, I believe, and 9.

707
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:26,500
Is that also eight seven eight nine is that is that right ryan seven eight nine it would be your if you go farther seven eight nine and ten okay I am I am on page 34.

708
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
That starts on page.

709
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,000
Yeah, that's the wrong 1.

710
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I did.

711
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,500
I just give you the new 1.

712
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
that's that's 1.

713
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,500
I want to look at one that says Senate on the top.

714
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
Okay, here's 1.

715
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Okay, so.

716
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:59,000
As a co sponsor of this legislation, I certainly wanted to give at least some stab at trying to survive it.

717
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
This is the 1.

718
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:28,000
represent grassy who sits on yeah the committee and the issue was um the i'm getting these um basically this is an investment feature for cities towns and counties and that um they invest it and um it was kind of annoying to some people that they don't put money in New Hampshire banks.

719
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You know, this is to him, you know, cities and towns, why wouldn't they want to?

720
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Well, I guess they get higher interest rates.

721
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,500
With say, so the amendment that we've just been passed around.

722
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Is simply to to take out the offending language, which was maintain no less than 30%.

723
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:59,000
We would delete that and just make it a feel good.

724
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:25,000
statement committee shall strive to okay okay so that this amendment as you see here where you see the the 30 we're just crossing that out okay very much there you go i think it's uh holding back and i i've got a couple letters on this yeah put your mic on.

725
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I've gotten a couple of letters on this.

726
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yeah.

727
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Put your mic on.

728
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yeah.

729
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,500
I have gotten a couple of letters on this.

730
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:56,000
I just talked to Dave Caron from Dairy, who's the – and he said that on average, there's about a 50 basis point difference between what PDIP is offering and what banks are.

731
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,500
It ranges anywhere from 75 basis points down to 15, but that's what he's saying.

732
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:14,000
A study came out by Brian Gottlieb, who just made a few phone calls and determined that that's not the case.

733
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Ouch.

734
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,500
I'm sure his research was a little more than a few phone calls.

735
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:41,000
And what I'm also assured of is that on the PDIP website, they mentioned that there is risk involved, which I think that should be said because I think it is more risky than a Fed-backed CD.

736
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,500
But I think that's okay.

737
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:49,000
I think for an extra 50 basis points, it's worth it.

738
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Right.

739
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:00,500
So in this case, all we're saying is that PDAP at least consider the bank and just consider it.

740
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,500
That's all it is.

741
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:07,000
It's feel good now, just at least consider it.

742
01:15:07,000 --> 01:16:13,500
And it's under review by the state treasurer anyways and anyways so uh I think there's uh a lot of uh good strong feelings about it and we don't need this language okay so you're okay with this amendment yes okay are you guys okay with this amendment we'll be okay personally I'm not because I don't think if you put any number to strive for it's just feel good legislation which you usually don't like you're usually saying why am i going to pass feel good legislation and i feel like we're doing that right now but that's okay we're in the committee conference and so so it's fine we're feeling so good and i feel like it gives the state treasurer more nimbleness to be able to react to market conditions.

743
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:26,000
If things change and the manager wants to put more or less money into banks, then the banks that have a presence in New Hampshire.

744
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,500
And you referenced the statute.

745
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
I passed it out.

746
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,000
It's 6-8 Roman 1 and Roman 1A.

747
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:50,500
It's basically federal banks, banks that are chartered here and banks chartered in another state that have a presence here and engage in lending activity in state to the extent they have deposits.

748
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,500
So to me, it's an economic stimulus piece.

749
01:16:54,500 --> 01:17:01,500
And I think this is a real compromise from where the Senate started out.

750
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,000
And I'm a middle child.

751
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,500
So I don't fear compromise.

752
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,000
You'd be surprised how many middle childs are politicians.

753
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
We make better legislators, but personally I'm paid.

754
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I'm the youngest.

755
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,500
I just want my way.

756
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
There you go.

757
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
But we're fine.

758
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,500
But I appreciate your work on this, Mr.

759
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Chairman.

760
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Okay.

761
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:46,000
Okay, so we haven't really caucused, but I mean, I feel like if we pass the underlying bill, we delete out the ticket reselling section and pass this amendment.

762
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,500
Okay, everybody okay for that?

763
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,500
Okay.

764
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,500
Okay.

765
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,500
Okay.

766
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,500
So all those to a seed to this Senate position.

767
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:07,000
With amendments to remove section, what did I call say section 6 that I say.

768
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No, wait a minute.

769
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Uh, wait a minute.

770
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
The section.

771
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
No, that.

772
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,500
say section 6 did i say from page 34.

773
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:30,000
no wait a minute uh wait a minute the yeah section no that where am i yeah section 6 on 33.

774
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and amend uh And amend section investment advisor.

775
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That's 2A.

776
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So amend section 8.

777
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,500
And for those of you falling at home, is that correct?

778
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Okay, that's my motion.

779
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,500
All those in favor say aye.

780
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
Aye.

781
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
All those opposed.

782
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,500
So moved unanimously.

783
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500

01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,000
This is the fund currently.

806
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It was established in 2016 with 276 million in settlement funds from Exxon Mobil.

807
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
From what?

808
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Exxon Mobil.

809
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Okay.

810
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Thank you.

811
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Thank you.

812
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Well, we don't have language, but we can – I think we have an idea of what we're talking about now, is that the Senate – we have to accede to the House position, but with another amendment, and the language of that amendment was what was passed in House Bill – What was the number?

813
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
House Bill 393.

814
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:41,500
Okay, so basically the House Finance did pass the bill, 393, with only the money for the study, which was only $2 million.

815
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
For the engineering.

816
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,500
For the engineering, $2 million for the engineering.

817
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
$4.5 million, I believe.

818
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,500
$6.5 million altogether.

819
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Okay.

820
01:20:53,500 --> 01:21:00,000
So, we are going to take what the House passed out of finance.

821
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
$6.5 million.

822
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That's the $6.5 million.

823
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,500
And we're going to add that to – that's already done.

824
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Right.

825
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
It's already passed.

826
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
Yes.

827
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Yes.

828
01:21:17,500 --> 01:22:16,000
So, it's already passed so you're just a cd to the house position and we're done we're just clarifying yes that's what we were even better that's what we just needed the moment to clarify one for us that you're cd to the house position that whole issue with the 25 million was dealt with it's all been dealt with in 393 perfect that's music my ears there'll be another bill next year for the remainder so all we need to focus on is the 1259 languages it came over from the house edition yes yes okay so i make a motion that we accede to the house position is the question clear all those in favor.

829
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Please say aye aye.

830
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Aye.

831
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Those opposed.

832
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,500
So moved unanimously and we're all set.

833
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Very good.

834
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
Well, thanks.

835
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm glad you were here.

836
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Donna.

837
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,500
I would have had to explain the whole thing.

838
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
Thank you.

839
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,500
Thank you.
