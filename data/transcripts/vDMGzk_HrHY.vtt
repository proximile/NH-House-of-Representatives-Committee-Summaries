um i was also appointed along with your
 
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
chairman to the
 
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.670 align:start position:0%
chairman to the
sysc

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
replacement and closure committee
 
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
where we looked into things
 
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee special committee
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
we went and visited the ag's office and
 
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 align:start position:0%
we spoke to
 
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.510 align:start position:0%
we spoke to
[Music]

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.469 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
senior ag that handles
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
civil procedure so if we get sued she
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
gets the cases
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then if we need to prosecute
 
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
somebody for poor behavior
 
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
senior ag was there and so we didn't
 
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
cross talk because they have kind of a
 
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
firewall between them
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
but as we talked about the kinds of
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
things that they thought we needed to
 
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.470 align:start position:0%
things that they thought we needed to
include

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.350 align:start position:0%
include
in

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
the replacement center
 
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
the replacement center
they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
they
both

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
civil procedure and criminal
 
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
pursuits were
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
both very confident that they needed
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
this bill that there isn't enough
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
storage of quality digital recordings
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
because as you can imagine if we need to
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
defend somebody
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
we want to have good video evidence and
 
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
audio evidence and then if you want to
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
prosecute one of our employees or
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
somebody else that's a visitor or guest
 
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
you'd still want the evidence so
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
if you had
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
mr goulet the commissioner for doit here
 
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start position:0%
and mr weeders who is the
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
cio for the department of health and
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
human services what they'd say is that
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
they already do this so you would get a
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of conflicting
 
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.869 align:start position:0%
little bit of conflicting
um

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and just just to deconflict it
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit they they currently are
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
recording and storing for two years and
 
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
so we wrote on
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh on line 11
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the retention of the data should be
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
a minimum length of time to
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that justice is served
 
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
make sure that justice is served
and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the financial analysis they assume
 
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
that that would be seven years because
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note with us so so in
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note you'll see 42 000
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
to build out the storage architecture to
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
to keep these images
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
for a longer period of time
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
the reason we didn't put seven years on
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
line 11 is because federal and state law
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
can change over time and it may be
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate to keep them 14 years or 20
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
years or or whatever so we we didn't
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
have to keep changing the laws
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
on line
 
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.790 align:start position:0%
on line
10

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
9 and 10 you'll see that the the
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
recordings have to capture
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the actions of one person and
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
interactions between two or more people
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't specify what kind of people
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
those are those could be uh
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
guests of the facility
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh it could be
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
our own employees and and so we had a
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist suggest to us
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we specifically call out and say
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
including law enforcement
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
and so if you hear that i just want to
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
tell you i i thought about that i just
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be redundant because
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know people are people i think
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
there's a 60 song about that
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
so we want them to maintain up time of
 
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
so we want them to maintain up time of
98

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
98
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
which is they don't currently have a
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
standard so this would establish
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
standard so
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
and with that madam chair thank you i'll
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
representative grossman
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
so be nice my my sisters are in the back
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
room so be
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
gentle to me
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming uh
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards to present this
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
who can access
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
the video you may have said that
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
but who
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
can access
 
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.830 align:start position:0%
can access
these

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
videos the
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
the act this bill doesn't specifically
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
refer to the access control
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned they
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
already have a system in place uh the
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
reliability and the length of time is
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
really kind of the issue between the
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
status quo and what we're proposing
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
so uh so i i didn't touch the access
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
control issues because i believe it's
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
already covered uh in the current system
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i do think
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
that you know there is a reference here
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
to requiring
 
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.629 align:start position:0%
to requiring
privacy

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
pursuant to federal and state laws or
 
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.150 align:start position:0%
pursuant to federal and state laws or
regulations

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't that's that's related to
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
the areas of control and not the
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
access to the images
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
so it's not complete i think if you
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to amend this to be more specific
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have any issue with that
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
but because i didn't pursue it i don't
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
know if it would be redundant with some
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions i i have
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
one further answer to give sure um
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
a bill that i think has excellent
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
prospects that will establish one within
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh a security and i.t governance
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee who will be responsible
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
for ensuring
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
privacy and they'll be doing it through
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
establishment of various policies for it
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
security and privacy
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
and if if the department doesn't already
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
have a specific access control privacy
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
to protect private uh
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
access control policy to protect privacy
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure that would be one of the
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
on that same line as the
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
retaining a minimum length of time as
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
justice may require
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about some provisions in the
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
rsa which is
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
get this information so that they can
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
put it in their court case
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
and is that um
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
the use of the recording um
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
in court cases is the main objective
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um of this bill and
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
and having that access so that they can
 
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
and having that access so that they can
um

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
um have proof of what what occurred in
 
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
um have proof of what what occurred in
that

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
situation so that they can
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
obtain justice from the judicial
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
branch is that um
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
my correct understanding of the kind of
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
thrust of this bill or you you know i i
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
representative

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
i uh i would say that depending on who
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
you talk to you'd get slightly different
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
answers when you say this the primary
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
purpose is for uh evidence for the court
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
cases you know there's two types there's
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
the civil procedure where we get sued
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
for damages then there's criminal
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
in case somebody's violated the law so
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
in either court
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
scenario this evidence would be
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
available and subject to just uh
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
available and subject to just uh
discovery

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
discovery
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think another person could come in and
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
say no no no the real reason that we do
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is because when people know that
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're being watched and there's
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
evidence they modify their behavior and
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
we pro it's a this is a prevention tool
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
as much as it is
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
as much as it is
uh

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0%
uh
evidentiary

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.790 align:start position:0%
uh representative
grossman

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
grossman
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
or representative long which one had
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
you called me representative grossman
 
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.949 align:start position:0%
you called me representative grossman
okay

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i had submitted a
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
a bill a few sessions ago for videos
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
audio and video surveillance in group
 
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
audio and video surveillance in group
homes

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
homes
and

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.829 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
a lot of
privacy

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
privacy
concerns

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
so in this bill
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
do you discuss
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
placement so where
 
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
placement so where
cameras

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.670 align:start position:0%
in terms of
privacy

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
of these kids
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
camera placement in terms of like
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
we we did common areas but this is a
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
different situation than a group home
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
was that discussed uh thank you for the
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
question i i okay i i would say that
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the video and audio recording in
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
detention centers is
 
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.150 align:start position:0%
detention centers is
um

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
um
an

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
industry in itself where there are
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
consultants that come in and and what
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would require them to do
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh particularly in a replacement
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
scenario where we build something new
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
is is to do an architectural review of
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
all of the angles to make sure that in
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
the hallways and the kitchens and the
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
dining rooms you know everywhere where
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
people can in the counseling rooms
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
probably they may want to turn off audio
 
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.190 align:start position:0%
probably they may want to turn off audio
but

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't know but but there will be uh
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sure consultants that are brought in
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
and and do a a map a mapping of the
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
facility that where you wouldn't put
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
in those places that are protected uh by
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
privacy law and federal state regulate
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and other regulations
 
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.069 align:start position:0%
and other regulations
um

00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
like such as a bathroom if somebody's
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
using the the facilities you're you're
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
just not going to record that um and
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
there there are probably other
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
exceptions that are exempt
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
all right oh and you mentioned group
 
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.990 align:start position:0%
all right oh and you mentioned group
homes

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.269 align:start position:0%
if you look
at

00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
it reads each facility paid for in whole
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
or in part with general funds and used
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement county sheriffs or
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
state police
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
so that certainly would include the
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
sununu center but it would not
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
probably include group homes so your
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
bill is not redundant it would be
 
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:22.150 align:start position:0%
bill is not redundant it would be
complementary

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
do you have any follow-ups okay
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question so
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
each back to line four
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
a secure out-of-state placement would we
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
we would require
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
um videoing
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative i i would i my answer to
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
that and again i'm not an attorney is uh
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
that this is new hampshire law and would
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
govern all facilities in new hampshire i
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
think your question refers to whether or
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
not we contract out support to
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-state locations and i don't think
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
they'd be covered by this law
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
but this law might inform the
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
contracting process where we would have
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with vermont or maine or
 
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with vermont or maine or
whatever

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
this would probably uh
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
want to be a requirement but this
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill would not require our
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
putting it into contract language and i
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
so what i think you've done is i think
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
you've discovered a possible hole
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
that that maybe
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment could fill
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up for me so so your your
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
your bill is
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire only yeah okay uh and
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
then the other follow-up if i may
 
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:56.949 align:start position:0%
then the other follow-up if i may
um

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say who pays for the videoing
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
so like let's say that nashua is
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
children home there's somebody being
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
detained there
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
um they're in new hampshire they're
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're we're required for video
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
who pays would would the state be
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying state facilities
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
putting the videos in
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the private entity were contracted
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
with would be responsible would that
 
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:25.830 align:start position:0%
would be a requirement of the contract
 
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.509 align:start position:0%
would be a requirement of the contract
[Music]

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay so there there's a clear bright
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
line i think in this of what we pay for
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
the uh what we wouldn't pay for is is
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
not in this bill so so the group homes
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before i think the group
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
homes would be outside of this bill and
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the other bill being represented or
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
presented by the representative could be
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
complementary to this but this is just
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
would have to be used to pay for the
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
sununu centers for example and anywhere
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
it also said anywhere where we want to
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
securely detain miners
 
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.670 align:start position:0%
securely detain miners
so

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that as a routine
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
practice we
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state securely detains minors at
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
group homes i i don't think we do that
 
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
group homes i i don't think we do that
okay

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh very good thank you
 
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh very good thank you
okay

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative desamond
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
considering some of the other questions
 
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.629 align:start position:0%
considering some of the other questions
i'm

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
trying to answer them in my own head
 
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.389 align:start position:0%
trying to answer them in my own head
and

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
line four it says each facility paid for
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
also

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
therefore include
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
outsourced to another state and that
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
facility has
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
video cameras in it wouldn't that
 
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.150 align:start position:0%
video cameras in it wouldn't that
protect

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
in allowing those facilities to use
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
those cameras as we would
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
since we paid those facilities
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
yeah you're taking care of our youth
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
you're

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
you guys are on to an excellent edge
 
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.269 align:start position:0%
you guys are on to an excellent edge
case

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
scenario that i did not anticipate
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
i've i've always conceived this to be
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire controlled facilities
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
but the way that sentence reads and i
 
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.069 align:start position:0%
but the way that sentence reads and i
i'll

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'll be a weasel and say that i had ols
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
help me with the drafting so
 
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.670 align:start position:0%
help me with the drafting so
uh

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
i i just didn't work through the
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
scenario in my head when we contracted
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
out and maybe i know mr ribson
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
representing dcyf is coming up so maybe
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
he could tell us what he thinks i think
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
it would be smart contracting to make it
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
a requirement but
 
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
a requirement but
um

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i'd i'd like to take sort of an
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
another opportunity while i'm talking
 
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.870 align:start position:0%
another opportunity while i'm talking
anyways

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
is uh i did not include body cameras
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
they haven't used body cameras there
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't a request for body cameras by the
 
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
wasn't a request for body cameras by the
ag

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
ag
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
um and so it it's silent on body cameras
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
what this committee would want to do
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
about that i
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'd say take a baby step and just make
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure we got the
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you so much
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna ask director ripson to
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
come up and maybe address some of these
 
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
come up and maybe address some of these
questions

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
joe ripson director dcyf thank you for
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh hearing me today good to see
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
everybody this morning yes we're not we
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
didn't officially take a position on
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here primarily just to provide
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
information but i heard some questions
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
brought up last time that might be
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
helpful for me to provide some
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
information on um so a couple things
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently sysc is the only facility in
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
the entire state of new hampshire or
 
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
the entire state of new hampshire or
anywhere

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the country that takes detained and
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
committed kids from new hampshire
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are no detained and committed kids
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
in private facilities there are no
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
detained committed kids in other states
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
there are kids who are in residential
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
programs for other purposes but they've
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
not been detained or committed by the
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
court or they've been maybe released on
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
parole or what's called administratively
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
released that's when we determine that a
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
child but needs are best suited in a
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
residential program rather than in sysc
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the questions about this applying to
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
other settings really don't apply to
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
today's state of course there's
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
conversations around the future of
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment in new
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and should that future look
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
different that answer would be different
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
two in terms of what we already record
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
about two and a half years ago when
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
when we started hearing about this
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
litigation coming forward we took a look
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
at the existing video surveillance
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
system within sysc and found that it
 
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.630 align:start position:0%
system within sysc and found that it
wasn't

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
up to where we wanted it to be the
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
quality was low the camera placement was
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
not capturing everything we wanted to
 
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
not capturing everything we wanted to
capture

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
capture
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
and the department made a significant
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
investment in putting in a new very high
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
quality camera system which captures
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
everything in the building everything on
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
the perimeter of the building
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
except for
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
most bedrooms and i say most because
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are a couple that have cameras for
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
when a young person is on a suicide
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
watch so that we can watch that
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and that is allowable under federal and
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um bathrooms uh most of the
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
bathrooms that's why i see are
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
single-use bathrooms single-use showers
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
um if a child is on something like in
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
those instances of a child's own some
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
type of watch status where we're worried
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
about them trying to harm themselves the
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
staff actually will go in with them
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
which i know is not a comfortable
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
thought but we have to make sure that
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
we're safe for kids but we don't record
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
inside of there
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i think those are the basic two
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions that came up i'm happy to
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
answer others if people have or go
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
um can you talk a little bit about
 
00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:33.510 align:start position:0%
um can you talk a little bit about
storage

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently
 
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently
um

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the video storage so currently i think
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
it's around two years worth of storage
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
but actually
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
up until
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
when a litigation hold was put into
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
place it wasn't even kept for that long
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
it was only kept if there was an
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
incident and then it would be held now
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
the problem with the standard like that
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes somebody brings up an
 
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.270 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes somebody brings up an
allegation

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
allegation
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
later than we realize and then that
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
video would have been gone
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
so at this point at this exact moment
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
because there's a litigation hold
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
nothing is being destroyed or eliminated
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
but i do think changing to a system
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
where it's held i think the reason the
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
department assumed seven years was
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
because that's i believe the statute of
 
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.909 align:start position:0%
because that's i believe the statute of
limitations

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
moving to a point where you hold this
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
video for a longer period of time
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
ripson um
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay with respect to uh detained and
 
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
okay with respect to uh detained and
committed

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's no scenario with respect to a
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
mental health facility or
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
a substance use facility where somebody
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
would be detained or committed not for
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of detention and commitment
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
now if the court orders detention and
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
commitment that's a separate standard
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the only place where they would go
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
is sysc right now
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
lots of kids go to programs like that
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
but that's based on treatment needs and
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
based on an identified you know need to
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
have a child reside in some place to
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
have their you know their needs met
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up with do you think that
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
that should be specified in the bill
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
as i it's clear to me as you know the
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
person who does this the way that it's
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
written because it talks about applying
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
to facilities for detention and
 
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.390 align:start position:0%
to facilities for detention and
commitment

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
which to me reads it's only sysc today
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
but it leaves room that if in a future
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
state some other facilities identified
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
for detention and commitment that this
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
would apply to that facility
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
so i think for my purposes it makes
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
sense but i can understand people who
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the same exposure to this
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
work that i do on a day-to-day basis
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
might not might not follow that the same
 
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
might not might not follow that the same
way

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.470 align:start position:0%
way
okay

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.270 align:start position:0%
uh and then
uh

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
the follow-up i make
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
with respect to um with
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
respect to out of state are you in
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
we should just concentrate on the state
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire right now i think given
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the only facility that's used is in
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire um i think
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's the right place to put our focus
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
you know during the committee process
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
around the replacement and closure of
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
sysc there was a lot of discussion
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
around the importance of making sure
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
that kids stay as local as possible to
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
their communities because
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
when kids go to sysc it's very
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
infrequent that they're there for very
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
long they're going to reintegrate with
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
their families they're going to
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
reintegrate with their communities and
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
having long distances makes that harder
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair as a follow-up to
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
my prior question concerning storage do
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
you feel that it would be necessary
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
for your department to specify in the
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
law the seven years
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think so i think the way
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
that we read it was was that you know
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's as necessary for you know you know
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
litigation criminal justice all those
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
types of purposes i don't remember the
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
exact language in here but that's how we
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
read it and that's how we got to the
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
seven years so if at some point the
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
statute of limitation changed or
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
something like that we would be able to
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
ex change the the time period that the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
records would be retained thank you very
 
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.070 align:start position:0%
records would be retained thank you very
much

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you so much
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
for the information thank you okay so
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the public hearing on
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1614 and we'll be back at 10 30 for
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open the public hearing
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
on 1612 and i will call up rep james

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
i bring forward hb 1612
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
fn as an attempt to stop the abuse of
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
allow limited and crucial dcyf resources
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be invested in true cases where
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
children are in danger
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
and to allow the state to apply
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
penalties to those who make malicious
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
and intentional false complaints
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
i do not know if the system has become
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
more weaponized and abused lately or if
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
i have only come to notice it through my
 
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
i have only come to notice it through my
constituents

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
but what i once thought was an
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
occasional false complaint made with
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
knowingly malicious intent has become
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
more commonplace
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to say i hear it most often
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
with regards to divorces where one party
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
is having friends love interests or
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
family make anonymous complaints against
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
the other party
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
to gain some perceived advantage in
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
court regarding custody
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
i know of one person right now who's
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
been in the divorce process for three
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
years with four young children
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
and who has had six separate complaints
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
filed by the new love interest of their
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
former partner
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's for that reason that i include the
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
ability for the court to appoint a
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem to be able to
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
recognize a pattern of malicious and
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
abusive complaints being made
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
in any situation where there's custody
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
involved a divorce situation
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
the bill does not remove the protections
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i repeat does not remove the
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
protections that are afforded to those
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
making a complaint in any way
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
it changes the concept of anonymous
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
reports to one of confidential reports
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
to any of you
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
who have friends or relatives in the
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
police force you'll recognize that the
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to confidential
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
informants is extremely strong
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of you probably recognize the
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to juvenile records
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
protections in this case are just as
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
strong as it would take an absolute
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
proof of malicious and harmful intent to
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
unmask any identity of anyone who makes
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
a complaint
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
for that reason i don't think that this
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill would ever affect a first-time
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
complainer it would have to show a
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
pattern of false complaints before that
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
person becomes unmasked to try to find
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
out who's making the false complaints
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
as such this bill will mainly target
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
those repeat abusers of the system
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
where the pattern of definitive
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
malicious and harmful intent can be
 
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
malicious and harmful intent can be
proven

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
proven
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
finally the bill provides for penalties
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
after someone has been proven to have
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
made malicious and deliberately harmful
 
00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.269 align:start position:0%
made malicious and deliberately harmful
complaints

00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
i have a handout from the united states
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
bureau the children's bureau
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
which is located at childwelfare.gov
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
and it shows the landscape across all 50
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
states and puerto rico for both failing
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
to report and for falsely reporting
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
29 states and puerto rico all have
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
penalties in place in varying forms and
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
amounts to address false reports new
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire has none
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
the closest we have in new hampshire is
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
filing a false police report but a
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
report made directly to dcyf is not
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
technically a filed police report so
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
court action is doubtful
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
the state would not be able to reach the
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
burden of proof on that that it was a
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
filed police false police report and
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's no law saying they can't make a
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
false report to dcyf
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
in addition when complaints may be taken
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
completely anonymously there's no way to
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
identified a repeated abuser even should
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
a pattern be recognized
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and every time a false report is made
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
even when there's a pattern of false
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
reports dcyf has no other option but to
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
fully investigate the report
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
that takes valuable resources away from
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
other cases and we end up with
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
situations like we have with missing
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
child harmony montgomery
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
i will give you uh the handout that i
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to the secretary so you can all get
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
copies i didn't have time to make copies
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
for everyone this morning and it's a
 
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.349 align:start position:0%
for everyone this morning and it's a
pretty

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
thick report
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
but i ask you to support hb 1612 fn and
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
to help deter malicious and harmful
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
false reports in new hampshire while
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
allowing dcyf to focus their very
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
crucial resources on the cases where
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
children are in actual danger and not
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
being used as collateral pawns by
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
selfish adults
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll take questions if you
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i have one yes ma'am so who pays for
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
the gal if the parents can't afford to
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
pay for the gal
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
well if the parents can't afford it i
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
think if you're aware with with the
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
court they usually assign the the cost
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the gal to one parent or the other
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
based on whoever's more financially able
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
to do it or sometimes they split it uh
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
if neither parent was able to pay for it
 
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
if neither parent was able to pay for it
and

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh the court
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
again it's an option the court can
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
appoint it it's not saying the court
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
must appoint it
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
so the judge and his wisdom would be
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
able to decide
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether one's necessary
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
and if one was necessary for the
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
protection of one parent one would hope
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
that that parent found a means to pay
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
for the gal and if not i imagine it
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
would probably fall in a state
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware that in the bill it says
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
shall not may
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be a may and i missed
 
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be a may and i missed
that

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair uh thank you
 
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.310 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair uh thank you
representative

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
now this this uh these reports just um
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
refer to neglect and abuse
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.470 align:start position:0%
okay so
uh

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up if i may
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh so with respect to a casa or
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
appointment that's that's at no cost
 
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.069 align:start position:0%
appointment that's that's at no cost
correct

00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
i imagine that i believe that casas are
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
at no cost right okay
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh and is there
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
to follow up certainly is there a point
 
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.150 align:start position:0%
to follow up certainly is there a point
where

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
we start to realize that it's being
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
malicious i mean is it two times is it
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
three times is it four times i think
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the experts at dcyf would be able
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
to recognize the pattern better than i
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
would um i can definitely say that six
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
times i think you've already established
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
a pattern when they've had to
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
investigate six times to find nothing
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
and they're still getting calls um
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes it might be two times i doubt
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
that any first time call would ever
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
establish a pattern it's one time
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
and uh follow us one if i may thank you
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh and this is
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
this is not only for
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
parties involved this could be a
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law or a grandfather
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have seen this weaponized against
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
political officials when somebody didn't
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
like what they were doing i've even
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
heard of it being used by a neighbor who
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
was disgruntled about the way that their
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors were behaving and made a call
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
into dcyf anonymously it's being
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
weaponized more and more
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
but as i said in my testimony
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that pattern always
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
existed and i'm just noticing it more or
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
if it's become an aspect of social media
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the the spread of people deciding
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they can try to get the other
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
person by using the state against them
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.349 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
subjects i guess one of them is um in in
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings you should have a
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
guardian item and the other one is
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
um if you're making false reports there
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be something
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
that a rule that you're breaking is
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
there a connection that i'm missing
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
between the two or is
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
is one of them if if let's say for
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
example we did not agree that you should
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
always have to have a guardium at
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
lightham could we still keep
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
um having punishments for making false
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
reports to dcyf and it and it still
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
stand on its own kind of a thing i see
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
where your question's going and yes it
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
does stand on its own i only added the
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem as a
 
00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:15.190 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem as a
um

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
disconnected third party to recognize
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the pattern of abuse
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
and if that was something that
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
because the guardian ad litem if if
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're in a divorce situation which is
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
where i think it happens most often uh
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
my thought and and the
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
answers i got from some people that i
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
talked to was that the guardian ad litem
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
if the court decided to appoint one
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to see having known the
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
children and interviewed them that these
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
reports had a false malicious intent to
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
them and be able to end on a sooner wait
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
not rather than waiting for six
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
complaints they'd be able to see after
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
the second one or the third one that
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
this is bogus
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and be able to say we need to put a stop
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
to these false complaints and get on
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
with the the
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
case in in court
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
for the divorce
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
so it's it's related via the the false
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
complaint being made
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
and as i said only one part of it is the
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
divorce situation where the complaints
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
are made there are a lot of reports made
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's that yeah no no follow-up yeah
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
yeah um so
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking this follow-up
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the um language
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh regarding guardian items is only
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
in divorce proceedings it specifically
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
states correct
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings and
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
it would be in cases that are brought
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter so
 
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.829 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter so
um

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
in my reading of it the dcyf would have
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
to make a judgment on whether or not
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
something was um
 
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.309 align:start position:0%
something was um
malicious

00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
malicious
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
and then they would
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
recommend that charges be filed and then
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
when the charges were filed the case
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
would exist before that the case doesn't
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
really exist and then
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
they would um
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the gal would do the research for the
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
court to find out whether or not this um
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes possible if
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
the complaints are made and there's
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
currently a co-existing
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
situation for custody which could be
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
inside or outside of a divorce
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding but if there's children
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
involved in a custody situation and the
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
complaints are being made to try to
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
influence that then the gal
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
could once the determination was made by
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
dcyf that there was a pattern of abuse
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
here and they want to unmask the person
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and have the gal look at it they could
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
have the gl gal look into it before they
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
decide to unmask the person
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
and and decide who's actually making
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
those anonymous complaints the gal could
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
look into it and see is this truly
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
malicious are the children being harmed
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
more by the complaints
 
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
more by the complaints
than

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
the situation that they're living in
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
because children are harmed by the false
 
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
because children are harmed by the false
complaints

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%

is drafted um i do appreciate the the
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
the issue that um
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor brought forward as
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
being one that
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
that is worthy of the state thinking
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
about um we do see situations where
 
00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
about um we do see situations where
people's

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
people's
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to weaponize the child
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
protection system in private custodial
 
00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.829 align:start position:0%
protection system in private custodial
matters

00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're divorces sometimes
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
they're not divorces but we do see it
 
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:04.069 align:start position:0%
they're not divorces but we do see it
happen

00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
we also do see situations where we
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
believe people are making complaints
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
unwarranted but nevertheless trigger an
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
investigation because
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
for us if we get an allegation
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
that if proven true would be abuse or
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
neglect we must screen it in we must
 
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
neglect we must screen it in we must
investigate

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:20.950 align:start position:0%
investigate
um

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
which means some people who know how to
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
make craft allegations could make false
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
allegations and trigger an investigation
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
even if it's something that's not
 
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
even if it's something that's not
warranted

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
warranted
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
and we would think it would be somewhat
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
of a dangerous position for us not to
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
follow up on something like that
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
so i understand the intent of this and i
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
think this is actually a space where
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
folks could
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
could come to some solutions to try to
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
improve that aspect of the system it
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
does waste resources it has folks
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
digging into problems that aren't really
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
problems and it is bad for kids and
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
families to have them scared of the
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
child protection system unnecessarily
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the same time my biggest concern with
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is the elimination of
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
while i understand the intent here is to
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that people aren't making
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
false reports and to be able to identify
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
who are making repeated reports we often
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
get anonymous reports that are warranted
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
that are founded
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and while i would prefer and we ask
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
everybody who calls to identify
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
themselves and tell them that we'll keep
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
their name confidential unless told by a
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
court that we have to share it and that
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
does happen sometimes
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of people still choose to report
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
anonymously and i can't imagine a
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
situation where we get a call you know
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
some of these are pretty horrific calls
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
right somebody's a victim of domestic
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
violence there's something horrible
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
happening to their child they're afraid
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
to identify themselves
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i can't imagine getting that call
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the caller this the screener on our
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
side saying sorry you won't tell me your
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
name so we're not going to go out and
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
look at this um it's just it's not
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
something that i think is
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
good for kids i think we have to come up
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
with ways to
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
address that issue without completely
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
eliminating anonymous reporting
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the first part right the
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
part around the appointment of a gal i
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
think there's lots of practical
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
implications that the committee's tapped
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
onto that need to be figured out i don't
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad idea having an
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
independent person look
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
in custodial disputes and divorces
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
especially where it looks like the child
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
protection system is being weaponized
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
but figuring out how to do that is
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
is complicated who's going to pay for it
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
i would say um i'd want to be very
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
careful that dcyf doesn't get put into
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
the role of becoming that expert for
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
those cases our role is abuse or neglect
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have to focus on abuse or neglect and
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
when you get into the realm of talking
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
about best interest of kids and weighing
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
parental rights between two people who
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
are legally fit to be parents that's not
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
really dcyf's role
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then finally the last section of
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
this around
 
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.150 align:start position:0%
this around
the

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
potential for false reporting and
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
making that a misdemeanor there are many
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
states in the country that do that
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
already i don't have a particular
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
objection to it i would just say
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
something for the committee to consider
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
is you know potential chilling effect
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
how do we message that how do we talk
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
about that to make sure that folks
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
understand that making a good faith
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
report is absolutely a protected
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
activity and it's only if you're
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
intentionally trying to weaponize the
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
child protection system that you'd be at
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
risk and with that i'm happy to take
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay so i have a quick
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
because it does state in here that casa
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be but i thought casa didn't do
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
parenting cases like that i thought they
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
were strictly for a child that is in in
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
an abuse or neglect case with dcyf not
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and and they don't do
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
family court as far as
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
divorces or or custody
 
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.829 align:start position:0%
divorces or or custody
whatever

00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely right they only take
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
on cases of child abuse and neglect
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's under you know their own
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
structure their own statute they are
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
mostly volunteers they receive some
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
money through the courts and they
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
receive some money through us for
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
training but it's overwhelmingly
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers that do that work
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think they would see this
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
as being part of their their mandate and
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
mission um i think the way that it's i'm
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
not sure the way that it's written
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
actually says it has to be a casa is as
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
a gal and there are jls that are not
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
casas but i do think that's something
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
that should be clarified
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative ocala
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
question in these states that have
 
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.589 align:start position:0%
question in these states that have
punishments

00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
punishments
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
knowingly trying to weaponize dcyf um
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
are those
 
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
are those
um

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
do those states allow or do you know if
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
those states allow for anonymous
 
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.069 align:start position:0%
those states allow for anonymous
reporting

00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
and if
they

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.910 align:start position:0%
they
do

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
is there a way
 
00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:38.630 align:start position:0%
is there a way
like

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
recordings of the of the phone call and
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
the phone number which the police could
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
then use to
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
de-mask someone if
 
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
de-mask someone if
um

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
if it was found that they were in
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
violation of the crime good question um
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what happens in most of
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
those states you know as you heard it's
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
actually a majority of states that do
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
have some statute on the books around
 
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
have some statute on the books around
that

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
i can tell you one of the big
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
differences between the state where i
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
previously worked that i currently
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
worked is that in new jersey we did
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
record all the calls to intake in new
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire we do not do that
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
that is a way of being able to identify
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
folks even if you're taking anonymous
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
calls and establish patterns um i don't
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's not something that i would be
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to but there would obviously be
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal and practical implications around
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
establishing that here because we don't
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
director representative long
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
director ripson uh
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
have you identified uh
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
reports that were malicious or uh false
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen we it it doesn't
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
happen all the time that it would cross
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
that threshold it's pretty infrequent
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
but we have seen them and actually
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the times that i see them
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes are the same cases that i'm
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
hearing from your colleagues on right
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
one of your colleagues is hearing from a
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
constituent who's unhappy that they
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
don't think dcyf is doing the right
 
00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:02.710 align:start position:0%
don't think dcyf is doing the right
thing

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
we get a call from one of your
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues take a look at this and you
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
know we never share the information with
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
with with your colleagues because it's
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
confidential but we meet with those
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
folks and oftentimes it's these
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
custodial disputes where
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
there might be a difference of opinion
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
between what's the best thing to do for
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
a child or the best way to raise a child
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
but that's not abuse for neglect and i
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
think part of that comes down to this
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
there's a i think there's a
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
misperception of what dcyf's role is in
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
the state right that folks
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
have an opinion that we're supposed to
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
be out there kind of policing all
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
parenting interactions and deciding
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
what's best for all kids and that's not
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
our role our role is very limited to
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect which is a pretty high
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
standard and parents have a lot of
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
leeway to determine what's the best way
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
to raise a child and when you have two
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
parents who are separated you'll often
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
have two parents who have different
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
ideas about the best way to raise a
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
child and that's that's the line that i
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
try to be very careful of of us not
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
creeping into because we
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're not authorized to do that and
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
we're also not resourced and built to do
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
that right okay
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
um anonymous reporting
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
in your professional experience would
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
you suspect that there would be a
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in reporting if i had to give
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
my name address phone number
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
yeah there probably would be there
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
probably some folks who would not be
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable making a report if they were
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
not allowed to make it anonymously
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i i'd be worried about what we might
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
miss under the circumstances sometimes
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
those reports are are reports where
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's some really bad stuff happening
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
sure very good thank you
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
people are fearful right a domestic
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
violence case for instance um
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
if someone is actually still in the home
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
enabled and able to get out i think that
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
would that not create
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
a larger problem
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
i i think that's probably the number one
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
scenario that i think about where
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting is appropriately
 
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.150 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting is appropriately
used

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
um i'll tell you so
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
there are situations where i think it's
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate i personally think that
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
professional reporters should always
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
give their names our law doesn't require
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
that but we try to educate folks we have
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
good colleagues through the know and
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
tell process
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
which is our child advocacy centers
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
granite state children's alliance run
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
that where they really encourage folks
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
to identify themselves and talk to them
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
about the confidential process
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
but in almost all instances you want to
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
know who the reporter is because you
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
want to be able to follow up and dig
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
deeper and the phone call that somebody
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
receives that intake is not going to be
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
as deep as a follow-up conversation with
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
an investigator who's been able to look
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
at other facts and circumstances and
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow up so we really do want people to
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
use their names i would just be afraid
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we'll never accept a report where
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't identify themselves
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
up next is richard head
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
he's asked for two minutes to speak to
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch i did submit written
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony on the online
 
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.349 align:start position:0%
testimony on the online
submission

00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
submission
 
00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:20.710 align:start position:0%
submission
process

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple request
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with the effective date of 60
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
days we're asking that it be moved to
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
january 1 2023
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason being a statute that
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
governs effective dates of legislation
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 14 colon 9-a
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
provides that every law affecting
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
judicial practice and procedure or
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
establishing or eliminating criminal
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
prohibitions shall take effect on the
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
january 1 following passage this bill
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
creates a new rsa 169 c31 roman
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 which creates a new criminal
 
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.109 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 which creates a new criminal
penalty

00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the reason we care is there's a
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
process after the legislative session
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with a whole host of changes to
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislation if you look at it just at
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal provisions
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
there's the j-1 program where we have
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
the uniform charge table where every
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
criminal charge is listed on a on a
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
table that is used by law enforcement
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
when they are charging individuals to
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have consistency and
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
then it ties into the odyssey database
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the court maintains and anytime
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's even a minor tweak to any line
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the criminal code or any statute that
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
has a criminal provision the uniform
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
charge table has to be modified and
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
updated and our odyssey database has to
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
be modified to match it exactly
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
and over the course of a legislative
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
session there's several
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
hundred at least changes that are made
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it just takes a great deal of time
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure we it gets done
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's done with the department of safety
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
department of justice in our office and
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
and trying to make sure that everyone is
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
exactly right because it affects how
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
charges are made
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
so we simply ask that the uh there be an
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to change uh section five of
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
the bill effective date to 60 days after
 
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.549 align:start position:0%
the bill effective date to 60 days after
passage

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
passage
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then with regard and just
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
since there was a question about the gal
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
um it does say shallow point there is
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
not a gal fund um so there is no state
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
fund currently
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
there previously had been it is no
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
longer in existence so there is no state
 
00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:24.790 align:start position:0%
longer in existence so there is no state
fund

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
that does pay for
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
gals when the parties are unable to pay
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
i mean with that i'd be happy to answer
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i just i just have one question so
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
then if
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
even if we changed it to may would that
 
00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:40.470 align:start position:0%
even if we changed it to may would that
then

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
an unfair some cases at a at almost an
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage or
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
i mean just because you're poor doesn't
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know you shouldn't have a gal in
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
that case right so but if we're only
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to allow those who have the money
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
to pay i i just feel like there's a big
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
kind of conflict there where we're
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
leaving a bunch of people out if we're
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the gal fund was useful um in currently
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
if the parties are unable to pay i mean
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is a consideration the court takes
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
into account when
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
appointing a gal and the parties are
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
unable to pay there is no other funding
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
source so
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are certainly cases in which
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
a gal may be appropriate that do not get
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
appointed a gal i won't disagree with
 
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.069 align:start position:0%
appointed a gal i won't disagree with
that

00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
 
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.109 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
much

parents for the last 15 years
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
i want to speak today about why
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine's bill hb 1612
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
is so important this bill will replace
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting to dcyf's hotline
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
with confidential reporting anonymous
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
reporting refers to the ability of a
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
caller to make an allegation of abuse or
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
neglect and not leave any identifying
 
00:56:31.119 --> 00:56:32.230 align:start position:0%
neglect and not leave any identifying
information

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
with confidential reporting dcyf still
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
keeps the caller's identity a secret but
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
the caller must provide the name and
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
other identifying information and
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
importantly the bill states quote the
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
department shall inform the complainant
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
that should the complaint be made
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
maliciously or with intent to harm that
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
the identity of the complainer shall not
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
be kept sealed end quote and the bill
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
provides civil and criminal penalties if
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
a caller quote knowingly make false
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
statements of suspected child abuse end
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
quote hb 1612 will significantly reduce
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
if not eliminate false and malicious
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
reports of child abuse and neglect
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
thereby protecting innocent children and
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
families and allowing dcyf to focus
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
attention on children who are truly
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse and neglect
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of an unnecessary
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
government investigation the director of
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf alluded to this and i want to
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
direct you to a law review article by
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%

was published in the william mary law

review
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
in 2005. she wrote the following quote
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
in the name of saving children from the
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
harm that their parents and guardians
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
are thought to pose states ultimately
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
cause more harm to many more children
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
than they ever help in 2002 for example
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
the states conducted approximately 1.8
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
million investigations concerning the
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
welfare of nearly 3.2 million children
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
only about 896 000 or 28 percent of
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
these children were ultimately found to
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
be victims of abuse or neglect 71
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
percent or roughly 2.3 million children
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
were thus subjected to state-mandated
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
thorough investigations involving at a
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
minimum interviews examinations and or
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
home visits in circumstances where the
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
state in the end could not show that the
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
children were unsafe and in need of
 
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.069 align:start position:0%
children were unsafe and in need of
rescue

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
investigating these children is
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state's highly
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
precautionary strategy to remedy the
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
nation's maltreatment problem however
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the investigated
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
child the process is not so clearly
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
meritorious indeed despite the
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
authority's best intention intentions
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
the process can be harmful in two
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
related ways first
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
the investigations undermine the
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
fundamental values of privacy dignity
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
personal security and mobility that are
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
protected by the fourth amendment and
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's critical that uh the in this regard
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the fourth amendment uniquely has
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
been interpreted to recognize the
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
child's own individual interest in these
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
values by guarding her right also to be
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
free from unreasonable searches and
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
seizures both inside and outside the
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%

00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
second depending upon the child
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the nature of the investigation the
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
process can cause severe emotional and
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
psychological damage ranging from
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
temporary discomfort to significant
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
long-term harm end quote
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
this account is nearly 20 years old
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
today based on national numbers reported
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
by the states and published the u.s
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%

administration for children and families
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
children's bureau the figure has held
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
steady in recent years at around 83
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
percent of child abuse and neglect
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
investigations are unfounded and
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
shockingly among investigations started
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
with an anonymous tip the number of
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
false or erroneous reports jumps to a
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
whopping 96 percent
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is simple if you and
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
i were to suspect child abuse or neglect
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
was going on we would have no hesitation
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
to provide our name or contact
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
information we would do anything to
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
protect a child but when you bring in
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting there is no such
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
protection anonymous reporting
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
encourages false reports by disgruntled
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors political opponents scorned
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
lovers and ex-spouses there's a term for
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
this that we've heard weaponizing the
 
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
this that we've heard weaponizing the
system

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1612 will end this loophole in the
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
law it will end the system from being
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
able to be weaponized against innocent
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
families importantly also there's an
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
equity issue it will protect families of
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
color as studies have shown through the
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and others that
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
children of color are removed from their
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
families at far higher rates than white
 
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.150 align:start position:0%
families at far higher rates than white
children

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
passage of hb 1612 into law will protect
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
innocent children and families and it
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
will allow dcyf to focus on children who
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
are truly at risk for abuse and neglect
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr estrada
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to kind of uh
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
re-ask the question that i asked before
 
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.870 align:start position:0%
re-ask the question that i asked before
about

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
other states and how
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
those other states if you're aware
 
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
those other states if you're aware
have

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
punishments for people
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
trying to weaponize the dcyf system
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
require confidential or do some allow
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting and then
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
if it is found to be
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
malicious then
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf could hol hand over the phone
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
number and a tape recording of it to the
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
police and the police can do an
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
investigation to see if that um
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
if they can identify that person and and
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
charge them i would refer you to a law
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
review article by dale checker it's her
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
name was spelled
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
c-e-c-k-a and i can provide you later
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
that it's 64 catholic university law
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
review 51 published in 2015. dale
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
checker was then a professor of law at
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
the university of richmond she's now the
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general for the state
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
of georgia and she went case by case
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
through every state 40 states in the
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
district of columbia allow by statute
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
anonymous calls to their child abuse
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
hotlines there are 10 states that have
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
confidential reporting all these 10
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
states however do have procedures in
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
place where they'll encourage
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
confidential reporting so give us your
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
name and phone number but if the caller
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
refuses to they won't push it and
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
they'll still accept the report all 50
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
states do have state laws that make it's
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor to make a false report the
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
the difficulty however is
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you're accepting an anonymous report
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to prove it i think we
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
heard from the um
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
or difficult to find who made that
 
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.829 align:start position:0%
or difficult to find who made that
report

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
we heard from from the head of dcyf that
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
new jersey for example records these
 
01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
new jersey for example records these
calls

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
calls
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
no one's really spending the time to do
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
voice analysis or find that out so again
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's very very difficult to find if
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're accepting anonymous reports who
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually is making those anonymous
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
um follow up
 
01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:13.589 align:start position:0%
um follow up
yeah

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
can you um i guess just
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds like um
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
not all of the states that have
 
01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
not all of the states that have
um

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
from from your testimony it sounds like
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
not all the states that have a
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor punishment um
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh require confidential reporting some
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
do still allow anonymous reporting even
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
though they have that punishment is that
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
though they have that punishment is that
right

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony am i understanding that
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
correctly correct yeah so again 40
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
states allow in their code anonymous
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
reporting 10 states will will encourage
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
the confidential reporting it's in their
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
state code but the state children and
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
welfare cps will still accept these
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
confidential reports although they have
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor charges for a false
 
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor charges for a false
report

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to actually
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
prosecute those because there is just no
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
information that's provided
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam uh
 
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.029 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam uh
chair

01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
so

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
is your testimony that there are no
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
states that
 
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.870 align:start position:0%
states that
require

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
require
um

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
your name
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
when reporting
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
their courage and some absolutely don't
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
great question representative so 10
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
states do require it in their in their
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
state reporting and again this was dale
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
checkers um
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
analysis state by state but of those 10
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
states that that have a confidential
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
reporting statute as opposed to
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
anonymous they still by policy will
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
accept an anonymous report
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
it does provide greater protection
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
though and i think one of the benefits
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
of hb 1612 is just that fact that the uh
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
that the dcyf person who's answering the
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
phone on the 24 7 anonymous tip hotline
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
or or hotline will give that warning
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that if you file a false report you
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
could face penalties that'll that's
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
something that that would that would be
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
unique um in in state codes and i think
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful in reminding
 
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful in reminding
people

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
this is not just something this is this
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
is something if you're if you're filing
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
a false report it can come back to bite
 
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
a false report it can come back to bite
you

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
follow up for me
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
so would this be the wouldn't if this
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
were to go through would this state be
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
the first that does not allow
 
01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:46.549 align:start position:0%
the first that does not allow

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
it would be it would join the other 10
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
states that by statute don't um accept
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous the the
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
it i guess it would depend on on how
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
dcyf would implement it the way it's
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
written it doesn't in my mind prohibit
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
dcyf from still encouraging the
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
confidential reporting so there may
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
still be an avenue where it would where
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
they would take down that that
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
allegation i don't see it prohibiting
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
that um but it would
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't make new hampshire alone
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
in that case it would become the 11th
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
state um i think it would significantly
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the concerns of of that we've
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
raised of anonymous reporting very good
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
you next is um
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
is it russian
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
um chester to speak in support of the
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill i'm going to ask you to keep it to
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
three minutes because we're really
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
hi my name is russ ann chester i
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to come forward as a former cps
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
worker here in this state as well as in
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
another state
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
my experience in this state although
 
01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
my experience in this state although
it's

01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
older now
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a worker we have always always wanted
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
to know the name just in case so and i
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
thought i understand the whole issue
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
with anonymous reporting and we don't
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
want to um to do any kind of chilling
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
effect i understand that completely
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's an easy fix to that we have an
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
800 number that goes to central intake
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's an essential intake can take that
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
information and keep it and if they
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't want their information disclosed
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
they put a star on it or something so it
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the district office so the
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
person that's doing the investigation
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what's going on but if we
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
need more information because
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you we're a small
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
state by the time we get out there they
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
usually know parents usually know we're
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
coming um
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to hide something they
 
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to hide something they
can

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
i can honestly tell you i think a lot of
 
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.670 align:start position:0%
i can honestly tell you i think a lot of
our

01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
devastating results of child illness and
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
or child abuse and neglect in the state
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
is because of anonymous reporting we are
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
one of the few states that allows um
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
everybody in this every adult in this
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
state is a mandated reporter
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
um that being said with that kind of
 
01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
um that being said with that kind of
responsibility

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
with that kind of of of
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility comes some sort of
 
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
responsibility comes some sort of
accountability

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
so what happens when an anonymous report
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
comes in the person goes out
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you get
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
a ton of anonymous reports
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
from the same
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
you get on on the same family those end
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
up starting getting screened out
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
people aren't being going out aren't
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
going out to see those children so
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's a second problem with the
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting thing
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
because the person that's taking that
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
call and at central intake is not
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily always that same person
 
01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.189 align:start position:0%
necessarily always that same person
um

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:01.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
that being said i really appreciate this
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
bill for that reason
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is important and should
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
be protected but the children and
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
families who are being reported on
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
should also be protected and anonymous
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
reporting does not allow that
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
i would argue that there's a lot more
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting than just the angry
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
parent um when i was doing child
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
protection in this state and i saw a lot
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
more of it in arizona
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
there is a huge issue with
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
i've gotten into a conflict with you
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
i know you have kids so i'm going to
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
report on you
 
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.669 align:start position:0%
report on you
um

01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
i do have concerns about the gal part
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is gal um most
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the guardian item first of all we
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a huge shortage of guardian items
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
second of all most guardian items are
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys um they have done some small
 
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
attorneys um they have done some small
piece

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
of uh understanding
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
child family relationships but they
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly aren't social workers and at
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
the same time i would hate to see
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
as the representative from dcyf said i
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
would hate to see child protection
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
workers now taking on the responsibility
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
of deciding what's in the best interest
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the child when they specifically are
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
there for abuse and neglect
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
questions

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.270 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
up next is catherine shea
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill she's
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
asked for 10 minutes i'm going to ask
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
you to cut it to 5 because we're really
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
short on time
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
good morning committee thank you for
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
kate or catherine shea from goffstown
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
i have to admit that i'm a bit rattled
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
coming here today because i'm a parent
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
advocate that speaks regularly in
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
education meetings but
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
i came to relay my own personal
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
experience which
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
sort of brings back some ptsd for me
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
a six-year divorce
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that was incredibly painful and nasty
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
and didn't need to be that way and the
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
process that we went through did not
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
protect us in any way
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm here not to talk about pointing
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
fingers at one group or the other or
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
should we do this or that
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
in support of this because it's doing
 
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
in support of this because it's doing
something

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
no sorry about that um
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i didn't mean to like shine
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
the light in your eyes um
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
so so i normally go to a lot of uh
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearings to speak on behalf of children
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
i'm an educational advocate and a state
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer parent of four three of them
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
have autism there are a lot of parents
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
like me and you're not seeing a lot of
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
parents out here today right but it's
 
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
parents out here today right but it's
because

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
we don't even have the wherewithal to
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're trying to make it through
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
every day right and a lot of us end up
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
we have special needs kids we end up
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
going down this path of divorce it's
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunate it's really sad but because
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
of other supports and services we didn't
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
have we find ourselves on that path
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then we find ourselves further
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
attacked by maliciousness so when i
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
heard this bill was coming up i was glad
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
because i heard of other states that did
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
have some stop gap measures from just
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
a free-for-all right like somebody was
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
speaking about your your neighbor or
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
somebody it's at the school and you're
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing for your
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
child get an iep and the next thing you
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
know somebody's called in some
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
ridiculous complaint
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to know where to start
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
with this but i wanted to speak from the
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
heart to you guys today to say i'm in
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
support of it um i have heard arguments
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
for safety and for you know all these
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
other reasons and as i'm helping one of
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
my children learn about the constitution
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
i have to go back to something that
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
benjamin franklin said about safety and
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through all these
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
quotes but if we give up a little
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
essential liberty to purchase a little
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
temporary safety we deserve neither
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
liberty nor safety and in our world
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
today we've given them up okay so the
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
people out here like me there's not many
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
that can come into these hearings
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
because we're like
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
treading water just trying to you know
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
make ends meet and help our kids the
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
best we can we have sometimes special
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
needs kids we're taking advantage
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe me of every opportunity out
 
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
believe me of every opportunity out
there

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
but when people get away with things
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
like this and there's no consequences
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's like i mean i i've never had high
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
blood pressure in my life as soon as we
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
hit you know the hurdles with my kids
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
special needs and we were fighting iep
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
battles and then the divorce battle and
 
01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
battles and then the divorce battle and
then

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
we even had a guardian ad litem and
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
none of that helped to protect us
 
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
none of that helped to protect us
um

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
and you kind of left sitting there as an
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
adult almost 50 going
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
wow i was really disillusioned i thought
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
all this was here to protect us but
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've given it all up over time
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
so i am in favor of this i do think
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's some i work in i.t i work with
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know process re-engineering kind of
 
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
you know process re-engineering kind of
things

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
if we can fix this process put in some
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
stop gaps we are going to prevent
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
disasters from happening and to
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
happening happening to good families
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
right and we can use those resources
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
instead of them being directed to attack
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
people from malicious means
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to worthwhile endeavors to help children
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
like harmony or others right that need
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
the help my mother was a social worker
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming from a perspective that
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
understands social work she was a public
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
school teacher social worker i have two
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
sisters that are public school teachers
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
i get it but sometimes our processes
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
aren't working exactly as they were
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
intended right maybe we in the in the
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
guys of safety have given too much and
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
we haven't put in the stop gaps that we
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
have those checks and balances that like
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
i said as i teach my son about the
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
constitution they were originally
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
intended to be there but somehow we
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
found ourselves even in the court of law
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
somebody can make something up and
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's in family court no one to hold
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
them accountable for you know speaking a
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
lie that's not even something that's
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
prosecuted anymore in family law cases
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
whoever throws the lies at the wall fast
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
enough and gets them to stick gets heard
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what happens in these
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
cases especially in divorce where it's
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
the person out of the gates thinks they
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
can just lob an attack and that's what
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
happened to me to the point where the
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
person reneged and they right in front
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
of the social worker said i just you
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
know i met he made up something he's i
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
misunderstood uh you know didn't really
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
mean it you know and i'm thinking well
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a consequence it's now
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
happened two almost three times
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
so at what point is there a consequence
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
or to the school nurse who decides to be
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
nasty because she says well you know
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
your son's going to the hospital but i
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
didn't get medical records well hello
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
lady you don't get medical records those
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
are protected so which what does she do
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
she picks up the phone i'm gonna get her
 
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
she picks up the phone i'm gonna get her
back

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
back
boom

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
boom
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know and it doesn't matter how much
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
of it's unfounded doesn't matter because
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
it sticks to you
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and and when you're a good parent
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
it does what i just it raises your blood
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
pressure it nearly gives you a coronary
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
to come home and see something you know
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
tacked your door
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's not right that people are getting
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
away with us and i think that's all
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're asking for as parents is for some
 
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
we're asking for as parents is for some
justice

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
some real consequences if we have to
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
face consequences in the adult world for
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
speeding or this or that like certainly
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
there should be a consequence for
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
something so serious that someone's
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
children could be put in jeopardy
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
especially mine with special needs i
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know so i'm here to speak despite
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know it is a scary thing
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
and and as i said i had to face the six
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
years i got dragged through something
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
that i didn't want
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's not enough against them this is not
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
a parents against ecy if this is a
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
got some problems with the process so
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
like what can we do to fix that
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that's all i'm here to say so thank
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
you for your time do you have any
 
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.510 align:start position:0%
you for your time do you have any
questions

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
question um if
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussions about gals
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality versus anonymous
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
if those things were
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
stripped out of the bill and it was just
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
a a punishment on the books and the dcy
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
of people on the phone saying if this is
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
false there could be consequences do you
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that's enough to
 
01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
think that's enough to
to

01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
say that this is moving us in the right
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
direction and then we could come back if
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's still issues to
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
maybe enhance those um
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
those protections further let's say if
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
if if dcyf has
 
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.310 align:start position:0%
if if dcyf has
um

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
multiple cases that they're saying
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know they're anonymous and we
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
weren't able to prosecute them
 
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.229 align:start position:0%
weren't able to prosecute them
um

01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
but we know that they were abusing the
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
system so we need some more you know
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
strength in that aspect but
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
do you believe that it's necessary right
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
now or do you think that um we could
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
take this
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
a baby step and it doesn't necessarily
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
need to be all or nothing in this case
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it needs to be bigger
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
than a baby step because we kind of have
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the baby step now if you were to get
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
your records you can i mean some names
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
are redacted and whatnot but you can
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
essentially figure out
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
who is saying what you really can it
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know it's not rocket science
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
but what i do think is there's too many
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
people hiding behind layers of
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality or not and
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
i could say the word being anonymous um
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know for an example in one of my
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
situations and the person knew somebody
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
on the inside and they used a mental
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
health worker so not only are they
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
anonymous but they're hiding behind a
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
mental health worker now so you got two
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
layers like there's there's multiple
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
layers of protection but for the person
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
on the outside of this
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's none so i think we have to do
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
better than a baby step
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
for the gal
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know having had gone through that
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
process myself i mean i heard someone
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
else speak about this they are attorneys
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
um you quickly learn and going through a
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
family law case that you're just you're
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're paying for the
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
vacation home for your for the attorneys
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
essentially right they're building a
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
home at a i mean my case alone thirty
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars both sides easily
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
without even paying the gal you know and
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
we are not a family of means you know so
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's devastated us but the gal was an
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
added expense and it you know honestly
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
it was something i was advised by my
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
attorney to get and it didn't come back
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
to help me one bit
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
there was no added value you know i'm
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily opposed to gal but
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
adding overhead for the sake of overhead
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
or oversight i'm not a big fan of that
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i think we need other measures in
 
01:19:12.159 --> 01:19:13.030 align:start position:0%
so i think we need other measures in
place

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
and not just rely upon somebody to
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
enforce it or this department to do that
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
or adding another position
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some incremental you
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
know warnings along the way i do know
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
wisconsin will send a warning i believe
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
when somebody
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
makes a complaint and they send them
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
back a letter i believe with something
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
effective be aware that this is a
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
punishable offense if you're making a
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
false complaint so i mean there's
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's other options out there but i
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't think i think it needs to be
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
stronger than just
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know the change in um the level of
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
information that's
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to be provided
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
all right seeing them thank you very
 
01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
all right seeing them thank you very
much

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
and up next we have jr hall to speak in
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
support of the bill who's asked for five
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
quick minutes
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the record j.r hole former state rep
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
former member of this committee
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
i ended my service in 2018 i'm here to
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of house bill
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of house bill
1612.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
1612.
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to skip over section one i
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
no opinion on that my wife and i are
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
happily married
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
and with four children and
 
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
and with four children and
um

01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
this seems relevant to divorce
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings so i'm i can't
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
make an opinion on that i want to speak
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
to sections too and following
 
01:20:42.159 --> 01:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
to sections too and following
um

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm living through this nightmare
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
because of a gag order there is very
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
limited information i can share about
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
what's going on in my life
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell you this started as an
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
anonymous report
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
at some level
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay it was not hard to figure out where
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
this started
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
in my personal life
 
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.470 align:start position:0%
in my personal life
okay

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.910 align:start position:0%
okay
confidential

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
someone to come back later on and figure
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
out where this started and depose them
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
in a courtroom if necessary
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone making hearsay evidence that
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
starts an investigation and then someone
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
being able to to call on that person to
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
substantiate that
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
our constitution is extremely clear part
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
first article 15 that so no subject
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
shall be held to answer for any crime or
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
offense and in some cases dcyf
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
is pursuing both criminal activity
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay as part of their jurisdiction okay
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
crimes against a person that are
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
significant enough that someone should
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
go to jail and then they are also doing
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
civil level cases
 
01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:52.870 align:start position:0%
civil level cases
where

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
it could almost be a matter of
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
parenting i will go back to reading the
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
constitution no right shall we answer
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
for any crime or offense and the civil
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
stuff falls under a fence until the same
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
is plain fully and plainly and
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
substantially informally described to
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
him right
 
01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.629 align:start position:0%
him right
and

01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
it goes on to talk about the fact that
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we should be able
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
to have that person right to be able to
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
as i said i i
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
because of a court order i'm limited in
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
what i can share right now but i can
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
tell you confidentiality is what drives
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
some of the corruption into this system
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
that if there was more transparency
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
about what was going on
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
as representative long said it might
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
diminish a little bit about the
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
reporting there is that is a a
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern
 
01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.310 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern
however

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
if there is real harm
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
the person who's making the the
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory the mandatory reporter the
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
person who is calling into the system
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
has a reason to want to make that phone
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
call there's not going to be a concern
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would also like to say
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
i have one concern on section four just
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
from a straight drafting point okay and
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is the last line
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay under no circumstances shall the
 
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
okay under no circumstances shall the
identity

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the complainant who made the report
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
of suspected abuse or neglect in good
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
faith or pursuant to rsa 169 c29 be
 
01:23:21.679 --> 01:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
faith or pursuant to rsa 169 c29 be
released

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's overly broad it should be
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
released publicly at a minimum right it
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to be given to the
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
respondent so that the respondent in
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
these cases can talk to that person or
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
there is no way to have justice
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
if only if one side says hey i've got
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
some information
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to be able to share it
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
with you tell you i just know that this
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
person has done something wrong
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
that does not give us the transparency
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the justice our system deserves
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
i would ask that this court i'm sorry
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
been to court a lot um asked that this
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
committee passed this bill i don't know
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
about section one i'm not going to speak
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
to section one but sections two through
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
the end with the with the one exception
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the change that i asked for
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
about that last line be passed i would
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
go further that the language should be
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
even more clear that in
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
that the confidential name could be and
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
might be released
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the respondents if this matter is
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
found to be founded and to go forward
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
into a court proceeding because at that
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
point the mandatory reporter should know
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be potentially on
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
on a witness stand
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
but if they have real facts that they're
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
reporting then they should be allowed to
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
make right they should be willing to
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
stand up for what they believe to be
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
true if they're not this might be and
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is how this whole thing filters out
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
the alleged
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
right the false allegations they're not
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to stand they're not going to be
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
willing to go to court over a false
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
allegation and put themselves in risk of
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
perjury so
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
i thank you i again ask that you support
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill um and that would be it okay
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i have a quick question
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
so who is responsible
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
if that name gets out and that person
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
ends up killed
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
by the person i mean it's real domestic
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
violence is real
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
right and if that name gets out
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
someone's going to get killed and i
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
would also bring up you know
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
a certain case that's in the media now
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
i would take one look at that person see
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
a teardrop
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
tattoo and
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
be an extreme fear for my own safety if
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
my name got out there as the reporter of
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
that abuse to them
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i i that's that's where i want to
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
know who is then liable when that
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
someone gets killed
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
well if someone is killed the person who
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
did whom who committed the murder is
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
liable right but i think the point here
 
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.629 align:start position:0%
liable right but i think the point here
is

01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
there is there is ways under the
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statutes of c25 right
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
169-c 25 and other places under 170.
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay to keep certain information within
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
what happens to the court but the
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
respondent should always be allowed to
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
know who made the report and if if if
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
the respondent is the one who commits
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
murder right
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
that person is going to jail
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
but would you not agree that the state
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
by

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
by giving that name out i
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
if there was an actual report
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
where there was harm done right criminal
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
harm in most cases but is what the basis
 
01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:47.590 align:start position:0%
harm in most cases but is what the basis
is

01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.709 align:start position:0%
is
and

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
that mandatory reporter be it a person
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
might be at a public official be it a
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
medical professional whoever right be it
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know a teacher or a librarian or
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
something okay
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
if they actually had real concerns
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things they could do if
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
they knew their name was going to be
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
out there they could in fact ask for a
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
protective order to make sure that this
 
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
protective order to make sure that this
that

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the respondent right
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
is not allowed near them there's a lot
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
of things they could do to protect
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
themselves if necessary if there is true
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
harm and i think that's the thing is
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
statutes are hard to write i sat up here
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
for eight years okay because
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of the one percent on both
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
extremes in terms of the cases that make
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
it hard to write legislation because on
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
one case
 
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
one case
and

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
with good
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
i like your question because you could
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
have a case where someone is fearful of
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
their life in terms of if i share this i
 
01:27:46.239 --> 01:27:47.430 align:start position:0%
their life in terms of if i share this i
know

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know i know my cousin for
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
instance might come back and try and
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
harm me i'm not saying that personally
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
i can see that concern especially where
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's there may be a mismatch between
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
genders right it may be a female who's a
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about an overly aggressive guy
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
right the typical way someone sees this
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
i can see that but i can also see where
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
someone hides behind the current
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
confidentiality sorry the the current
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
anonymous statutes
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
and aggravates a divorce that's going on
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
in family court or
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
another type of case
 
01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
another type of case
and

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
i can say with absolute certainty i've
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
never talked to dcyf they've never
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
talked to my family until
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
eight weeks ago
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the first case record was of this
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
case there was zero before that
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay but i can also see what's going on
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of how they pigpiled on top of
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
that in terms of other reports that have
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with it
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
i just the anonymousness and fortunately
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
the judge was willing to say something
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
like no i want the names of everybody
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
released in this case so the respondent
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
can at least figure out whether they
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
need to be on the stand in question
 
01:29:00.159 --> 01:29:01.590 align:start position:0%
need to be on the stand in question
so

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
my point here is
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
as you guys draft this bill understand
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
the bill has to cover a very broad
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
spectrum and the false reporting is the
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
concern right now and how do we mitigate
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
that how do we make sure that if someone
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
is maliciously accused of a crime or of
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect that they have a chance
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
to cross-examine their accuser
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately or at least in a
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
deposition they may not be able to do it
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
in a court but their attorney could do
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
it in a deposition
 
01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
it in a deposition
okay

01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr hull
 
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr hull
um

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
i mean do you agree that malicious or
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
intent to harm is a high bar to prove
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative long i do malicious is is
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
a very high bar to
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
um to point to
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
and if i can follow up
 
01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
and if i can follow up
um

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in in section four
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're asking that um you're asking that
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
there be no
 
01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
there be no
um

01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
no not anonymity on any reporting is
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
that no no no that's not thank you for
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
the question um no what i'm saying is in
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
lines 27 28 okay
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
that currently the way i would write
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
read this okay
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would prohibit that information from
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
being shared at all to anybody within
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
who's a party to the to the case and i'm
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
not sure that that is actually what the
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills was intending to do right be
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
released means publicly as opposed to to
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
the parties in the case
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
if you were to do this
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
right you could inadvertently wipe out
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of the other things you're trying
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
right so it's just it's it's a clerical
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
thing more than an intent thing right
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative yokela thank you and
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question it
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me that um
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is more than
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
one reason for collecting this
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
information this
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the that the
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
information is being collected in this
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill so that
 
01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
bill so that
um

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
if there was malicious intent with the
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
reporting that that could be filed and
 
01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.510 align:start position:0%
reporting that that could be filed and
charged

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
charged
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
against that person
 
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
against that person
and

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
you seem to be suggesting that
 
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:39.370 align:start position:0%
you seem to be suggesting that
the

01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:39.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.270 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that the person that is reporting
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
that the person that is reporting
the

01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
the things that they saw to dcyf or
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
have reason to believe to dcyf
 
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
have reason to believe to dcyf
that

01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
that is
um

01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of getting that
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
information is so that that it can be
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
used in
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
in court whereas i think
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
and you were talking about responding to
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
the person essentially alleging a crime
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
that dcyf takes in that information and
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
they go and do the research and they are
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
the one that actually go to court and
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
allege the crime not the person that
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh originally
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
said hey something might fishy might be
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
going on here is that your understanding
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
correct let me restate right in most
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
cases it is dcyf that is
 
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.790 align:start position:0%
cases it is dcyf that is
99

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
99
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
that i can bring up another case right
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
when it becomes a medical neglect issue
 
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.750 align:start position:0%
when it becomes a medical neglect issue
okay

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the initial reporter is
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
is significant and important which is
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
different than let's say
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
i call right hypothetically again i
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
called because i was concerned about the
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
screaming i heard at my neighbor's house
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
my neighbors are fine there's no
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
screaming going on but right there's a
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
difference there but i think taking the
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
information on has multiple values the
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
most important of which is if there if
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf needs to follow up with that person
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
later on all that information is
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.430 align:start position:0%
excuse me
secondly

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
if this matter moves forward because
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
there is some basis to move forward
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for the
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
respondent in these cases okay or if
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's a if it ends up being a criminal
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
case because
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
the alleged abuse is is
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
is greater than just
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
civil in nature the defendant
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
you would have a chance for that person
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
who's on the responding end to be able
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
to cross-examine them in a court
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay because there may be first-hand
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
evidence of that initial reporter that
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
has to come out
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the person who's pursuing
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
the charges right dcyf acts kind of as
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor in this stance
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the person who was the
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
firsthand witness they are a secondhand
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
witness in all they take the information
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
they they write a report
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
much like the police do but they were
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
not the first hand witness so there
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
might be a need to have a discussion
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
with the firsthand witness later on
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
you members okay so i'm going to close
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb 1612 and i will
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on hb 1280 and i
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
have no pink card so can someone just
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill really quick for me
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
because it has to be introduced before i
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
can even
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
take a it's terry royce
 
01:35:02.639 --> 01:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
take a it's terry royce
but

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh 1280. you don't even have to
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
speak to it you just have to introduce
 
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
speak to it you just have to introduce
it

01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative spelaine thank you
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
committee

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh i am introducing
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
hb 1280 on behalf of terry roy the prime
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor because he could not be here to
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to call on lisa lipkin
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
who's asked for eight minutes
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read a statement if i read
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
a little quickly it could be less than
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
eight minutes okay
 
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
eight minutes okay
um

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee thank
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my comments and support
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
of hb1 1280. for the sake of time i
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
won't take a poll but i imagine that
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
many of you are parents and those who
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
are not are beloved aunts uncles and
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
family friends
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
from that vantage point you understand
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
the unique nearly boundless love you
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
have for the children in your lives
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
this love is universal
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
lifelong and pervasive
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
it is the norm
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the mental health field it is well
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
known that the loss of a child is the
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
most catastrophic trauma that could be
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
fall apparent
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
conversely for children the loss of a
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
parent is emotionally tantamount to
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
their own death
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
therefore any externally imposed
 
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.390 align:start position:0%
therefore any externally imposed
separation

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
separation
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
i.e termination of parental rights must
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
be considered in this scale
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
the fact is most parents dearly love
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
their children and do everything in
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
their power to help them grow and thrive
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
are there exceptions of course
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
but there are fewer than you might
 
01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
but there are fewer than you might
imagine

01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
i ran some numbers
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the u.s census stated that there
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
were 73 73.1 million children in the
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
united states
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
according to the u.s department of
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
health and human services in that same
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
year there were
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
656 000 cases of abuse or neglect in our
 
01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.709 align:start position:0%
656 000 cases of abuse or neglect in our
country

01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
now let me be clear
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
every single incidence of child abuse or
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
neglect is one too many and thoroughly
 
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.070 align:start position:0%
neglect is one too many and thoroughly
unacceptable

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
but here's the important perspective
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
those numbers calculate to .008
 
01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.590 align:start position:0%
those numbers calculate to .008
percent

01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
that means less than one percent of u.s
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
children are actually abused or
 
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.430 align:start position:0%
children are actually abused or
neglected

01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a relief
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
so let's now place that knowledge around
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
the current pressure exerted upon
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
parents to vaccinate their children with
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
an experimental shot that has no
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
long-term safety data and is showing
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
alarming side effects including death
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
it must be said that all vaccines carry
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
risks including the risk of death
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
the independent peer-reviewed data in
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
support of not vaccinating children is
 
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.790 align:start position:0%
support of not vaccinating children is
enormous

01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
but i am not going to focus on general
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines right now i'm just going to
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
focus this testimony on the covet 19
 
01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
focus this testimony on the covet 19
vaccine

01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
more numbers
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
a harvard study done a few years prior
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
to the onset of covet 19 concluded that
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 1 and 10
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
of adverse reactions are reported to the
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
this is the cdc's own database designed
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
to track vaccine injuries
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
given that harvard study we can be
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
certain that the following numbers
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
presented by wisconsin senator ron
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
johnson and a press conference this past
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
november are well below the actual data
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
calculated over 25 years
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
the total annual adverse events for the
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
averaged 7596
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
with 76 deaths
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
total deaths from the flu vaccines over
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
25 years of flu vaccines
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
less than 2 000 deaths again every death
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
is a tragedy but less than 2 000 deaths
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
contrast this with 10 months
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
10 months of the covet 19 injection
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
adverse events reported
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
are 818
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
forty four this is in november
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is eight one hundred and eight
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
times that of the flu vaccine
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
with seventeen thousand one hundred and
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
twenty eight deaths
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
that number of deaths is 225
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
times higher than the annual number of
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
deaths from the flu vaccine
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
this injection is a completely different
 
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.310 align:start position:0%
this injection is a completely different
creature

01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
creature
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
as it relates to children
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
dr robert malone is a u.s virologist and
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
immunologist who has dedicated his
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
professional existence to the
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
development of mrna vaccines
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
in december 2021 he made a public
 
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.669 align:start position:0%
in december 2021 he made a public
statement

01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the entire transcript is here and i can
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
give you guys for copies
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
but i'll just be a little briefer and
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
dr malone says
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
before you inject your child a decision
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
that is irreversible
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
i want to let you know that the
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
scientific the scientific facts about
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
this genetic vaccine which is based in
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
the mrna vaccine technology i created
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
there are three issues parents need to
 
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.430 align:start position:0%
there are three issues parents need to
understand

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
the first is that a viral gene will be
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
injected into your children's cells
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
this gene forces your body your child's
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
body to make toxic spike proteins
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
these proteins often cause permanent
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
damage in children's critical organs
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
including their brain and nervous system
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
heart muscles includes blood clots their
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
productive system and this vaccine can
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
trigger trigger fundamental changes to
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
their immune system
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
the most alarming point about this is
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
that once these damages have occurred
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
they are irreparable
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
you can't fix the lesions in their brain
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
you can't repair heart issues
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
you can't repair heart tissue scarring
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can't repair a genetically reset
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
immune system and this vaccine can cause
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
productive reproductive damage that
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
could affect future generations
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
of your family
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
the second thing you need to know is
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
that this novel technology has not been
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
adequately tested we need at least five
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
years of testing slash research before
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
we can really understand the risks
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
ask yourself if you want your own child
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
to be part of the most radical medical
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
experiment in human history
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
one final point
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
the reason they are giving to vaccinate
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
your child is a lie
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
your children represent zero danger to
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
their parents or grandparents it is
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually the opposite their immunity
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
after getting covet is critical to save
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
your family if not the world from this
 
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.229 align:start position:0%
your family if not the world from this
disease

01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
the risk benefit analysis isn't even
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
close as a parent and grandparent my
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation to you is to resist and
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
fight to protect your children
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
99 of parents do not abuse or neglect
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
neglectful harmful parents are not the
 
01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.990 align:start position:0%
neglectful harmful parents are not the
norm

01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
norm
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
rather it is the norm that parents work
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
overtime to protect and provide for
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
and those parents those parents should
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
not have to fear that a government
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
agency who is often not well informed
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
not aware of the dangers of vaccines and
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
who does not love or even know your
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
child could jeopardize your parental
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
rights over this issue
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
or worse could literally take your child
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
or worse could literally take your child
away

01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
while you are desperately trying to
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
protect that child
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the way any fully informed
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
loving parent would
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the way each of you would
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm encouraged and optimistic that this
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
bill is being presented and i look
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing it pass thank you
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh so i i mean this
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
isn't covet specific so
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
that just kind of i i'm
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
more specific on the um
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
on on the i mean currently there are
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines being used
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard of anybody's
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights for not
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting the other vaccines wonderful so
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to identify the problem and
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
the need for this bill
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
i mean has there been termination of
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
parental rights for current vaccine
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
requirements oh i don't know
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i i'm just speaking to the bill
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay great i don't know the history of
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm actually fairly new to new
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i don't yeah
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
up not next is stephen dave's to speak
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
speak uh yes i'm a husband and father of
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
three children
 
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.270 align:start position:0%
three children
um

01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
i personally am
 
01:45:11.679 --> 01:45:12.870 align:start position:0%
i personally am
pro

01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
pro
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
pro choice for vaccines
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
i choose to vaccinate
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
however i would not under any
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
circumstance want somebody's children
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
taking from them from them if a parent
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
chooses to use their right of conscience
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
to not vaccinate their children
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
instead this is something that we can
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
use persuasion rather than coercion to
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
convince them
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
specifically the new hampshire
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
constitution guarantees our right to
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
privacy and our right to conscience
 
01:45:42.639 --> 01:45:44.629 align:start position:0%
privacy and our right to conscience
so

01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's very disheartening
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't support a bill that
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
would infer the rights of the parents
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the rights of families
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
it is the role of government to protect
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
our rights
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
and if if at any point you felt that
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would protect the rights of
 
01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
this bill would protect the rights of
parents

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
then you should support it um however if
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
you feel that it is the role of
 
01:46:05.679 --> 01:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
you feel that it is the role of
government

01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
to have the power to take away people's
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
children from them for doing what is
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
against their conscience
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
then i would please ask that you
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
question your position
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it is the role to protect our
 
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.310 align:start position:0%
because it is the role to protect our
rights

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions go ahead
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
so struck throat is pretty common among
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
young children
 
01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.109 align:start position:0%
young children
and

01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
if it's not treated with antibiotics
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
rheumatic fever which can damage the
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
heart is a potential cause
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
inflammation of the kidneys
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
is another cause
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for parents to
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
exempt their children from
 
01:46:58.639 --> 01:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
exempt their children from
antibiotics

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
antibiotics
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
then when we make a comparison to
 
01:47:04.239 --> 01:47:05.669 align:start position:0%
then when we make a comparison to
vaccinations

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be neglectful to put
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
children in harm's way not to get
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or to get antibiotics or for
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
that matter any medical treatment if the
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
parent so chooses would that be
 
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
parent so chooses would that be
neglectful

01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
neglectful
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
it is definitely moving the goal post
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
off of the bill at hand which is
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
specifically limited about vaccinations
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
um but at the same time this
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
i would challenge you to find parents
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
that don't want the best for their
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
children more so than the people sitting
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
in this room or any rooms in this
 
01:47:39.199 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
in this room or any rooms in this
building

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
parents spend
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
sleepless hours thinking about what's
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
best for their children
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
are do they get it wrong yes sometimes
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
they do personally i'm also against
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
spanking and smacking your children and
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
there has been several countries that
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
have made that illegal as well however
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly legal in all 50 states to
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
hit your children every single day if
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
you don't like what they do and i don't
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
believe anyone on this board thinks that
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
parents should lose their parental
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
rights for spanking
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
but there are several some do right um
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
however many don't i'm sure as you're
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
aware and there are
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
what's that i don't think i said that
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
oh okay i'm sorry right here yeah
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's a difference of opinion right so
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
the same is true for what are the
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
ramifications for medical procedures the
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
same is true for what are the
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
ramifications for smacking and spanking
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
your children there's negative cognitive
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
problems there's behavioral problems
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
that could cause
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
sociopathy right which are
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
societal problems that could result in
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
mass murders mass shootings
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
which are far worse than somebody
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
getting sick and dying because their
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
parents chose not to vaccinate them or
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
give them antibiotics
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that this is the role of
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
medical professionals primary care
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
physicians to talk to parents and for
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
parents to find primary care physicians
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
that they trust as i've done i found
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians that i do trust
 
01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.310 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians that i do trust
and

01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that is how this relationship works
 
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
and that is how this relationship works
so

01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
i hope that answered your question
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i i'm still trying to identify the
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
problem uh with respect to spanking
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are parents that have been
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
terminated uh because they've it was
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
claimed to have been abusive
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so i'm still trying to identify
 
01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
um so i'm still trying to identify
where

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
i mean what i'm hearing is that
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
we should be putting in these bills i i
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't agree with spanking so i should be
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
putting in a bill to stop spanking
 
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
putting in a bill to stop spanking
um

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i i don't uh yeah i i'm just
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
trying to look for where we where this
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill is needed is that you know what
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
what is the problem that this bill needs
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a chance for
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
representatives to stand with parental
 
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.550 align:start position:0%
representatives to stand with parental
rights

01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.350 align:start position:0%
rights
um

01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
most of you some of you may be parents
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
thinking of being parents are
 
01:50:18.639 --> 01:50:19.910 align:start position:0%
thinking of being parents are
grandparents

01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
grandparents
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you have an idea of what
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
you want for your children and your
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and you hold your idea
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
very highly because you've probably
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
thought about it a long time but at the
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
same time if you believe that your
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
neighbor should be doing something you
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with them you tried
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
to persuade them and this gives the
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for persuasion rather than
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
coercion it bans coercion of of dh
 
01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.350 align:start position:0%
coercion it bans coercion of of dh
dhhs

01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
from holding something over a parent's
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
head saying if you don't do this thing
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
that we say
 
01:50:53.599 --> 01:50:54.390 align:start position:0%
that we say
which

01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
may or may not help the child it
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
possibly likely would help them but
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
we're not sure
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and specifically it's it's difficult
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
so if we do reference like the last
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
testimony if we do reference this
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
specific covet vaccination which is i
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
think is probably the motivator for the
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill right more so than any of the other
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations it's difficult to trust the
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies who tell you
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
that there have been zero deaths during
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
trials and then from freedom of
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
information act of requests from
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
december 1st 2020 to february 18th it
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
turns out there were over a thousand
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
people that very likely could have died
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine after previously they
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
said that there were no deaths and then
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
after requesting more evidence from
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
their trials they say it'll take 75
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
years for us to release all the
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
documents to the public
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
so there's there's already this the
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
scenario of protection for
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies specifically
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
passed in 1988 with the child vaccine
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
safety act which prevents pharmaceutical
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
companies from being held personally
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
liable to lawsuits
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's a really weird scenario to think
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
that you can make a product
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
force it on people and then you can't
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
sue them if you're damaged from it
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's very few other industries where
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
the tort claims the right of protection
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
from damages does not exist so
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
specifically that's why this bill should
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
be supported because of the existing
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
legal environment set up in the united
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
states to protect the pharmaceutical
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
companies from from lawsuits
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
much thank you up next we have mary
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
smith who has asked for two minutes or
 
01:52:35.119 --> 01:52:44.950 align:start position:0%
smith who has asked for two minutes or
less

01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairwoman and the committee
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill addresses is that parents
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
have the right as stewards of their
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
children to make medical decisions
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
for their children not the state
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to affirm that basic
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
notion that governments are instituted
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
to safeguard rights not demolish them
 
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.350 align:start position:0%
to safeguard rights not demolish them
to

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
speak to representatives along
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative long's point
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
about what is the need for this bill if
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
there have been no recorded instances of
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's parental rights being taken
 
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.790 align:start position:0%
anyone's parental rights being taken
away

01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
on the basis of
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinate i would say
 
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
vaccinate i would say
that

01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have those
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
figures or numbers in front of me
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
and that's an excellent point and
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
it speaks to
 
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.270 align:start position:0%
it speaks to
the

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
sort of underlying point of the
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that i think other people
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
have tried to communicate
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
adequately and maybe they haven't
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
communicated adequately is
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
we're not sure we don't know
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
but it is evident or clear
 
01:54:02.239 --> 01:54:03.589 align:start position:0%
but it is evident or clear
that

01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
um recently
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
in public discussion has included
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not parents should be
 
01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.830 align:start position:0%
whether or not parents should be
considered

01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.430 align:start position:0%
considered
negligent

01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
negligent
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
in their care of their children if they
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't take steps
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
that would safeguard
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the health and the life of their
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
children and one of those steps could
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
plausibly be vaccinating or not
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinating their children
 
01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.830 align:start position:0%
vaccinating their children
um

01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
given that vaccination can lead to
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
a child
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
not contracting a disease or not
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
contracting a disease as severely as
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
they might without vaccination i think
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is the impetus that is the reason
 
01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.669 align:start position:0%
that is the impetus that is the reason
why

01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
parents are interested in this that this
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill has
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
been submitted that i'm here to testify
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
for it and so were
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
other parents
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
before me
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that clarifies all right
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%

for taking the question
um

01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%

01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%

are going to provide the vaccine to the
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
child are those unusual
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
cases that maybe we would not have seen
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
before covet and therefore this this
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill would not um
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
have come up
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
in less
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
presented uh come to the forefront of of
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
um i guess our societal
 
01:56:20.159 --> 01:56:22.310 align:start position:0%
um i guess our societal
consciousness

01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
consciousness
 
01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
consciousness
uh

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
to answer your question i think the
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:56:30.639 --> 01:56:32.470 align:start position:0%
yes
that

01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:33.750 align:start position:0%
that
this

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
unusual and probably infrequent
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
before kovid but now
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
due to covid and coveted vaccines and
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the controversy and the different
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
feelings that different parents have
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
about what is best for their children
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
that now you are going to be seeing
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
many more instances
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
where you have an entirely plausible
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
case where people can go to the state
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.149 align:start position:0%
like um
[Music]

01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
parents in a dispute can go to the state
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.870 align:start position:0%
and say
well

01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
this parent who i'm fighting against for
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
custody of my child
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
has clearly shown negligence or
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
disregard of the health of my child
 
01:57:15.599 --> 01:57:16.709 align:start position:0%
disregard of the health of my child
because

01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
they have prohibited or blocked us being
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
able to get a vaccine or have them be
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and so it may well be the
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
case as as you pointed out that
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't uh
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
in the public consciousness as as much
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
that these cases may have happened but
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
they may have been infrequent
 
01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.550 align:start position:0%
they may have been infrequent
and

01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
may not have been the cause for
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past but are now
 
01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.910 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past but are now
because

01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
it is such a sticking point it is so
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the top of mind for so many parents
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
and so many legislators so
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
much up next is russ and chester she
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
didn't put how much time but you got
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee members um i just wanted to
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
say that this isn't new
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
when i work for dcyf there are some
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
people for whatever reasons
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
they choose to not want to
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily follow the vaccine process
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
they have been accused of being
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
neglectful and or medical neglect
 
01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:39.910 align:start position:0%
neglectful and or medical neglect
specifically

01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
and they have come to the attention of
 
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
and they have come to the attention of
dcyf

01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
right here in new hampshire in some
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
instances they have a good reason
 
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
instances they have a good reason
but

01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
they still are not always successful so
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
i had one person who is absolutely
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
convinced that her
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
two-year-old round of shots
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
caused autism in her son
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to convince her
 
01:59:05.679 --> 01:59:06.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to convince her
otherwise

01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
she had another baby after like two
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
years later so
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
she refused to get the other one
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated she just wanted she
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
only wanted to spread it out she was
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
still brought up on charges of abuse and
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
neglect she still went through the
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
system her children were put in foster
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
care so this is real
 
01:59:27.679 --> 01:59:28.629 align:start position:0%
care so this is real
um

01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
and yes covid has
 
01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:33.270 align:start position:0%
and yes covid has
opened

01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
opened
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
pulled the curtain back but the other
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
thing that i would say is because
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a lot of statistics
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
because unfortunately child protective
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
services hides behind a veil of
 
01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.270 align:start position:0%

confidentiality
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
that again speaks to it's very easy to
 
01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:49.589 align:start position:0%
that again speaks to it's very easy to
say

01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
oh it's not a big deal in our state
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
because no one can talk about it the
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
other thing is is that i know right now
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
there's there is a situation where and
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
it was with regards to the covert
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine but a parent felt very 50 50
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
custody one parent had
 
02:00:08.159 --> 02:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
custody one parent had
um

02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
felt very strongly that they wanted
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
their child vaccinated the other parent
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
felt very strongly that they did not
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
want their child vaccinated so they
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
brought it to the courts and the judge
 
02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:19.510 align:start position:0%
brought it to the courts and the judge
ruled

02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
ruled
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
that child has now suffered
 
02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
that child has now suffered
some

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:23.690 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:00:23.690 --> 02:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
some
[Music]

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms from the vax from the coven 19
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccination
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's it's going to be
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
temporary or permanent however
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
something like this would protect
 
02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
something like this would protect
um

02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
protect children and parents the bigger
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
thing that i see in that two things
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
where their parents are fighting about
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine issue that child is being
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
that child is being maltreated because
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not able to
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
work with their parents and come up to
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of solution
 
02:00:56.159 --> 02:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
some kind of solution
so

02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
that being said that's the that's why i
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill coming forward because it is
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
something in our state and it goes back
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
to any kind medical treatments if you
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
have a an experimental medical treatment
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know same thing
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion
 
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.229 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion
so

02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for your testimony
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me in new hampshire
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody refusing to get vaccinated
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
is medical neglect and they took their
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
children and put them in foster care
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
that was the case yes
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
that actually happened that was a that
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
real life it hasn't happened recently
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
but we've done so much to deteriorate
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
our parental rights in new hampshire i
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if it's happening
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay today thank you
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
so speaking of parental rights would you
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
not then say that the other parents
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
parental rights are being deteriorated
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
if they choose to have the if they want
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
their child to be vaccinated
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and i agree all right should be
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
considered both parents rights and the
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
children's rights so it is a sticky
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
wicket i'm not saying that child
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
protective services shouldn't have been
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
involved what i'm saying is is that
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
because of because of this type the lack
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
of this statement there's not
 
02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.669 align:start position:0%
of this statement there's not
there's

02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
one parent's rights are being
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
outweighed over the other this would
 
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.589 align:start position:0%
outweighed over the other this would
allow

02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
people to make a decision because in
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
one parent's right they may have a very
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
good reason that that woman had a very
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
good reason for not wanting her child
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you know in this situation
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
the parent that wanted her child
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um they're not involved with
 
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um they're not involved with
dcyf

02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
the parent that wanted the child
 
02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.470 align:start position:0%
the parent that wanted the child
vaccinated

02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
is based on the information she has and
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
the one that did not based on the
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
information they had the appropriate
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
thing would would be to do in that
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
situation is to create a mediation
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
and to try to see if we can come to some
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
kind of an agreement
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yokela
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
question isn't um
 
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.350 align:start position:0%
question isn't um
shouldn't

02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.189 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
um

02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
or doesn't the
 
02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:18.550 align:start position:0%
or doesn't the
decision

02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
about the cost-benefit for each
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
and even the history with the child
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
or or previous children as you as you
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
said um
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
way into the decision of whether or not
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
a a parent might vaccinate their child
 
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:41.350 align:start position:0%
a a parent might vaccinate their child
and

02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe even the timeline for which
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
because it seemed to me that so
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
there has been some discussion about
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
um spreading out the vaccines over of a
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
longer period of time or letting the
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
children choose that at you know an old
 
02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.629 align:start position:0%
children choose that at you know an old
and

02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
an older age might be more appropriate
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
in that individual circumstance
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that should
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
um be
 
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
um be
um

02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
that there is a range of of
 
02:04:17.199 --> 02:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
that there is a range of of
choices

02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
choices
 
02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.750 align:start position:0%
choices
that

02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
argued and valid
 
02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.470 align:start position:0%
argued and valid
and

02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.589 align:start position:0%
it's not
uh

02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't really be a deciding factor
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
about whether or not they the
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
children are removed from the parental
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
care yes thank you and i thank i
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question so the re the
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking on this is because it's the
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
most egregious
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
form of of uh termination of parental
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
rights is devastating it's devastating
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the biological parents it's
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
devastating for the child and it's
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
devastating for even this child
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
protective worker that's been involved
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
so that's why i like that it's just
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for termination of parental
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
rights this doesn't prevent someone by
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
making appropriate decisions for their
 
02:05:09.119 --> 02:05:10.629 align:start position:0%
making appropriate decisions for their
children

02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
nor does it
 
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
nor does it
force

02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
any coercion on either side because you
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
still have that process that you can
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
work through through with the
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights that's
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
after that's after it's been quote
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
unquote proven through the court process
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
that it's not in the best interest of
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
the child to maintain a relationship
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
with that parent
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
like follow-up thank you
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it seems like you're um
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
in that last statement where you're
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
that parental ending terminating the
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
parental rights is essentially saying
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's not in the best interest of the
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
child to
 
02:05:55.119 --> 02:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
child to
be

02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.870 align:start position:0%
be
um

02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
to maintain that maintain that
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
relationship and
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and your your
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
testimony to this committee is um
 
02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.669 align:start position:0%
testimony to this committee is um
that

02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
while that vaccination and decisions
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
about that is
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
is not enough of uh
 
02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.790 align:start position:0%
is not enough of uh
of

02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
a detriment to the child to warrant uh
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
the removal of that relationship
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
vaccination in them itself i do not
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
believe it should be um unfortunately i
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
just think that that's what's happening
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%

or a lifelong
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
change if they've had a
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
a physical
 
03:16:58.800 --> 03:17:00.389 align:start position:0%
a physical

the the rsa or excuse me the bill
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
merely adds a definition to abuse it
 
03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
says if you drugs or physical
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
therapy to your physical changes to a
 
03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
therapy to your physical changes to a
per

03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
per
 
03:17:21.190 --> 03:17:21.200 align:start position:0%

03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay steven scare 111 east hobart street

and i'm here to speak in favor of the
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
the the strongest advocates of putting
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
some some limits on
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
child transgenderism you'll find if you
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
go to the subreddit for people that have
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
gone through d transition and right now
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
it has almost 26 000 members
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and something that they emphasize is
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
you can't tell no one has any way of
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
telling who's going to regret
 
03:18:48.319 --> 03:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
telling who's going to regret
the

03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
what's happening with with the gender
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
blockers or cross-sex surgery or double
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
mastectomies later
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
there there isn't any clear science
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
behind it i realize some people are
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
happy with it
 
03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
they but they repoint point out that
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
being that young they were
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
unable to make informed decisions
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and they tell
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
a common story for young women is that
 
03:19:14.309 --> 03:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
they had trouble fitting in with other
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
girls they didn't fit female stereotypes
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
they were drawn into transgenderism by
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
social media
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
media and peer groups
 
03:19:24.550 --> 03:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then just rushed through
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
medicalization by therapists who didn't
 
03:19:29.670 --> 03:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
who didn't explore other
 
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
one woman
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
laura reynolds
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
she's a detransitioner she has a child
 
03:19:41.190 --> 03:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
now she regrets not being able to
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
breastfeed and of course a change to her
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
voice and some of the other changes to
 
03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
her body
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
she says children don't have free will
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
they'll believe anything if you tell
 
03:19:54.389 --> 03:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
them they can change their sex they'll
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
believe you
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
and just briefly one other reflection
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's running on the subreddit page
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
expressing frustration from someone who
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
went through
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
child transgenderism herself
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
why have trans activists pushed so hard
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
for immediate medicalization of anyone
 
03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
who is experiencing even minor forms of
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
gender discomfort dysphoria encouraging
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
a lifetime of doctors blood tests scans
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
injection surgery even more surgery
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
instead of just trying to talk therapy
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
first would it be ethical to staple the
 
03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
stomach of a 14 year old anorexic shot
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
so they can't get gain any more weight
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
even though there's nothing wrong with
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
them physically and the problem is all
 
03:20:36.960 --> 03:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
them physically and the problem is all
psychological

03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
seems insane but that's exactly what
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
we're doing to trans kids permanent
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
changes from a problem that isn't real
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
that isn't even real a lot of the time
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
sex can never be changed and no matter
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
what surgeries and unhealthy medical
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
procedures you do to people it will
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
never come close to the bodies given to
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
us at birth
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
yet we throw all that away because of a
 
03:21:01.830 --> 03:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
thought that we were born in the wrong
 
03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
thought that we were born in the wrong
body

03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
how can it be wrong if it's perfectly
 
03:21:07.750 --> 03:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
healthy and functions by itself without
 
03:21:10.150 --> 03:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
need for medical intervention doesn't
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for this
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.630 --> 03:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
up next is chris urchill
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%

03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%

and i'm here today to speak in
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
opposition to hp 1651 i'd like to start
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
by drawing the committee's attention to
 
03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
house rule 36e
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
which states very clearly in the second
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
year session no bill or resolution shall
 
03:22:06.150 --> 03:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
be introduced if it is substantially
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
similar to any legislation that was um
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postponed or voted in
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
by the house in the first year session
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is identical
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
identical indistinguishable from hb68
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
which was introduced last year and it is
 
03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
in blatant flagrant violation of the
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
house rules thank you for bringing that
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
to my attention i didn't even think of
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
that because the whole you know the
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
whole first year was
 
03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
very confusing um so thank you for
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
bringing that to my attention you're
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
welcome um
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to go on to say
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
that uh transgender people in our
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
community um they're assets to our
 
03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:45.830 align:start position:0%
community um they're assets to our
community

03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
they are our neighbors they are um
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
parents they're participants in our
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
workplaces and our communities and our
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
libraries they volunteer they are
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
friends they're family they're
 
03:22:57.760 --> 03:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
friends they're family they're
everywhere

03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um they can be they can be really
 
03:23:03.510 --> 03:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
productive and helpful and wonderful
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
contributing members of our community
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
but only if they have the tools that
 
03:23:09.510 --> 03:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
they need to succeed and if we deny them
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
those tools to be successful happy
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
healthy contributing members of our
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
society when they're children they have
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
little chance of being successful as
 
03:23:17.359 --> 03:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
little chance of being successful as
adults

03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
adults
 
03:23:21.429 --> 03:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is a serious medical
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
condition it's widely accepted by every
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
single medical
 
03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
organization in the country
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
and in the world in fact um that that
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria it's i don't need to
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
rely on a subreddit to to to make my
 
03:23:37.349 --> 03:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
case every major medical association
 
03:23:39.510 --> 03:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
agrees that gender dysphoria is a very
 
03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
serious but very treatable medical
 
03:23:41.439 --> 03:23:42.389 align:start position:0%
serious but very treatable medical
condition

03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
um the the the um sorry the condition
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
manifests because of an incongruence
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
between a person's assigned sex at birth
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
and their gender identity um
 
03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
treatment for gender dysphoria oh so
 
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
sorry not just any discomfort with one's
 
03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
gender qualifies as uh clinically
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosed gender dysphoria there's
 
03:24:04.630 --> 03:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
criteria that are laid out in the dsm-5
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's been available for years to any
 
03:24:09.190 --> 03:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner to understand what the
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
diagnostic criteria are when someone's
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gender dysphoria there's
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
medical standards of care that are
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
applied to treat somebody with that
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
condition and those include different
 
03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:20.229 align:start position:0%
condition and those include different
forms

03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
forms
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
different forms of treatment which which
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
vary from social transition like using a
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
different name pronouns um in in
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
different settings dressing a certain
 
03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
way uh there's hormonal treatments
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's surgical treatments there's also
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
legal avenues that people can take to
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
get updated identification documents to
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
reflect who they are all of those are
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
under the general umbrella of of gender
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
transition which is treatment for gender
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
dysphoria it's extremely effective um
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
and every single medical organization
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
agrees i'm not a doctor so i'm not
 
03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
speaking from that perspective but i can
 
03:24:55.269 --> 03:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that there is no major
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
medical association that disagrees that
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is highly treatable and
 
03:25:01.830 --> 03:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
the treatment is uh
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
gender transition which this bill would
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
turn into a criminal act um so so it's
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's um it's such an extreme way to
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
to react to that at the same time that
 
03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're having this hearing in an hour
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be um a hearing to
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
on a bill by the same sponsor to repeal
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
the ban on conversions okay but we're
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're sticking to this one yeah yes you
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
know i understand i'm bringing it up
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
because the conversion therapy ban that
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
this uh that this legislature passed
 
03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 was meant to address the
 
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
fact that there are people who to this
 
03:25:38.550 --> 03:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
day despite mounds of evidence um you
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
know to the contrary there are people
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
who who to this day believe that the
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
correct way to treat transgender and gay
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
youth is to try to convince them or
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
force them to change their gender
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
identity or change their sexual
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
orientation that persists to this day
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that's just what this bill is is is
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
is manifesting right now and just for
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
broader context we are in the midst of a
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
massive attack on transgender youth
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
bills in every single state legislature
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
that are aimed at harming transgender
 
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
youth and this is just one more of them
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
and um i hope that this committee votes
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
decisively like you did last year 15 to
 
03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
nothing unanimous it i hope that happens
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
again this year

hampshire's connect suicide program
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's a program that's been designed as a

the national prevention lifeline as well
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire's legislatively
 
03:34:28.960 --> 03:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire's legislatively
established

suicide prevention council
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide the background
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
about the extensive
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge that nami new hampshire does
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
for individuals in our state that are
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
ages 10 to 34 suicide is the second
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it's only the tip of the iceberg
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
when you're you know looking at suicide
 
03:35:00.319 --> 03:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
when you're you know looking at suicide
attempts

03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the human and economic impacts of
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths and attempts is is very
 
03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.150 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths and attempts is is very
significant

03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
a very a small but important
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
subgroup of
 
03:35:17.190 --> 03:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
are people that
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
deal are dealing with gender identity
 
03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:22.630 align:start position:0%
deal are dealing with gender identity
issues

03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
and there's an emerging body of research
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's showing showing that trans uh
 
03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
that's showing showing that trans uh
people

03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
are less likely to attempt suicide
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
i got that completely backwards they are
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
more likely to attempt suicide
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
than their peers in the general
 
03:35:39.359 --> 03:35:42.389 align:start position:0%
than their peers in the general
population

03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
young people who are non-gender
 
03:35:44.080 --> 03:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
young people who are non-gender
conforming

03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
conforming
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
are also at a higher risk
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
a 2021 study indicated that people who
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
go undergo hormone therapy or gender
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
have significant reductions in
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
psychological distress including
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
there have been previous studies on
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
suicide rates of individuals who
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
identify as
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh transgender
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
that show that some of the unique
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
um to this pot to
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
that this this this population faces one
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
of those factors is a lack of family and
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
adding hormone therapy and gender
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery to the definition of
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
child abuse takes away a parent's right
 
03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
to support their child as they see fit
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
as i you know previously stated
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
a lack of family supports contributes to
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
the increased risk of suicide
 
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
in young and the young transgender
 
03:36:50.479 --> 03:36:52.229 align:start position:0%
in young and the young transgender
population

03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
and if passed house bill 1651
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be harmful to the mental health of
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
and as i previously mentioned
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
in those studies it is likely to lead to
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
an increased risk of depression suicide
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
and suicide attempts
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
and because nami new hampshire is
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
committed to addressing suicide as a
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
public health issue and reducing the
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
incidence of suicide thoughts attempts
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
and deaths
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
we respectfully urge that this committee
 
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate on
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you for taking my
 
03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:32.710 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you for taking my
testimony

03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%

03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
up next is emma savini to speak in
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill she does have
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:38:12.870 --> 03:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairperson and honorable
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is emma
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
savini i am the children's behavioral
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
health policy coordinator at new futures
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
new futures is a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates educates and
 
03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
collaborates to improve the health and
 
03:38:29.830 --> 03:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
wellness of all granite staters
 
03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
new future strongly opposes house bill
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
1651 because it creates a disincentive
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
for parents to seek medically necessary
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially life-saving treatment
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
for their children and youth by labeling
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
that treatment as abuse
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment therapy is not child
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
abuse and this bill would have
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
far-reaching and devastating

children and families to understand the

far-reaching implications it's important
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
to distinguish between the terms sex and
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
gender sex is typically referred to as a
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
combination of physical characteristics
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
typical of males or females on the other

person's internal sense of being male
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
female or for some people a blend of

both or neither
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
further still gender expression is how
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
one of them how people choose to
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
express their gender to others such as

clothing haircuts and other

03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
some children show a great deal of
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
distress when they are
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
forced to
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
conform to the gender roles
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%

03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
speakers have spoke on today

03:39:56.790 --> 03:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
strongly endorses the use of gender
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
affirming care when treating children
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
who are suffering from gender dysphoria

um gen
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
depending on the child's age and the
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
level of distress they're in
 
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
gender affirming therapy can be um
 
03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
a range of treatments it can range from
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know talk therapy as men mentioned
 
03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
or it can
 
03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
range all the way to gender transition
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note that before a
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
child reaches puberty gender transition
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
is typically limited to just those
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
social changes such as using different
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
pronouns allowing a child to express
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
their gender through clothing haircuts
 
03:40:40.319 --> 03:40:43.429 align:start position:0%
their gender through clothing haircuts
etc

03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
after puberty if a child
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
continues to go through gender affirming
 
03:40:48.239 --> 03:40:49.429 align:start position:0%
continues to go through gender affirming
care

03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's important to have early
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
interventions in that care to
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the negative effects that have
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
been mentioned by nami
 
03:41:00.229 --> 03:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
rejecting a child's gender identity and
 
03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
denying them gender affirming care
 
03:41:04.389 --> 03:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
leaves them at risk for
 
03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
an increased risk for depression

nami mentioned suicidality
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
suicidality is one of the most serious
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
elevated health risks facing gender

transgender people
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
again the american academy of pediatric
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
pediatrics emphasizes that discouraging
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
or shaming a child's gender identity or
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
expression can harm a child's social
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
emotional health and well-being and may
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
have lifelong consequences
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
early intervention and treatment can
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
combat those negative implications
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
while gender affirming hormone therapy
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
is what we traditionally think of as
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
every child is unique and treatment can
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
vary from individual to individual those
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
decisions should be left to the child
 
03:41:57.750 --> 03:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
the child's parents and the medical
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
professionals treating that child
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
by adding this uh gender affirming
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
treatment to child abuse you're removing
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
that parent's ability that child's
 
03:42:11.349 --> 03:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
ability and the medical team's ability
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
to make decisions that could have like
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
lifelong implications on that child's
 
03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:15.830 align:start position:0%
lifelong implications on that child's
life

03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%

treatment for children transgender youth
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
and families could lead to more costs
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the state in the long run because
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
the state will have to pick up the bill
 
03:42:27.910 --> 03:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
for children who have those lifelong
 
03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:29.590 align:start position:0%
for children who have those lifelong
consequences

03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:42:31.189 --> 03:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
we should be supporting our youth to
 
03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
achieve physical and mental well-being
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
instead of creating barriers and
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
dampening access to medically necessary

03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
population for those reasons new futures
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
strongly urges the committee to vote
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 1651 itl i'm happy to take
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
03:42:57.269 --> 03:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
up next is jennifer smith to speak in
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony um
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll be shorter than three minutes
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
given all the other testimony um
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
i have sent you an email this morning
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
with a brief testimony but i just wanted
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
to kind of rebut some stuff make make
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
things clear i am transgender
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
i know lots of parents of transgendered
 
03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:28.950 align:start position:0%
i know lots of parents of transgendered
children

03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
nobody is rushing anybody into anything
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
i also know gender therapists
 
03:43:34.239 --> 03:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
i also know gender therapists
so

03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that was
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
put out there
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be lots of regrets
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's only one good study about regret
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
from the european union where a lot of
 
03:43:49.510 --> 03:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment has occurred
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
and they found in a very large sample
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
four percent with regrets
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
those regrets were not because they
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
weren't transgender it was because they
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't find social acceptance
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're difficult sometimes
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
i was pretty fortunate that even though
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
i struggled with it there were some
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
other aspects of my life that made it
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
easier and in the 1950s and 60s
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
it was all called transsexual and i knew
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that cause i'm attracted to
 
03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:19.830 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that cause i'm attracted to
women

03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
women
 
03:44:19.840 --> 03:44:21.189 align:start position:0%
women
so

03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:24.070 --> 03:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know it it's kind of and i'm also
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
very athletic and very competitive and
 
03:44:27.670 --> 03:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
those things were things that you
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
weren't supposed to be if you were a
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
girl so even though i felt from earliest
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
times that i can remember
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
desire to dress in girls clothes
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
to play with the girls
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
i got schooled into being different and
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
i succeeded because of those other
 
03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:45.349 align:start position:0%
i succeeded because of those other
things

03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:44:48.150 --> 03:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
i have relatives who
 
03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
have transgender children
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the thought that they're allowing a
 
03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:53.189 align:start position:0%
the thought that they're allowing a
child

03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
to keep up with peers in
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
high school
 
03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
by going on hormone therapy would be
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
class child abuse even though
 
03:45:03.590 --> 03:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
this was
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
something that was approved by
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
medical doctors and therapists after
 
03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:09.349 align:start position:0%
medical doctors and therapists after
careful

03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
careful
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes talk therapy
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
making sure that this was not some
 
03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
strange thing for a psychotic
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
young person
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
those things do happen i happen to have
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
practiced at new hampshire hospital as a
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
part-time physician part of my career
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
there are some psychotic individuals who
 
03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
for some reason get a fixed illusion
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
around gender
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to have the usual
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of gender dysphoria
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
unusual both among mentally ill people
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
and among the rest of the population who
 
03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
have gender dysphoria
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
and i know a lot of people with gender
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
dysphoria at this point
 
03:45:50.640 --> 03:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
dysphoria at this point
so

03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i think you know
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
the issue of well it never got voted on
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
last year so i guess they're treating it
 
03:45:59.590 --> 03:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
like it had been tabled and you're
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring back a table bill in
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
the second year of the biennium that's
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
all i could figure
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
it didn't get voted on there were a
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
number of bills at the end of the
 
03:46:09.199 --> 03:46:10.389 align:start position:0%
number of bills at the end of the
session

03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:46:13.990 --> 03:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
that never got brought to the floor
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:46:15.359 --> 03:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
so i
right

03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
i do hope that you will repeat last year
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
and put it on the consent calendar
 
03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:24.469 align:start position:0%
and put it on the consent calendar
itl

03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
itl
 
03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that we will be done with the
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
nonsense again until the next
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
session and maybe this particular rep
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
who doesn't seem to have anyone else who
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
wants to bring the bill with him
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
won't even be here who knows
 
03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:39.189 align:start position:0%
won't even be here who knows
so

03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
please i tell this bill
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
up next is anna mcpherson
 
03:47:03.510 --> 03:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
my name is anna macpherson however
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is my legal name at school and a
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
lot of my other clubs i go by andrew
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
i am a transgender strange gender
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%

school
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm here instead to
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because if
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
when i heard of this bill i had to leave
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
my class to cry because if this bill got
 
03:47:29.279 --> 03:47:30.309 align:start position:0%
my class to cry because if this bill got
passed

03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
i would not be able to
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
have surgery that would make my life way
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
more fulfilling as a transgender
 
03:47:36.880 --> 03:47:42.550 align:start position:0%
more fulfilling as a transgender
individual

03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
as of for detransitioners
 
03:47:48.870 --> 03:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have come up to me and
 
03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:50.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have come up to me and
wondered

03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
wondered
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
not wondered um a lot of people have
 
03:47:55.229 --> 03:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
questioned me about
 
03:47:58.150 --> 03:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
detransitioners and according to a study
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
of two that twenty eight thousand people
 
03:48:00.319 --> 03:48:01.990 align:start position:0%
of two that twenty eight thousand people
surveyed

03:48:01.990 --> 03:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
surveyed
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
who were transgender eight percent of
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
them had de-transitioned at some point
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
but uh sixty-two percent of the eight
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
percent had only temporarily
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
detransitioned and a lot of that happens
 
03:48:12.479 --> 03:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
detransitioned and a lot of that happens
before

03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
sex reassignment surgery
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
um so like more social transitioning
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
where then they can
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
go back to
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
being on track to getting their body as
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
their mind
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
their body corresponding to their mind
 
03:48:27.439 --> 03:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
their body corresponding to their mind
um

03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah like yeah you're doing a great job
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't be nervous this is the first time
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
i've ever done this so you're doing
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:43.590 --> 03:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
transgender people both
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
on the binary
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
and gender non gender non-conforming
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
face a higher risk of suicide and
 
03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
face a higher risk of suicide and
self-harm

03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
self-harm
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
i should know i have self-harmed
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
um i have no of i have a lot of friends
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
who are both lgbt and
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
homosexual and transgender transgender
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of them
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
they're the reason i
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
was able to socially transition in a lot
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
of aspects of my life they were the
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
reason i was able to come out to my
 
03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
reason i was able to come out to my
parents

03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
my dad is here with me today also in
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and i'm super
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
super super thankful for that
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
and to say that he could get arrested
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
because it would be illegal for me to
 
03:49:24.399 --> 03:49:25.189 align:start position:0%
because it would be illegal for me to
get

03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
drugs that would make my
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
to make my body match my mind is
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely ridiculous
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
and if we're worried about what drugs
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're injecting into children i
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to take my anxiety
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
medications i shouldn't be able to take
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
tylenol or any other drugs because
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're going into my body and it's
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to create a chemical imbalance
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
the anxiety medication helps me live my
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
life and if starting testosterone which
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
is what trans trans men and trans boys
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
go on to make their voice deeper
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
and change their body a little is going
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
to make my life more fulfilling
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be legal thank you
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for andrew
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%

father
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
the thought that sexual reassignment
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
surgery can be considered abuse to me
 
03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
surgery can be considered abuse to me
is

03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
i don't even know i don't even know
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's a word to describe it to me
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
personally i don't know that there's a
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
bigger sign of love that a parent can
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
give to their child than to have an
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
educated decision with a medical with
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
medical professionals of this is the
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
right course that we need to take for
 
03:50:51.760 --> 03:50:52.790 align:start position:0%
right course that we need to take for
you

03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's not abuse it's love and i'm just
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
going to leave it at that thank you
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
