start for our
um

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're each mission one person no I know
 
00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is here
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
will be along very shortly I've asked
 
00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan is will not be here
 
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
but I've asked for a replacement I
 
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
haven't been notified that there will be
 
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
one so we'll do what we can
 
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.930 align:start position:0%
um
there's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
looks like it's absolutely the same as
 
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.990 align:start position:0%
looks like it's absolutely the same as
um

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
as the house version representative
 
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
Broder thank you I had a question in the
 
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
Senate version the reference to RSA 310a
 
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
let me just make sure what page are you
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
on I'm on page 12.
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 310a colon 1-e was removed from the
 
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
Senate version
 
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
and that was in the house version which
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
is where we I thought put the
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's because House Bill 655 deleted
 
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 310a1
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
okay so all right what version are you
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
looking at we're looking at the side by
 
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
side prepared by our researcher right
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
but I set you on page 12. I'm on page 12
 
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
of a side by side page 11 is side by
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
side all of the side by side sorry
 
00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
excuse me gotcha I was looking in the
 
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill my apology that's okay you have the
 
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
side by side
 
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.550 align:start position:0%
side by side
yeah

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
and yes can I I'd like to
 
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.649 align:start position:0%
and yes can I I'd like to
um

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.630 align:start position:0%
um
also

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
in in these house version I mean the
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
Senate version I'm sorry you added a um
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph had to do with exemptions for
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
Physicians licensing license out of
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
state was that an amendment that I I
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
think the house saw that Amendment but
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
did we add it to another bill I thought
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
we added it to another that language I
 
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 align:start position:0%
believe is in
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
409 or something similar this is the
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
this is in the Physicians and surgeons
 
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
scope of practice
 
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we're not
 
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we're not
um

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
so the language I'm just trying to get
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
to where you are that was paged side by
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
side page 13. section
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
um eight of the Senate version of the
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill yep
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
so that language was language that
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald had put in and we
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
originally heard it as an amendment to
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
409 but we moved it into 532.
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
so it that language is not informal even
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
though it was introduced in the uh
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
actually was it was important yeah I
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
think we did it as a number I think we
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
we put it into a Senate bill that's
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
right we added it to a Senate bill which
 
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 align:start position:0%
is why I'm we don't want to duplicate
 
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.969 align:start position:0%
is why I'm we don't want to duplicate
efforts

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
so we we moved a few things around there
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
at the end and no
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
I don't did you you added this language
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
into a Senate bill I believe it was two
 
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
I might have 207 here I do but I thought
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
207 was mostly their their Appeals it
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
had a lot of other odds in them too okay
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's either 207 or one or so
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh looks like 107. I'll just say I think
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
107.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
I do not have 107 with me here
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
listen

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
as part of that whole amendment that uh
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then we separated
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
no it's not in 107 because
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
I wrote the amendment for 107.
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
and that Amendment came the same day
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing House Bill 105
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
so we didn't put it into 107. okay
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
all right I mean I'm starting this is
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
all starting because we've seen this so
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
many times I can't remember where it
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
except that
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
someplace we put it in
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
relative to telemedicine
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
was it the bill that had to do with the
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections that was a
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
different experience it was a different
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.309 align:start position:0%
yes
126.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
okay okay Senator Bill 120s
 
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
I don't think so that's just that's the
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe it just didn't I don't it
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
didn't get added
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
apparently not we considered it half a
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
dozen times we've seen this many times
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember I don't remember
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't write an amendment and I know
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
for Edna in the house to add it to
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
anything but I just and I I guess I'm
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that because you originally
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to put it in 409 that that's where
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
it was and I didn't want it to be in two
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
different places but you did not include
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
this in 409 and you throw nine I think
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
at the last minute we took it out of
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
four nine and put it in 532. I know we
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
put together a non-germaine amendment
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
that had a lot of stuff in it and we
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
just tagged it to 409 and then we
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
parched things out and separated them
 
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.230 align:start position:0%
parched things out and separated them
accordingly

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so that may be the confusion
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
well we saw it several times okay
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
um and I know you had a different way
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
you wanted to structure it but I just
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if we saw that language well
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
at some point we had a revision to the
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
Telehealth statute itself that said
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
you could continue a relationship yes
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that was in the house
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
let's look at the amendment to House
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
Bill six
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment to House Bill 655
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
oh no that's what we attached to Senate
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 409 right right right right so it's
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
not in there
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
well I'll just check the last version I
 
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.970 align:start position:0%
well I'll just check the last version I
have

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
could I ask
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
um Mr ostern how the this question
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
because I believe okay
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
I believe I asked him this question I
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure were you able
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at is the side by
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
side by 532 and um the last page 13
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
Section 8 which is a new paragraph from
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
the Senate Amendment
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's side by side the last page
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
11 I mean 13. that's really the only I
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
just we just want to make sure that we
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
didn't stick this someplace else and
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
then we're going to duplicate
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
it would have been if we put it it would
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
have been in a Senate bill
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes and we would have put I thought I
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
thought the I'm almost positive that all
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
the components of House Bill 655 that
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
were the leftovers
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
and anything that we want to add to oplc
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
was added as an amendment to 409.
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
from our side
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
so if it wasn't a time no no Senate Bill
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
409 sorry Senate Bill 409 so if it's not
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
in there there isn't a Senate bill for
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
so that would have been
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
with us that we've done
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
them right
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
and that would have been 107 or
 
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.750 align:start position:0%
and that would have been 107 or
um

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.730 align:start position:0%
um
207

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
207
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
were the two bills that we sent over and
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
I don't see it in either of them I'm
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
quite certain that this language
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
originated in the Senate from Senator
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald you're correct it did yes it
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
did and we heard about it when we were
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with Senate bills so if we
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
passed it it would have been in the
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay we you know we went over this
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
amendment to 409 a detailing committee
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we separated this language out we
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
put it into 532 out of 409 right
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
do you have an answer to that well
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
that's the way I recall it too because I
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
think when Senator Rosenwald introduced
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
this as Senate Edna it wasn't a
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
different bill but the language just got
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
picked up and shifted around when 409
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and 532 were sort of being tweaked at
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
the end but I don't think
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
at least I haven't seen it up here in a
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
separate place so I think this is the
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
only place my recollection is she
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
originally came in with the language of
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted it in 655. yes and I didn't want
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
to make a amendment to 655 where I
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
pushed it all into 409 and 532. that's
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
how I remember it too and then the other
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
fixes to telemedicine we just did by
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
adding like RSA 328d and you know like
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
we just added statute references so that
 
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any other language on
 
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.930 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any other language on
telemedicine

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems as though it is it is not a
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
were there any other changes to the
 
00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:36.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
ly I thought we added a position for
 
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
ly I thought we added a position for
oplc

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
that was in the fiscal note to um it was
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
actually in the house bill
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
no one it's if you look on the side by
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
side page 12 one program Assistant two
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
position labor grade 15. there was a
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
position in HP 30 37 that was added
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
after I testified
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday morning okay so maybe
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
I've got the two mixed up in my head I
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
was thinking it was this bill that we
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
added one to that one is attached to
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
house bill 337. yeah right the attorney
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
too he's right okay this one's this
 
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.180 align:start position:0%
one's a looks like a licensing Clerk
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
different position they were entire
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
places I guess I was we had too many
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
bills and I'm remembering the wrong
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
thing I had a lot of oplc yes well yes
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we uh put the
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
OLS can reconcile the uh yes the
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
references because that's that's
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
definitely a concern
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh so since we can't find the
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
language the Telehealth language
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere else yep it's I I can't object
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
do you want a motion do we need to
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
motion or do we just have to agree
 
00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
motion or do we just have to agree
um

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
be a thermal or informal as you as you
 
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.069 align:start position:0%
be a thermal or informal as you as you
like

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
all right I'm in agreement with the
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
with the Senate
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
I agree also okay any uh you're in
 
00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:20.329 align:start position:0%
I agree also okay any uh you're in
agreements

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
I will write a report saying so and uh
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
all right great thank you
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
all right so we are we in an adjournment
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
um good morning good morning
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 409 was
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
the house version is completely gone
 
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.450 align:start position:0%
the house version is completely gone
so

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
like the Senate to convince us that we
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
should adopt your version
 
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:39.740 align:start position:0%
right now because it's really good
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator that's an excellent
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
start there are some sections we'd like
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
a bit more detail on so um House Bill
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
409 came about we used it as a vehicle
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
for all of the changes that we found
 
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to house bill
 
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.070 align:start position:0%
necessary to house bill
uh

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
six fifty five and 594 if we had any
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
change so we wanted to pass those two
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
clean as they came over from the house
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
so that they could just go right through
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then we used uh 409 and the last one
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
that we just did on the music therapy is
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
sort of two vehicles for putting the
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
changes that we found we needed out of
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
the committee so um there are a lot of
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
changes I guess it might be easier to go
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
just to the points that you have some
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
some issues with rather than going
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
through the whole bill if that makes
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
sense right
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
um unless somebody has a concern about
 
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.389 align:start position:0%
um unless somebody has a concern about
the

00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh temper conditional definition of a
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
regulated social worker which I
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
okay the temporary license for medical
 
00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:44.990 align:start position:0%
okay the temporary license for medical
imaging

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
imaging
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
no problem the Board of Nursing we want
 
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.810 align:start position:0%
no problem the Board of Nursing we want
to

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.190 align:start position:0%
to
have

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
two advanced practice registered nurses
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
instead of one
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's at the top of page one of the
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
bill which the version we have isn't
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
and we want to delete the change to the
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
following paragraph
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
that has a
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
nurse member of the board specifically
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
representing nursing education
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
because we feel that's a conflict of
 
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.470 align:start position:0%
because we feel that's a conflict of
interest

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
I need to get to the right copy of the
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
bill here that we're on would you like
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
our copy of our side by side is that
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
this one here
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay are you referring to that or
 
00:34:33.609 --> 00:34:33.619 align:start position:0%
the bill itself I'm
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is included in the back
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
of that package oh okay I got you I
 
00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right there's no numbers no
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
okay at the top of the right hand page
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha okay
 
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.530 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha okay
uh

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
2A prns
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's a big board but there are something
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
like 30 000 nurses and that board has
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
not had any trouble getting a quorum
 
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.170 align:start position:0%
not had any trouble getting a quorum
um

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're in favor of going to 13 people
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we since they don't have a problem
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
like I don't see any objection to that
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that bill is one that board is when
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
you'd send it over at 12 to us and I
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
added a 13th member because I don't like
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
even numbered boards and so we have
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable position yeah so we
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
added a an LNA to that and what you're
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
proposing is to remove the
 
00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:51.589 align:start position:0%
proposing is to remove the
um

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
the nursing education requirement and
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
change that to an APR am I correct um
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes the simplest way to do that is to
 
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.609 align:start position:0%
yes the simplest way to do that is to
change

00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
it says on the top line of that page six
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
registered nurses two of whom shall be
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
in APRN
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay and then delete the new language at
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
um that language concerning nursing
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
education is language that I had brought
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
in there was a group of nurses and I
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
can't remember what their title are of
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Nurses
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
Association they had been looking at the
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
activities of the board and one of the
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
things that they had requested was that
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
we have one nurse dedicated just for
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
nursing education and so that's why
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
Vince is put in there and they had
 
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
recommended that they had the minimum of
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
a master's degree or health related
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
field at least five years of educational
 
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
field at least five years of educational
experience

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding and I think we
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
had had it during testimony that they do
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
have one nurse who works with education
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
on the board but that is not her sole
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
purpose and or her
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the position it's not a dedicated
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
position and so what they were hoping to
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
get would be somebody from a nursing
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
education program
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
um to be on the board
 
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
um to be on the board
representative

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
Mike and our concerned with that is that
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
that person could be biased towards
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
their program and it's not a
 
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.250 align:start position:0%
their program and it's not a
um

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
would have conflict of interest so
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't want someone with
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
associated with nursing program on the
 
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:55.310 align:start position:0%
associated with nursing program on the
board

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
from our hearing where the conflicts
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
made a little more sense to me which I'm
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
happy to share but basically this board
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
of nursing they they certify the
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
educational programs and so they act in
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a regulatory capacity to these
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
institutions and so that could
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
create a conflict of interest but in
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
addition during that process there's
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
non-public information that's shared
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
about some of the education programs and
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
so competitors could have access to some
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
of that non-public information so when I
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
listened to it again it just it made
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
sense to me that perhaps putting this
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
this education person on the board had
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences so I just I
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
want to share that with you yeah that
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
helps we the there's a new paragraph
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
allowing the board to establish
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees in particular an education
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that would focus on the the
 
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that would focus on the the
approvals

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
approvals
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a better way to
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
handle it than to have a member from a
 
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:00.500 align:start position:0%
training education program on the board
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
specifically as such okay there's
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's no you know there's no
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
restriction on how the other nurses are
 
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.670 align:start position:0%
restriction on how the other nurses are
chosen

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
and across on how do you feel about that
 
00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:19.790 align:start position:0%
and across on how do you feel about that
change

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
the the only thing is you know I and it
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
does say in here
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
um a practice and education committee so
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully the Board of Nursing will
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
establish an education subcommittee and
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
they the individuals that will be on it
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
will be able to do the job
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the this organization was just really
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
really concerned about
 
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.569 align:start position:0%
really concerned about
um

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
education of nurses and making sure
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
everything is up to date and
 
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.589 align:start position:0%
everything is up to date and
um

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with it okay I think as long as
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
as they get there I think that will be
 
00:39:58.619 --> 00:39:59.450 align:start position:0%
as they get there I think that will be
fine

00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay all right so it sounds like we'll
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
accept your change of making that two so
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
what in the very top line you're
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
proposing to put instead of one of whom
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
she'll be an advanced it'd be two of who
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't know if that's
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
grammatically correct two of them is
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then there'll be advanced
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
practice and then we'd be uh deleting
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
the new language in section two yes that
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right does anyone have any
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
other comments on the the
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we had received an email and I'm not
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
sure if
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
um you folks said also concerning
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
um some changes with the board of
 
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.329 align:start position:0%
um some changes with the board of
Optometry

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay Optometry I have not received that
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
either okay if you continue that it I
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
didn't see it if I did this is about the
 
00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:01.099 align:start position:0%
continuing education and this section
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
deletes the requirement that the
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
continuing education be reported
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
annually correct um the email and I'm
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
showing it to my colleagues
 
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
showing it to my colleagues
um

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh let's see oh this was way back and
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're happy with deleting that
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
requirement I don't think we fixed it so
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
we fixed this okay
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
my apologies I thought you were looking
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
at something new in committee yes we did
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
address that okay I thought so that this
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
is not part of the changes of 409 or
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's already in it's already been
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
changed and we're talking about
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven right Optometry yes yes
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
we've accepted the word annually it's in
 
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven actually Senator okay
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
yep I'm sorry okay good
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
so further concerns that the house had
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the well can we talk about number
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
five barbering
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
because originally 409 was about
 
00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.490 align:start position:0%
because originally 409 was about
barbering

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
barbering
 
00:41:59.770 --> 00:41:59.780 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
actually this is similar to what's
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
what's in hospital
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
654 which we retained our committee
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
retained that bill right this doesn't
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
do most of what 644 does it simply
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
by Crossing out a sub paragraph B
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
it deletes the booth license
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
which is a request of the Board of
 
00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
which is a request of the Board of
Cosmetology

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
and didn't we do that in hospital too
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
no no we didn't do it okay so this is
 
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
strictly to do with Booth licenses right
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
okay I'm out that's fine yeah please
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
um my understanding representative is
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
that we kept your language but we did
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
delete in our committee Amendment the
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
original language of 409. concerning
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
barbering so we kept I'm sorry can you
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
repeat that we kept the house
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
language the amendment that we wrote to
 
00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:02.030 align:start position:0%
language the amendment that we wrote to
409

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
409
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is what you originally got
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
my confused matters I'll just State
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
clearly what I am sure of which is that
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
um in our committee Amendment we did
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
delete the original text of
 
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:17.660 align:start position:0%
409 yes 409 was originally only about
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
reciprocity of licenses and 594 covers
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
that more broadly okay all right okay
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
great thank you I'm fine yep okay so
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're good
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
the professional licensor and
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
certification fund is revised in Senate
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 I believe but that is set to
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
take effect after this bill I think
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
let's check the I'd have to look at that
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that it is in fact
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
after that this so that it overwrites it
 
00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:16.940 align:start position:0%
okay what are we on which page of the
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
document are we on
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
six eight ten I think
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
it's uh middle of the left-hand page
 
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:31.940 align:start position:0%
it's the funding section
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
separate

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
wrap some stores to help we know the
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.849 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:02.540 align:start position:0%
is and is the 5 million dollars the same
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
no it's that I yeah I hear it five I
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
thought it had been taken down to three
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
right uh that's what Senate Bill 49 does
 
00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:12.309 align:start position:0%
right uh that's what Senate Bill 49 does
okay

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 49 is effective on passage
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
um if we need to we want to make sure
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
so we need to make sure that the
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
governor has assigned 49 until after he
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
signs this one yes
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
can we just change it if it's to match
 
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:45.260 align:start position:0%
the numbers instead of yeah
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
that would be simpler let's just make
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure we do that so we don't you know
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
depending on somebody to sign something
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
sometime is representative I think Mr
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
also helped me have a comedy is to make
 
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.809 align:start position:0%
also helped me have a comedy is to make
you

00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir I've been working with LBA on
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
this one and I I think because of the
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
way 655 and 409 with the July 1
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
um they draw that number from June 30th
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
so if 49 doesn't get signed before June
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
30th oplc will lapse all the funds
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
kind of nullifying both of them so the
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
way they're explaining it to me now is
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
that and we've this is kind of a
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
complicated issue when we've been
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
working with them on it so 655 creates
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
the July 1 for the 5 million 49 would
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
effective upon signing our passage
 
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.750 align:start position:0%
effective upon signing our passage
um

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
would be to delete
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
that paragraph from 409 so that it
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't overwrite Senate bill 49.
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct I don't know because 655
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
still has the July 1 effective date and
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're saying that is the piece that
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
well we can't change Senate Bill 49
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
because it's concurred we can however
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
encourage someone to delay it
 
00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:16.990 align:start position:0%
encourage someone to delay it
foreign

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
I suppose you could do a later effective
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
date on this so that you have 49 go into
 
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:25.940 align:start position:0%
effect on passage July 1 655 language
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
comes up and then here July 2nd
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
you could replace
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
six out of 549 we don't want this
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
language to overwrite right Senate
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
before could you make this language
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
match the language of 49. right right
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and if you made it effective July 2nd
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that would put the language of 49 back
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
in control so you'd have 49 for a week
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
you'd have 655 for a day and then you'd
 
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:54.740 align:start position:0%
have the language of 49 now in 409
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
control again okay so so we need to make
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
paragraph two match sp49 right which is
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
three million correct right that's why I
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
brought it up okay actually it's the two
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
sub paragraphs
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
um Roman one and Roman two Roman one and
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
two yeah there's a
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
oh because of the 125 percent right
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
and um no the paragraph Roman 1 says
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that the close of the biennium any funds
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
in excess shall be used to reducing
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
we may have to confer with OLS on that
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
and figure out exactly what needs to be
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
changed but but our intent is that that
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
of uh sp49 are you okay with that yeah
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
no no we need to do that yeah
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes I made a note
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
but yes we will we'll change this
 
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:01.220 align:start position:0%
language to agree with Senate Bill 49
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
change the effective date so it was
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
okay yeah Madam chair I think um
 
00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:14.089 align:start position:0%
okay yeah Madam chair I think um
if

00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
maybe have the the effective date the
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
15th of July
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
because then that way you're going to
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
have time for 49 and 605 to go through
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
and this would probably be the last one
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
it takes a couple of weeks to go through
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
enrolled bills and then get everybody to
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
sign off because sometimes people once
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the 30th of June comes along everybody
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
scatters or everyone goes on vacation or
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
they have plans so perhaps a more
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
effective date would be the 15th now
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
would you I'm sure it will take a while
 
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:50.420 align:start position:0%
for everything Shake through anyway
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay okay
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
all right that's
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.890 align:start position:0%
any other
concerns

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
and this has got the
 
00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:09.829 align:start position:0%
and this has got the
um

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
discipline investigation requirements
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.089 align:start position:0%
agreed to
um

00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
Auto references all right
 
00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:26.630 align:start position:0%
Auto references all right
um

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
so does anyone have any any other issues
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh I just put that in Section 8 with the
 
00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:42.140 align:start position:0%
licenses and renewal labs
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah section 310 colon 8 license
 
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.390 align:start position:0%
yeah section 310 colon 8 license
renewals

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
renewals
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're saying the same thing the language
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the Senate is slightly different than
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.859 --> 00:51:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
section 3108 license renewals
 
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.089 align:start position:0%
section 3108 license renewals
and

00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
yes speak to that
 
00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:16.910 align:start position:0%
yes speak to that
initially

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to address and we
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
tried a variety of of different language
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
approaches is that
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
um apprentices can have a different
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
license term and that
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
um as we standardize oplc license terms
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
to two years
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
it's just not reflected in every license
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
just yet and so we originally said
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
two years from the date of issuance
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
because oplc needed a date so they
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
needed the two years or if different the
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
terms stated on the face of the license
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:55.549 align:start position:0%
terms stated on the face of the license
um

00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
and so I think that raised a couple
 
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.890 align:start position:0%
and so I think that raised a couple
concerns

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
both from oblc and I think from the
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
electricians and so what we ended up
 
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
with was something we sort of drafted
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
live in committee which is to say except
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
for those apprentices licensed for one
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
year in accordance with the rules
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
adopted in 541a and that was to capture
 
00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:19.250 align:start position:0%
adopted in 541a and that was to capture
like

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
current state in terms of licenses that
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
were shorter than two years and then
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully future State under the rules
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
adopted if I if I remember yeah okay
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine I just wanted to make sure
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
any other concerns
 
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.450 align:start position:0%
any other concerns
okay

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
all right section 27 is the Social Work
 
00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:43.609 align:start position:0%
all right section 27 is the Social Work
compact

00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
compact
 
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:45.770 align:start position:0%
compact
and

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm we don't have section numbers on our
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
yeah draft here so we're it'll work well
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to find this it's the
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
last uh
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work okay
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
it says a new section Social Work
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
compact adopted
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
there's about 10 pages of it yes
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
randomly section Pages yeah put
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
something in here okay
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
yep reference change positions yeah all
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
of a sudden we do have section numbers
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
but some of them do some don't all right
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's a brand new section yes
 
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.930 align:start position:0%
it's a brand new section yes
um

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
that language in Edna
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
with a retained bill that and we plan to
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
to consider it over the over the fall
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and probably release it to the house in
 
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.809 align:start position:0%
and probably release it to the house in
January

00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not convinced we need to
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
short-circuit that process by Plumbing
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
so the language came to all of us
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
obviously from oplc and as in my
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
conversations with the director she was
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
very uh I don't I don't think Lindsay's
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
not here today right no she doesn't yeah
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
she was
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
very eager to have this in because they
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in the first seven one of
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
the first seven states because that that
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
passes it because that gives us a seat
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
at the tooth table for rule making going
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
forward and Doug Mr oselle please feel
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
free to jump in if I'm not representing
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
this correctly but and um so that's the
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
conversation that I had with her and I
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
took it you know we discussed it in the
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
senate in committee and we had uh strong
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
support for adding this language too so
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was good for us to get
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
in now we understand and respect that
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
the house was looking at holding it and
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
but with this compact language as you
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
know we have to kind of pass it as it is
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
or not pass it at all so there isn't
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
really room to modify or edit we just
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
felt we were ready to pass it so we put
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
it in the spill okay thank you uh
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
Mr osterhaus do you know if how many
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
states have adopted this language
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
because I as I recall this is brand new
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
as of
 
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.349 align:start position:0%
as of
May

00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
it is brand new and I'm just going off
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
memory but it may be one or two
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
maybe two I think but I'd have to
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
my understanding was I'm not certain if
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
any have yet and it may be one or two
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
but that many were considering it in the
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
next in the coming months and that if we
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
got in on the front end now we would be
 
00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:34.940 align:start position:0%
on the early end doing that
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I have been um speaking with
 
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.190 align:start position:0%
thank you I have been um speaking with
um

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:42.020 align:start position:0%
uh director Courtney on this because
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we see these bills and you
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
really wonder what the heck has happened
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
to them after you sign them I mean do we
 
00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:51.980 align:start position:0%
actually become do the compacts actually
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
occur and the information that I
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
received from her which I shared with
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee was that historically
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did this has participated
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
in these compacts has been a has been
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
often a member and we are using them so
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
that during covid I know that the nurses
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
um we used I think it was did we we our
 
00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:20.180 align:start position:0%
nursing staff increased by 25
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
so we do have the ability to use these
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
compacts to our benefit when needed
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
and with the this one is this one came
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
about because of a commission a
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee that Senator Perkins coca and
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
I and representative McMahon and
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
representatives Bishop Pirro were at
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
over the summer to address the hurdles
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
for mental health workers and this was
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
cited as a the social worker hurdle is
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to us or Mount so this
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
and I actually presented a committee I
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
actually tried to it was House Bill 428
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
that this social compact was originally
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
brought to Edna and um I we were going I
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
was going to ask Edna to attach it to a
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but indeed you had attached
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
it to House Bill 409 so I left Let It Go
 
00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could work this out
 
00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:27.950 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could work this out
today

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
so obviously the Senate is in support of
 
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
the language that we added I guess
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
all right I think I'd like to have a
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
brief caucus
 
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.010 align:start position:0%
brief caucus
okay

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.520 --> 01:04:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for waiting
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative it might if we might let
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
Mr hostel just add one thing about your
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
previous question I think he has info
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be interested oh yes thank you uh
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
John dejoy and came up and spoke to me
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
during the break and told me one state
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
had passed it but there are eight states
 
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.970 align:start position:0%
had passed it but there are eight states
considering

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
the compact right now and they are all
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
good to know
 
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.390 align:start position:0%
good to know
um

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
the the house conferees are agreed that
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a serious issue but we don't want
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
to be rushed into it
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
and since we are considering it
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
and we plan to have it out of committee
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
by on a retained Bill rather than a new
 
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.549 align:start position:0%
by on a retained Bill rather than a new
bill

01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that um you can agree to
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
deleting this section and incorporating
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
it in a different bill
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
so that the Senate feels very strongly
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
that this is important that we act
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
immediately on this
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh we we would like to be on the front
 
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
end and in those first seven states to
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
pass it and with the information that Mr
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
osterhall gave us we really feel
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
strongly that this needs to remain and
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
all right and um I think in that case we
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
ought to recess until tomorrow
 
01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.210 align:start position:0%
ought to recess until tomorrow
and

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
see what we can do about reaching an
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
agreement on that you want to take a
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
recess or just take a break
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh well we're good when would a good
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
point when would we be able to get
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
together the late this afternoon so so
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding is a recess means we
 
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:09.059 align:start position:0%
have to then decomply with the 24-hour
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
notice if we want to just take a break
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
and talk later we can do that it I think
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
that would be our preference I don't
 
01:06:15.849 --> 01:06:15.859 align:start position:0%
know what everyone else understands
 
01:06:23.049 --> 01:06:23.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I have one and two as well
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I have two so uh it can't be before
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
o'clock if that's four o'clock is that
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
is four o'clock agreeable
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
today or would you rather wait till
 
01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:38.569 align:start position:0%
today or would you rather wait till
tomorrow

01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
I'm here every single day so yeah I'm
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
here every day
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
I want to be respectful of your time
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what you guys are I
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.089 align:start position:0%
know I'm here Monday Tuesday Wednesday

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%

I will arrange for that and you will be
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
notified what room that will continue in
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes before we because it's very it's
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
simple I just want to make sure that the
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
last uh section the last section was on
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
repeal and if it refers to obsolescent
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
references that you put in had to do
 
01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:25.699 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
administration of the estate commission
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
the board of manufacturing the
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
manufacturing installation board these
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
all these things this is the Detachment
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
I believe of the administration
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
Provisions for oplc
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that this is
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
just a this is cleanup language correct
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
if I may share yes this is language that
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
was inserted by oplc because
 
01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:51.709 align:start position:0%
was inserted by oplc because
um

01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
when we pass 655 as it was and when you
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
guys had taken the different pieces of
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
Prior oplc requested that I insert this
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to make sure that we're
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
not that's fine that's really the only
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
issue that remains is the social workers
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
compound right okay thank you okay we've
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
got some some language tweaks and a new
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
effective thing
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
thank you all we'll see you at three
 
01:09:14.759 --> 02:31:40.309 align:start position:0%
thank you all we'll see you at three
okay

02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
being one o'clock we'll get started
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
however people yeah they can that is
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.889 --> 02:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
all right being one o'clock we'll get
 
02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
all right being one o'clock we'll get
started

02:32:56.090 --> 02:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.530 align:start position:0%
started
um

02:32:57.530 --> 02:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:59.210 --> 02:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
on this committee conference for host
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 461.
 
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.910 align:start position:0%
Bill 461.
and

02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think as on the house position as we
 
02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh look at this we see that
 
02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
there have been issues where positions
 
02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
replaced with from full time to
 
02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
replaced with from full time to
part-time

02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:22.730 align:start position:0%
part-time
and

02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
having seen it occur more than once and
 
02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:27.770 align:start position:0%
having seen it occur more than once and
it's

02:33:27.770 --> 02:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:33:29.809 --> 02:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
has happened
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
um we look at it on the house side as it
 
02:33:35.770 --> 02:33:35.780 align:start position:0%
being unfair to the rest of the
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
employers and changing a position from
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
full-time to part-time and that city or
 
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
town walking away from the unfunded
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
liability for that position when they do
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
and passing it on to all the other
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
groups that have to pick up that cost
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so what we did here if we look at our
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
version is we put in a penalty that if
 
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.250 align:start position:0%
version is we put in a penalty that if
they

02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
are not prohibited from doing that
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
they're just obligated to pay
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
that unfunded liability portion going
 
02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:09.690 align:start position:0%
forward until it's paid off
 
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:10.250 align:start position:0%
forward until it's paid off
[Music]

02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:34:10.260 --> 02:34:14.570 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:34:14.570 --> 02:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
I can say that
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and I can look at over at Marty and
 
02:34:22.250 --> 02:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
say there have been positions that have
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
been changed from full time to part-time
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
and we're a city or town has walked away
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
from that
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and we're just trying to stop this
 
02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
from the continuation of occurring as a
 
02:34:34.849 --> 02:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
matter of fairness to all those other
 
02:34:34.859 --> 02:34:36.530 align:start position:0%
matter of fairness to all those other
communities

02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.190 align:start position:0%
communities
and

02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:41.809 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:34:41.809 --> 02:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
let you explain why you've amended it
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
the way you did it on your side thank
 
02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:47.389 align:start position:0%
the way you did it on your side thank
you

02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we when we heard this bill we
 
02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
certainly recognized that it could
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
happen and it may be happening and
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're I'm sure there are a handful of
 
02:34:58.730 --> 02:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
examples as we got testimony from from
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
Marty and others and especially for the
 
02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities that
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
it may be happening and it probably is
 
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
at a very small level but what we didn't
 
02:35:09.230 --> 02:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
understand was the impact of how it was
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
impacting the retirement system for one
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
and two how it would impact the
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities if we said no you can't
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
do this or you've got to have this
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
penalty so that's why we felt that
 
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know the Senate felt that there was
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
definitely a potentially an issue there
 
02:35:24.650 --> 02:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
and it warranted looking at but we
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
weren't ready to step up to the point of
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
assigning a penalty and saying this is
 
02:35:31.010 --> 02:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
where you're going to you know this is
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
where it's going to go so in uh in
 
02:35:34.969 --> 02:35:34.979 align:start position:0%
working and talking with the municipal
 
02:35:36.889 --> 02:35:36.899 align:start position:0%
Association and others we felt that it
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
was best that we take the position of
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
let's let's take a look at this let's
 
02:35:43.490 --> 02:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
study it and see how much of an impact
 
02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
it really is and then having that
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
information we could go forward if
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessary if we felt legislation was
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:55.319 --> 02:35:56.570 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
well we did hear in committee that uh
 
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
this was happening it has happened in
 
02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
the past
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
and and and as as it was said
 
02:36:10.370 --> 02:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
on our side opposition of it being fair
 
02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:11.929 align:start position:0%
on our side opposition of it being fair
um

02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
for somebody for a town to take a
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
full-time position and Mark it down as
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
to do away with it and say we'll just
 
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
handle that with a part-time visit
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're just playing games
 
02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
and they're playing games in uh in uh
 
02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
penalizing the New Hampshire retirement
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
system because as we all know there's a
 
02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:31.790 align:start position:0%
system because as we all know there's a
huge

02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
deficit that must be made up and it will
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
be made up and
 
02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
not in my lifetime but in somebody's
 
02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
lifetime we'll get rid of that deficit
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
but until then anyone playing games to
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh so they don't have to pay in
 
02:36:50.090 --> 02:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever amount of money they
 
02:36:52.849 --> 02:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
think they're saving uh went against the
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
um no no representative property well uh
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I I would also like to
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
bring up when this does occur chances
 
02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:07.250 align:start position:0%
bring up when this does occur chances
are

02:37:07.250 --> 02:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in the past the person is
 
02:37:13.250 --> 02:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
eligible for some retirement benefits if
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
they hit the age and time limits we
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
require it so therefore this particular
 
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
candidate and working for another
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
Community will be collecting a pension
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
which will be drawn down again you know
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
against the pension system on top of
 
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
that going to the community that's not
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
contributing you know and I don't want
 
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
to say that it occurs but is are they
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
doing it because it is the best
 
02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
doing it because it is the best
candidate

02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
or is there any type of maybe perhaps
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
open the door
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the negative sense I'm not saying
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
that it did occur but in a negative
 
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
sense it could open the door for
 
02:37:54.889 --> 02:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
somebody who was popular or something
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
like that to just uh cement the system
 
02:38:01.370 --> 02:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
that we have so the best way to defend
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
the system is to protect it as it is
 
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
right now and follow like the house
 
02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:10.010 align:start position:0%
right now and follow like the house
recommendation

02:38:10.010 --> 02:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
chairman there were um some real issues
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
with this legislation and a lot of
 
02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
with this legislation and a lot of
tension

02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
tension
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
um it seeks to really put a blanket
 
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
solution to
 
02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:26.809 align:start position:0%
solution to
um

02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
a variety of different entities that are
 
02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
very different and that in my opinion is
 
02:38:34.969 --> 02:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
trouble you've got the tension with
 
02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
local control is the state now going to
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
be telling the municipalities about the
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
hiring and and and how to fill positions
 
02:38:46.030 --> 02:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
do we do we want to go down that road
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
secondly you've got the issue of towns
 
02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
versus counties because the counties as
 
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
well are political subdivisions and is
 
02:38:58.250 --> 02:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
how is this going to affect the counties
 
02:38:59.690 --> 02:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
um you also have the difference between
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
a very large municipality like Nashua or
 
02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:04.550 align:start position:0%
a very large municipality like Nashua or
Manchester

02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
um laconian I would even argue
 
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
Londonderry because we had testimony
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
concerning Londonderry versus a small
 
02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:12.170 align:start position:0%
concerning Londonderry versus a small
community

02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
so we wanted we figured we would go to a
 
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
study committee to try to resolve those
 
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
larger issues we also had testimony from
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin from the retirement system
 
02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.130 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin from the retirement system
that

02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
um he claims that though a position is
 
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
downgraded it's not always due to
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
avoiding pension debt costs it's that
 
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
through municipality analysis these jobs
 
02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
really do become a part-time job so if a
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
municipality decides they want to
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
change from a full-time to a part-time
 
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
how involved is the state going to be in
 
02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:48.899 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that question needs
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be resolved as well and then Mr
 
02:39:53.929 --> 02:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
Carlin also brought up a couple of other
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
points that I'd like to mention here
 
02:39:58.849 --> 02:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
um that really deal with the
 
02:40:01.130 --> 02:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the bill that the bill has to specify
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire retirement system
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
what to adopt in order to enforce
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
against uh these avoiding the potential
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
the pension debt
 
02:40:15.650 --> 02:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
how are they going to do that they need
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
us to tell them how to do that secondly
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be language added
 
02:40:23.809 --> 02:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
regarding the mechanical process of the
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislation in providing the employers
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire retirement system
 
02:40:32.090 --> 02:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
is overseeing and how they are to notify
 
02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Retirement System
 
02:40:38.450 --> 02:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
so because of that testimony that's why
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
we really said okay we've got to be
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
really careful what we do here and we've
 
02:40:45.650 --> 02:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
got to resolve these issues before this
 
02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
can go forward and we felt that a study
 
02:40:49.370 --> 02:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
committee was going to be the best way
 
02:40:57.889 --> 02:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson oh sorry
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I think
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson really encapsulated what
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
we heard and the way the reason we voted
 
02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
I just look at
 
02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:22.429 align:start position:0%
for all of us
time

02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
is valuable to all of us and we know the
 
02:41:26.690 --> 02:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
number of study committees that this
 
02:41:28.969 --> 02:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
legislature has put forward in the past
 
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to reduce that going
 
02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:31.809 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to reduce that going
forward

02:41:31.809 --> 02:41:31.819 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
because we all serve on a number of them
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
and get stretched pretty thin as we go
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
into October when these reports need to
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
I think our feeling is that
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
well it sounds good isn't all that
 
02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
necessary because I think the retirement
 
02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
necessary because I think the retirement
system

02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.630 align:start position:0%
system
has

02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
the information that we're already
 
02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
looking for as to the positions that
 
02:42:01.610 --> 02:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:42:04.969 --> 02:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
changed from full-time to part-time
 
02:42:04.979 --> 02:42:07.550 align:start position:0%
changed from full-time to part-time
and

02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
how much that the unfunded liability
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
loses per year when those
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
positions are changed from full-time to
 
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.969 align:start position:0%
positions are changed from full-time to
part-time

02:42:22.969 --> 02:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
02:42:22.979 --> 02:42:23.630 align:start position:0%
part-time
um

02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:26.819 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure a study committee will
 
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
get us any further along than what we
 
02:42:31.730 --> 02:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
can get right now from
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
Marty in the system to give us those
 
02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:35.690 align:start position:0%
Marty in the system to give us those
numbers

02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
um I I hear your concerns about and this
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
is the first I think we hear of it
 
02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
of some of the concerns on the way this
 
02:42:43.969 --> 02:42:43.979 align:start position:0%
legislation was drafted that wasn't
 
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention when we heard
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that there were issues and how
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
they would recoup or do what they needed
 
02:42:51.410 --> 02:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:42:55.250 --> 02:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
um so on that end I mean it's when we
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
put this together we didn't hear any of
 
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
those brought forward
 
02:43:03.410 --> 02:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
with that being said I will leave it at
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
putting a stop to this going forward
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
from here going forward so that
 
02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability isn't passed on
 
02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
to others in cities and towns with these
 
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
changes in position
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
and going to a study committee I think
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
we can just Reach Out
 
02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
as a group and ask for what we want for
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
information without having to have
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
meetings and
 
02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
of those Natures to get that
 
02:43:39.410 --> 02:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl thank you respectfully Mr
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
chair we we asked a lot of questions
 
02:43:44.929 --> 02:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
that of Mr Carlin and and missac as they
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
came through as to how these are going
 
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
to impact the communities and the
 
02:43:50.330 --> 02:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
information we were looking for they
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have answers to at that time and
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you were looking
 
02:43:56.809 --> 02:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
for we didn't get answers to and that's
 
02:43:58.429 --> 02:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
why we decided that
 
02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
we couldn't in good conscience go
 
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
forward and put forth something that
 
02:44:04.610 --> 02:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
could definitely be a detriment to the
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
many of the municipalities in the sense
 
02:44:08.110 --> 02:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
of putting this fine on for them and and
 
02:44:10.910 --> 02:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
taking them out of the ability to manage
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
their employees the way they needed to
 
02:44:14.450 --> 02:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
we had concerns about school systems as
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
well whether this would impact them we
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
weren't sure on that there were just too
 
02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
many things that we didn't have a real
 
02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
good clear definition on them always
 
02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
trying to be respectful of the taxpayers
 
02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
money as well as end all of our time as
 
02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
well there were many study committees
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't think need to happen but to
 
02:44:31.309 --> 02:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
me I felt that this was and I'm the one
 
02:44:32.570 --> 02:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
that introduced the language to move it
 
02:44:34.969 --> 02:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
to a study committee and I felt that
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
this certainly you know this condition
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
if it's occurring at any great amount or
 
02:44:42.410 --> 02:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
great frequency then it could be
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the system but we just
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know the impact that it was
 
02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
having or could have and that was what
 
02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
we were concerned about and I think
 
02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
before the Senate felt before we were
 
02:44:53.690 --> 02:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
ready to step forward and penalize towns
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
for making some choices that were good
 
02:44:57.889 --> 02:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
for their own Community as far as how
 
02:44:59.690 --> 02:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
they're managing their time and
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
resources that we wanted to have some
 
02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
more information so I I think the Senate
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
at this point is is not willing to move
 
02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
off from a study committee and because
 
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
we feel that this going to this extent
 
02:45:11.809 --> 02:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
right now without the information we
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
needed wouldn't be what we would feel
 
02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.889 --> 02:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think uh just
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
keep it real short here I I think that
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not prepared to a c to another
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
study committee we've got too many uh we
 
02:45:33.230 --> 02:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
if we want to dig into this we can but
 
02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh the the solution that I'd be looking
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
for is something other than an
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and my question thank you
 
02:45:46.849 --> 02:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
Mr chair to the Senate uh
 
02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
this in essence and I think what I
 
02:45:51.170 --> 02:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
haven't heard in listening to you know
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
my Senate colleagues you're not really
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
against the main
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
Nexus of this particular bill but
 
02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
there's other type of questions and that
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes happens I'm sure with many
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
bills in our careers up here myself 16
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
years I've seen this and I've seen the
 
02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
government of you know a study committee
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
and things flounder and Float out to sea
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
but if we approve this and I think
 
02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
you'll find our committee willing to
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
work with Mr Colin and with members of
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate if we have something the
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
first building block the foundation
 
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
stone is the key okay and I'm saying if
 
02:46:32.809 --> 02:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
we look at this particular bill as a
 
02:46:36.290 --> 02:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
foundation stone maybe as we work in the
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
second half of the biennium
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
many of the questions
 
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
can come forward so if we allow this to
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
go through
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh I don't know I'll let
 
02:46:50.090 --> 02:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
my chair make that decision it's his
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
call but I'm sure there'll be people
 
02:46:56.270 --> 02:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:59.210 --> 02:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that representative
 
02:46:59.220 --> 02:46:59.870 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that representative
um

02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think that the impact
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities we really we
 
02:47:07.370 --> 02:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
really don't have a good handle on it in
 
02:47:10.010 --> 02:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
fact we had testimony that the language
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
was vague
 
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to do something we
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
need to be as clear as we possibly can I
 
02:47:20.270 --> 02:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to put something into law and
 
02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
then have to go back and fix it over and
 
02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
over and over again I would rather be
 
02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
proactive and try to get it as right as
 
02:47:33.050 --> 02:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
we possibly can that's why we supported
 
02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
um we in the Senate we take these study
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
committees very seriously I can only
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
speak for myself
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and quite frankly I volunteered to
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
serve on this study committee that's
 
02:47:49.849 --> 02:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
kind of like an Unwritten thing in the
 
02:47:52.490 --> 02:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
Senate if you're proposing one guess who
 
02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
gets to serve on it
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that we can through a
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
study committee strike a balance that
 
02:48:02.809 --> 02:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody can live with
 
02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
because I agree because every time you
 
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
take a position and you go from full
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
time to part-time there is a loss to the
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system and we've we need to
 
02:48:16.450 --> 02:48:16.460 align:start position:0%
figure that out but that is not a
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
one-size-fit-all answer and that's why
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're arguing for the study committee
 
02:48:23.570 --> 02:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
and I can't believe we're arguing for a
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um it's crazy I mean usually that
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but we do agree that this
 
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
is a very important issue and it was
 
02:48:36.530 --> 02:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
something that we took very seriously
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so we took a look at all the
 
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had we had a great
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
discussion in Senate Edna about this and
 
02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
we've said look let's let's take a
 
02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
serious look at this is this a problem
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
because we've heard about this
 
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
so here's an opportunity for us to
 
02:48:57.530 --> 02:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
really dig in get to the bottom of this
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening get the language the
 
02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
retirement system needs and see if we
 
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
can get a balance between the retirement
 
02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
system and the municipalities where
 
02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
system and the municipalities where
everybody

02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
everybody can can live with what we do
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
rather than put something in legislation
 
02:49:14.929 --> 02:49:14.939 align:start position:0%
and then have to keep going back to fix
 
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.020 --> 02:52:31.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:52:31.730 --> 02:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
all right we did we discussed it and we
 
02:52:38.750 --> 02:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
just can't agree to a study committee um
 
02:52:40.130 --> 02:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
if we have to
 
02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:40.969 align:start position:0%
if we have to
um we're

02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
um we're
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
pretty strong on this language I know
 
02:52:44.809 --> 02:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
there may be some issues with what's
 
02:52:45.889 --> 02:52:45.899 align:start position:0%
here from what you heard from the
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
retirement system
so

02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
so
if

02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:52:53.809 --> 02:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
you don't want to come along to this
 
02:52:56.570 --> 02:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
agenda then I'm going to end up reaching
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
out to the sponsor of this legislation
 
02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
to have him work with the retirement
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
system and come back with hopefully
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
something that will work for all of us
 
02:53:07.010 --> 02:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think that Mr chair that's probably
 
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
the best Avenue for this issue because
 
02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
we certainly respect there could be a
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
potential issue here we just weren't
 
02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
ready to take the full step that the
 
02:53:17.690 --> 02:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
house took and felt that looking at the
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
issue was warranted but I I think you
 
02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
know we we discussed in caucus there
 
02:53:25.309 --> 02:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
there may be some opportunities to do
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
some of this at some point but we're not
 
02:53:29.090 --> 02:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
really clear on what we do would want to
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
do without excuse me some further
 
02:53:33.230 --> 02:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
information so I think at this time we
 
02:53:35.330 --> 02:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
are probably at an impasse and
 
02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
we'll have to uh
 
02:53:39.050 --> 02:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
try it again another year if you're
 
02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
going to speak to the sponsor make sure
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor has a conversation with
 
02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association as well as the
 
02:53:49.130 --> 02:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
association of counties I think that's
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
extremely important to get their input
 
02:53:54.530 --> 02:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
into this and to work with them to
 
02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
strike a balance
 
02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
and make sure they understand the impact
 
02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
that it may have potentially on school
 
02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
systems as well because that was one big
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
question that we didn't have so I think
 
02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
these would all be good things to look
 
02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
at going forward
 
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right thank you
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
everyone for coming representative Brian
 
02:54:12.769 --> 02:54:12.779 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Senator cossing made a great
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
offer and yeah thank you do you want the
 
02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this to contact you to
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
keep you abreast in your Committee of
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and uh that that might
 
02:54:26.210 --> 02:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
you know help Grease the wheel on this
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
one you know yeah because it sounds like
 
02:54:32.570 --> 02:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
this Common Ground here I I agree with
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
um I really think there is some common
 
02:54:37.130 --> 02:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
ground we just need to lay it out that's
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
all and we didn't have time to do it we
 
02:54:42.050 --> 02:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
got a lot of testimony that I think is
 
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
conflicting or maybe a little more
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
in-depth than what the house received
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why it caused us to take a
 
02:54:50.450 --> 02:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
step back and to start really
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
questioning what's going on here how do
 
02:54:56.090 --> 02:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
we deal with this how do we allow the
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system most of all to to put
 
02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
legislation in place so they can deal

you have our side by side yes okay good
 
03:33:15.530 --> 03:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.969 --> 03:33:21.979 align:start position:0%
so we're good through page
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
17. we're going to delete the section on
 
03:33:26.279 --> 03:33:28.269 align:start position:0%
17. we're going to delete the section on
page

03:33:28.269 --> 03:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:33:30.650 --> 03:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
18. yep
 
03:33:30.660 --> 03:33:32.269 align:start position:0%
18. yep
and

03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:32.279 --> 03:33:33.650 align:start position:0%
and
uh

03:33:33.650 --> 03:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
this starting on page 19
 
03:33:39.729 --> 03:33:39.739 align:start position:0%
is something that's totally new to us
 
03:33:42.650 --> 03:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
and we which was
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
laid on the table in the Senate it's so
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
our position is that if you can explain
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
to us why we need to do it in this bill
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
will listen to you but we're not
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise inclined to accept it without
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
good reason so
 
03:34:02.030 --> 03:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have Senator Whitley
 
03:34:04.130 --> 03:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
because it was her legislation thank you
 
03:34:05.450 --> 03:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:34:08.929 --> 03:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
um so this bill actually at the house
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
has seen before this is this issue has
 
03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
been really worked on almost for over a
 
03:34:14.700 --> 03:34:16.190 align:start position:0%
been really worked on almost for over a
decade

03:34:16.190 --> 03:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
decade
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and it and it really is just laying
 
03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
basement level protections for nursing
 
03:34:23.929 --> 03:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
mothers in the workplace this language
 
03:34:26.809 --> 03:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
was included in my bill Senate Bill 175
 
03:34:29.809 --> 03:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as momnibus and it
 
03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
was laid on the table uh as the Senate
 
03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
was laid on the table uh as the Senate
does

03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
a typical practice in a budget year
 
03:34:38.090 --> 03:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
there was a decision made not to put it
 
03:34:39.530 --> 03:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
in the budget because it was strictly
 
03:34:39.540 --> 03:34:41.210 align:start position:0%
in the budget because it was strictly
policy

03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:34:44.090 --> 03:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and instead to attach it to this bill
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
so again this was non-controversial it
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
has passed the Senate multiple times
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
um I will say that the only thing that
 
03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
is different now than last year is that
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
the federal government has now passed
 
03:34:57.710 --> 03:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
the pump act which provides Federal
 
03:34:59.870 --> 03:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
protections this is a little different
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
because it's actually a New Hampshire
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
based complaint process so I wouldn't
 
03:35:06.410 --> 03:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
say that there's you know new rights
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
that are being added but what we are
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
doing is making sure that New Hampshire
 
03:35:12.530 --> 03:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
moms have a New Hampshire complaint
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
process that they don't have to go to
 
03:35:17.570 --> 03:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
the EEOC that this is based in in New
 
03:35:19.849 --> 03:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law I will say the other
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
issues that we are
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
um the folks that are working on this
 
03:35:25.729 --> 03:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
were very responsive to the business
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
community and wanted to make sure that
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
it was you know it worked for our small
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
businesses so you'll see that the
 
03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
definition for employer some states
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
include all employers but this includes
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
those employers that have six or more
 
03:35:44.570 --> 03:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
employees we added of course a
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
definition for undue hardship
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
that is very important to our business
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
Community we also added a definition
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
about what a reasonable break period
 
03:35:55.729 --> 03:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
actually was this was very important to
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
our moms
 
03:35:58.610 --> 03:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
um a lot of folks who have never nursed
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
before don't understand that you do need
 
03:36:00.479 --> 03:36:01.790 align:start position:0%
before don't understand that you do need
to

03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
um pump every three hours that's a sort
 
03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
of biological need of course or women
 
03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
would be in a lot of pain and it's
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
important to maintain their supply for
 
03:36:14.090 --> 03:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
their baby so that's why we defined a
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable break period it was also a
 
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
request that we were very specific about
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
that so we wanted to be responsive to
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
that as much as possible so
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
um again and then lastly there's a
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
hardship exemption so recognizing that
 
03:36:31.370 --> 03:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
this is something that businesses need
 
03:36:33.170 --> 03:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
to get used to we added that and then
 
03:36:35.929 --> 03:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
lastly we pushed out the implementation
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
dates again while while our businesses
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
were getting adjusted to the federal
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
requirements and these new requirements
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the effective dates are
 
03:36:49.250 --> 03:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.550 --> 03:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:36:53.870 --> 03:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you madam
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for that explanation
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
I actually was unaware of the pump act I
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could provide some
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
information about what the federal
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
protections will be
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have those in front of me but
 
03:37:05.570 --> 03:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
there is someone here who can provide
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
information about the federal pump act
 
03:37:08.210 --> 03:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
if the committee is interested in
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
might have as a follow-up
 
03:37:15.889 --> 03:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's it's one of the
 
03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
areas where if there is already a
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
protection I would want to make sure
 
03:37:20.450 --> 03:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
that they're not in Conflict
 
03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
um actually I can answer that I do know
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
I don't have the pump act but we did do
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
an analysis and that these are entirely
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with those Federal
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
requirements but more tailored to New
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and then the all
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're not giving additional rights that
 
03:37:36.410 --> 03:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
are already in federal law what we're
 
03:37:38.750 --> 03:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
doing is giving a new so if a complaint
 
03:37:40.490 --> 03:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
happens it will go through New Hampshire
 
03:37:42.889 --> 03:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
agencies rather than federal agencies
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned a compact
 
03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned a compact
compact

03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
oh pump act excuse me
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation is called the
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
it does yes okay fine that makes it
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
makes a lot more sense thank you yes
 
03:38:06.050 --> 03:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
and when is that effective
 
03:38:07.849 --> 03:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's already effective now I'm being
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
told my expert is sailing right there
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh I will just note that Lisa soroy
 
03:38:16.370 --> 03:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
is here she is uh she works with the
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and public health but she also um is on
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
the breastfeeding task force that has
 
03:38:24.190 --> 03:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
worked on this legislation for decades
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
she's a plan
 
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um my other
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
question is this only provides
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
protection for women up until one year
 
03:38:33.769 --> 03:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
after birth of the child however the
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines from The Who and the CDC
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
recommend longer breastfeeding I'm
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that passing this would shut
 
03:38:41.809 --> 03:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
off the opportunity for breast for
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and expressing mothers to
 
03:38:45.530 --> 03:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
have access in their workplace were we
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
to pass this
 
03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh I see it as the opposite so right now
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
women don't have protections and and
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
with this they would have protections
 
03:38:56.450 --> 03:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you know of course the the literature
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
supports the biological and sort of
 
03:39:01.969 --> 03:39:01.979 align:start position:0%
health benefits are if women you know
 
03:39:03.530 --> 03:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
nurse for a year
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
um we thought though that aligned with
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
these protections so absolutely we're
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
adding protections we're not taking
 
03:39:07.979 --> 03:39:11.269 align:start position:0%
adding protections we're not taking
anyway

03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:13.729 --> 03:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
I have a question about it sure you say
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
that you have that you notify employer
 
03:39:18.530 --> 03:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
two weeks prior to me needing break
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.650 --> 03:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
all right um how is does that relate to
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
a temporary disability for be for having
 
03:39:32.809 --> 03:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
actually having the baby
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
I presume that that when you come back
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
you you would be needing to to do this
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and not everyone not everyone pumps
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
that work I think this is for those
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
women who choose to pump at work
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and the request is similar to how an
 
03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
employee would request a reasonable
 
03:39:53.809 --> 03:39:53.819 align:start position:0%
accommodation so it's very similar to
 
03:39:59.690 --> 03:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
to their land
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair as a mom three
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
times I definitely appreciate the
 
03:40:08.090 --> 03:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
challenges and the challenges when new
 
03:40:09.650 --> 03:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
and emerging things happen with your
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
child one of my big concerns would be
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
that by placing this into our statutes a
 
03:40:16.010 --> 03:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
lot of times when there's a floor of
 
03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
requirements a lot of employers and
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
different ones come down to the floor as
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to what they've already offered
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
for their employees I have a I have a
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
large concern around the two-week notice
 
03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
because if somebody had been working
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
with formula and instead they needed to
 
03:40:32.690 --> 03:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
pump up they needed to increase because
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
their formula was no longer available
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
like we experienced this year and
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
instead they needed to increase their
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
pumping so that their child was fully on
 
03:40:41.809 --> 03:40:41.819 align:start position:0%
pumped milk that that two-year
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that two-week requirement
 
03:40:46.610 --> 03:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
might actually be more of a hurdle I
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the work you're trying to
 
03:40:50.330 --> 03:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
do in order to codify this but I I do
 
03:40:51.530 --> 03:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
know that there have been a lot of good
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
accommodations that have happened
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
through many many workplaces through the
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
pressure to support mothers and I think
 
03:41:00.670 --> 03:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we've done a very good job so far
 
03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
through this private negotiation between
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
employees and employers and I'm afraid
 
03:41:07.130 --> 03:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
that this two weeks is going to hurt
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
moms who are going through a feeding
 
03:41:08.580 --> 03:41:09.710 align:start position:0%
moms who are going through a feeding
crisis

03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that concern I think
 
03:41:13.370 --> 03:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know we did put in here language
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
that nothing in this would prohibit
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
employees and employers from negotiating
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
what works best for them
 
03:41:22.849 --> 03:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
um I think we there are some businesses
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
that do this great but I know Lisa can
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
specifically you know has received
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
complaints from moms where some business
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
artists aren't doing so this is a
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
basement level floor of protections for
 
03:41:36.290 --> 03:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
moms super important because we know
 
03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
that a lot of moms leave the workforce
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
right in the first year we just know
 
03:41:42.769 --> 03:41:42.779 align:start position:0%
that in particular during the pandemic
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
we lost 10 percent of our Workforce
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
between ages 25 and 34. these are our
 
03:41:49.969 --> 03:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
new moms they just left the workforce
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately they're not coming
 
03:41:53.690 --> 03:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
back this is not a Panacea to solve that
 
03:41:56.330 --> 03:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
problem but it's a piece of the puzzle a
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
lot of moms leave leave the workforce
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
because they just cannot manage both
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
things I know that it was a challenge
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
for me and I I had a a very supportive
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh workplace I was able to pump at work
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:13.439 --> 03:42:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair on page 20 the
 
03:42:22.370 --> 03:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
last paragraph number three
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
it says that a nursing employee shall
 
03:42:26.450 --> 03:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
notify its employer at least two weeks
 
03:42:27.889 --> 03:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
prior to needing reasonable break
 
03:42:29.690 --> 03:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
periods and sufficient space for
 
03:42:32.929 --> 03:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
expression of milk I would I think that
 
03:42:35.090 --> 03:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
it should say to protect the employer
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
how that notice is to be given
 
03:42:41.929 --> 03:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
um being a Massachusetts employer we've
 
03:42:44.570 --> 03:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
hit this several several times where if
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's not specific enough an employee may
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
say oh I notified you and it was out of
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
text or it was an email or it didn't go
 
03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
to the right email or the email was
 
03:42:56.450 --> 03:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
rejected so I think it needs to be per
 
03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:59.769 align:start position:0%
rejected so I think it needs to be per
employer's

03:42:59.769 --> 03:42:59.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
policies thank you
 
03:43:04.010 --> 03:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great suggestion we could
 
03:43:06.290 --> 03:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
either say shell notify in writing or
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
she'll notify in line
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
as with the employer's policies I would
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to include any of those
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
I think in line with the employer's
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
policies would be the appropriate thing
 
03:43:24.050 --> 03:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
employers policies thank you for that
 
03:43:25.979 --> 03:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
employers policies thank you for that
suggestion

03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:39.769 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm concerned about this um not
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
so much the break period but the
 
03:43:49.849 --> 03:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
sufficient space bit depending on
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
what the facilities are
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
that may be incredibly difficult to to
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish I mean I I worked in the
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
storefront um
 
03:44:02.330 --> 03:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
the drugstore
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't any place where you
 
03:44:07.190 --> 03:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
could have privacy outside of the site
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
of people
 
03:44:10.690 --> 03:44:10.700 align:start position:0%
except the bathroom which you've
 
03:44:13.190 --> 03:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
explicitly eliminated
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.610 --> 03:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
is something that is
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
a major problem for some very small
 
03:44:27.290 --> 03:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
employers and I would think that you
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
increase the number of employees that
 
03:44:35.330 --> 03:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
this of the size of the businesses this
 
03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
would applied to thank you for that
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of conversation about
 
03:44:41.690 --> 03:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
about just that issue I will note that
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
this they're already required in federal
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
law to do this again the sufficient
 
03:44:49.130 --> 03:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
space we chose this sixth number because
 
03:44:49.140 --> 03:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
space we chose this sixth number because
um

03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:52.190 --> 03:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh our New Hampshire non-discrimination
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
statute applies to businesses with six
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
or more employees so the Department of
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
Labor actually provided us some legal
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
advice that this was the best
 
03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
um definition of employer that aligned
 
03:45:04.849 --> 03:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
with current law so that's why we chose
 
03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
that number
 
03:45:08.210 --> 03:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
and the sufficient space you know again
 
03:45:10.190 --> 03:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're not requiring them or federal law
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't require them nor does this law
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
require the building of a new pod or the
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
creation it's just um uh you know just
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
this area and there's definition of what
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
that area should be and of course that
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's important that it's not a bathroom
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
although I know many many moms have
 
03:45:28.610 --> 03:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
probably pumped or nursed in a bathroom
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
um but again that we wanted to make this
 
03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
as consistent with existing federal laws
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
possible and likewise with who it should
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
apply to that was consistent with New
 
03:45:43.809 --> 03:45:43.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.490 --> 03:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so one of the concerns that I
 
03:45:49.190 --> 03:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
have when we write our own law because
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
we want to include the federal law is if
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
the changes if there are changes to the
 
03:45:56.210 --> 03:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
federal law I mean
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
does the federal law apply to people to
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire now
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would love to defer to Lisa if she can
 
03:46:05.330 --> 03:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
talk about the federal law it's just not
 
03:46:07.849 --> 03:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise if the committee
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
would oblige I'm asking that question
 
03:46:12.290 --> 03:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
follow up because if we write a separate
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
law and then something changes in the
 
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
federal law do we are we therefore then
 
03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
creating a situation where we have to
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
change you know what I mean I see what
 
03:46:21.530 --> 03:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
you're saying so this doesn't necess
 
03:46:23.150 --> 03:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
this is still going to be New Hampshire
 
03:46:25.370 --> 03:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
statute so say the federal law goes away
 
03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
this will stand on its own
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
more more importantly what happens if
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
there's a major change to the federal
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
law this will stand on its own so this
 
03:46:36.170 --> 03:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't refer to federal law this stands
 
03:46:38.090 --> 03:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
on its own so we would have to we you
 
03:46:39.650 --> 03:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
know they would have to they could
 
03:46:41.090 --> 03:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
repeal the pump act and this would
 
03:46:41.100 --> 03:46:42.830 align:start position:0%
repeal the pump act and this would
remain

03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
remain
 
03:46:45.410 --> 03:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
because okay follow up thank you so I'm
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
looking at this sufficient space thing
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I know from from my from my own
 
03:46:49.680 --> 03:46:50.809 align:start position:0%
and I know from from my from my own
committee

03:46:50.809 --> 03:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:53.450 --> 03:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
language like the location of the space
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
provides shall be within a reasonable
 
03:46:57.170 --> 03:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
walk of the employee's work site well
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what is a reasonable
 
03:46:58.920 --> 03:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what is a reasonable
walk

03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
walk
 
03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's those kinds of yes no and I
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate all these questions and I
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
will say that you know there you know
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
these were all um extensive
 
03:47:10.910 --> 03:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had with the
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
business community and with the
 
03:47:12.840 --> 03:47:14.450 align:start position:0%
business community and with the
stakeholders

03:47:14.450 --> 03:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
03:47:17.330 --> 03:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
um uh and we didn't want to say it has
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
to be within a mile we didn't say it had
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
to be in a half a mile so um a
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable walk needs to stand stand on
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
its own unless we want to define the the
 
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
mile or you know but I don't think we
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
want to do that either I think again
 
03:47:33.170 --> 03:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation between employee
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and an employer and we want to maintain
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.170 --> 03:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you my
 
03:47:43.490 --> 03:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
question had actually been similar to
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I I can't imagine being able to
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
walk a mile one way pump and then walk a
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
mile the other way certainly that only
 
03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
30 minutes yeah that wouldn't be
 
03:47:52.849 --> 03:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
reasonable my other question would be do
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
you consider it reasonable for those who
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
are in the state house to walk all the
 
03:47:58.370 --> 03:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
way to the lob basement for the nursing
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
pod or would you do you think that it's
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
more reasonable that you don't have to
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
walk from building to building again we
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be that prescriptive and
 
03:48:09.650 --> 03:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
so you know if the employee doesn't
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
think it's reasonable they have an
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on that but again we
 
03:48:15.050 --> 03:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to maintain that flexibility and
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
not Define that what is determined to be
 
03:48:18.889 --> 03:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
reasonable and this is you know a
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
similar legal standard that's in most of
 
03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
our laws
 
03:48:24.650 --> 03:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
then as a follow-up if an employee says
 
03:48:26.570 --> 03:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
that it's not reasonable to walk during
 
03:48:29.330 --> 03:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
session from the state house over to the
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
nursing pod in the basement of the lob
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
who would they take that up with if they
 
03:48:34.729 --> 03:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
believe that that's taking in their way
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
away from their duties either here or at
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
another facility so this statute is
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Labor so the
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
federal law the complaint is to the you
 
03:48:46.370 --> 03:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
know Federal EOC so complaints pursuant
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the statute would be with our New
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor and
 
03:48:51.530 --> 03:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're and they advise heavily on the
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.239 --> 03:49:04.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:07.210 --> 03:49:07.220 align:start position:0%
since you've carefully made this section
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
I don't see why we need to include it in
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:20.690 --> 03:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
because women have waited for decades
 
03:49:22.610 --> 03:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
for these protections we really have
 
03:49:26.210 --> 03:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
worked for decades on this language
 
03:49:28.729 --> 03:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
um and I just you know the this issue
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
got a lot of press for a long time and I
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
think it's time that New Hampshire you
 
03:49:34.250 --> 03:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
know enacts these state level
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
protections to get our women back to
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
work okay
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
um one my concern is that you know fine
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
you want to make a statement but you're
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
not actually going to do anything for
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
another year so there's no reason we
 
03:49:50.450 --> 03:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
can't this could come in legislation
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
next year so you say there's been
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
conversations but they've been in the
 
03:49:54.720 --> 03:49:56.269 align:start position:0%
conversations but they've been in the
Senate

03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
the house has not been involved uh this
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
exact version of the bill was heard by
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
the house last year and it was also
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussed a different in conference
 
03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
right yeah absolutely absolutely
 
03:50:11.929 --> 03:50:11.939 align:start position:0%
um the the the time the effective date
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
was to get businesses to get to have for
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
them to have time so representative
 
03:50:19.610 --> 03:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's what we've wanted to do
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
I have a logistics question I guess
 
03:50:23.690 --> 03:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you
 
03:50:23.700 --> 03:50:24.590 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you
um

03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
if we have federal law already in place
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
to to govern this for mothers what is
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this at a state level
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
please thank you yeah thank you for that
 
03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
question so it's twofold one instead of
 
03:50:41.210 --> 03:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
having to complain to the federal
 
03:50:43.610 --> 03:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
government administrative agency this
 
03:50:47.150 --> 03:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
allows moms and employers employees to
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
go through a state level process to the
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and that's really
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
important for folks to have a local
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
complaint process
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
um the second is that it was important
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
to all stakeholders to have a new
 
03:51:03.050 --> 03:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based solution to have New
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that worked for us and so
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's why this language was so narrowly
 
03:51:13.969 --> 03:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.150 --> 03:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the follow-up
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
um Senator my my question ranges around
 
03:51:23.150 --> 03:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
the confusion that's created for an
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
employer with the Department of Labor in
 
03:51:28.370 --> 03:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example we have
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor Federal level we
 
03:51:32.929 --> 03:51:32.939 align:start position:0%
have Department of Labor state level and
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
it creates more confusion for every new
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
thing added that oh this complies over
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
here this doesn't comply over here we
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
can get in trouble from this agency can
 
03:51:47.330 --> 03:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
get in trouble from this agency too so
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
um it just I think it adds another layer
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
of confusion for employers as well when
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
the employees already protected
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
right and I and I think the the issue is
 
03:51:58.560 --> 03:51:59.929 align:start position:0%
right and I and I think the the issue is
that

03:51:59.929 --> 03:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:02.650 --> 03:52:02.660 align:start position:0%
um you know we have there's Federal
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and then there's also
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
State non-discrimination and and that
 
03:52:08.510 --> 03:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
goes to the Human Rights Commission in
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so you know it's just
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
a reality in in a democracy you know
 
03:52:15.170 --> 03:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
like like the United States we're going
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
to have state and federal law that folks
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
have to deal with and I think we have to
 
03:52:20.690 --> 03:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
balance here the rights of moms the
 
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
rights of babies with the rights of
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
employers and I think this strikes that
 
03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:26.929 align:start position:0%
employers and I think this strikes that
balance

03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
03:52:30.590 --> 03:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
um was there a fiscal note for what it
 
03:52:32.929 --> 03:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
would cost for our department of labor
 
03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
to address your expected violations of
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
the statute no there wasn't
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up do you think that there
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
would be a significant involvement here
 
03:52:44.210 --> 03:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
at the state level Department of Labor
 
03:52:45.889 --> 03:52:45.899 align:start position:0%
or do you think most of that would go to
 
03:52:47.210 --> 03:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
complaints through this statute will go
 
03:52:50.450 --> 03:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Labor and they were
 
03:52:52.130 --> 03:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with drafting the
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
statute and didn't raise concerns about
 
03:52:58.370 --> 03:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.410 --> 03:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
sorry it's my last follow-up do you
 
03:53:01.610 --> 03:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
think that the reason there was no
 
03:53:03.410 --> 03:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is because this would go
 
03:53:05.330 --> 03:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
into effect in the next budget as
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
opposed to going into effect now uh no
 
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a fiscal note when this
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
identical language was introduced in
 
03:53:13.370 --> 03:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
previous sessions and also when it was
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
introduced before this effective date
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm just trying to grasp
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
around the need for this and then not
 
03:53:29.090 --> 03:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
having a fiscal use fiscal note because
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's not an expectation that it would
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
be used much at the state level in order
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
to oh no I think there's no fiscal note
 
03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Labor already
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.090 --> 03:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
should we caucus for a moment
 
03:53:47.690 --> 03:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
okay we'll caucus for a few minutes
 
03:53:47.700 --> 04:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
okay we'll caucus for a few minutes
foreign

04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for waiting thank you
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
um we were just consolidating our
 
04:01:52.729 --> 04:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
concerns and we would like to say that
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
this should not be a part of this bill
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
this year because
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
thoroughly worked out for employers that
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
are not inclined to be protective of
 
04:02:10.250 --> 04:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
their employees they're going to
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
complain about what's reasonable
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable what's sufficient
 
04:02:18.769 --> 04:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
and things like that and we think that
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you're going to address that you need
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
a little more specificity in some areas
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
we're also concerned that it has not
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
been approved by the house
 
04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
and we would like to work on it
 
04:02:37.610 --> 04:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
and with a 2025 effective date we can do
 
04:02:37.620 --> 04:02:40.309 align:start position:0%
and with a 2025 effective date we can do
that

04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.250 --> 04:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh next spring
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
so we're you would also like to take the
 
04:02:50.330 --> 04:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see what the Federal
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Regulations are how the Federal Federal
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
Regulations are implemented and what the
 
04:02:58.969 --> 04:02:58.979 align:start position:0%
problems with them are because that's
 
04:03:01.010 --> 04:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
where we really want to address the
 
04:03:05.229 --> 04:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I will just say that you know the
 
04:03:10.849 --> 04:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
business Bia was involved in this and
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
they had all the input and they you know
 
04:03:15.290 --> 04:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
didn't uh make those suggestions that
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting I mean as I said this
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
has been worked on for decades with a
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of input so this but this is past
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you so Senator if I'm not
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
mistaken the um part of the reason of
 
04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
putting the 2025 date was to give
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
businesses plenty of notification I
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that offers the house a unique
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity here that if we leave this
 
04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
bill language in it gives you the
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put a bill in next year
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
you could put even the same language
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
work on it and make changes that you
 
04:03:49.849 --> 04:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
could have an effect
 
04:03:52.610 --> 04:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
with the same enactment date or one
 
04:03:54.170 --> 04:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
prior whichever way it would have to be
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
to to overrule what's you know what I
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
mean to make the changes that you might
 
04:04:00.650 --> 04:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
have objections to here but on the same
 
04:04:02.210 --> 04:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
token we're giving the businesses
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
notification that something is coming
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that they need to be ready and able
 
04:04:07.849 --> 04:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
to handle it so that would be my
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that we leave the language
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
here and it gives you a full year of
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce a bill in
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
September if you want to and again you
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
can introduce the same exact Bill and
 
04:04:16.969 --> 04:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
put it through the whole process and
 
04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
work on it
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I appreciate
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
the idea of having that Clarity and
 
04:04:26.150 --> 04:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
transparency of having the law in a fact
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
a year but having the law go into effect
 
04:04:30.170 --> 04:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
a year after it's passed and I
 
04:04:31.729 --> 04:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate that idea of working through
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
but if there's a bill in process in the
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
house and they don't know until until we
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
reach this this point next year what the
 
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
actual law will be I think that that
 
04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
might actually bring more confusion to
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
the employers as opposed to less
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
confusion so I appreciate that that idea
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
but I think it might actually create
 
04:04:52.090 --> 04:04:52.100 align:start position:0%
more confusion
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you madam chair
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
um representative I completely disagree
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
um one of the the two words that I've
 
04:05:00.899 --> 04:05:01.969 align:start position:0%
um one of the the two words that I've
heard

04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
um throughout this is reasonable and and
 
04:05:07.490 --> 04:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
what is sufficient and if we don't have
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
something in here for the State of New
 
04:05:09.300 --> 04:05:10.550 align:start position:0%
something in here for the State of New
Hampshire

04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:05:13.969 --> 04:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
if any if a business has a question
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
um or they have a concern about anything
 
04:05:18.650 --> 04:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
they now have to address it federally
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have a state
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
pathway and it's going to make it much
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
harder and I think it's going to end up
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
being more confusing so that's why I
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
support this amendment being placed on
 
04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
this bill I agree with my colleague from
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate this is not anything new
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
We have dealt with this issue before and
 
04:05:41.570 --> 04:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
I agree that it is time that we do this
 
04:05:44.330 --> 04:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
we want to get women back into the
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
workforce and this is an impediment for
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
them I'm glad the federal government has
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
finally seen how important this is and
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
we do have someone here who can walk us
 
04:05:57.410 --> 04:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
through the federal act if Madam chair
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
would allow her to come forward so that
 
04:06:02.090 --> 04:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
we would have a better idea about what
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's looking what it looks like
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
but um as it stands now I support this
 
04:06:11.090 --> 04:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
provision on this bill
 
04:06:11.100 --> 04:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
provision on this bill
representative

04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not so your suggestion that we added
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
to this we keep it in here and that we
 
04:06:39.290 --> 04:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
go through the process next year of
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
are you saying that any changes in a
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill that we would submit would then be
 
04:06:43.920 --> 04:06:45.290 align:start position:0%
bill that we would submit would then be
overridden

04:06:45.290 --> 04:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
overridden
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
and it would override this yes certainly
 
04:06:48.120 --> 04:06:56.929 align:start position:0%
and it would override this yes certainly
yes

04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.170 --> 04:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
I understand the idea of it and I and I
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
first of all I
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
support the concept of the bill
 
04:07:09.769 --> 04:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's everything that Senator
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
Whitley said I
 
04:07:16.729 --> 04:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm hesitant to put something into
 
04:07:20.760 --> 04:07:21.950 align:start position:0%
but I'm hesitant to put something into
law

04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
and then it gets changed I mean we do
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
this often you know we do something then
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
we go oops we should have done it this
 
04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
way or oops we should have done done it
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:07:33.410 --> 04:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we deal with
 
04:07:34.750 --> 04:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
in our committee all the time
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
specifically in Edna so
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
I'm trying I try after my first term I
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
thought I'm gonna not gonna be a partner
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:07:48.530 --> 04:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
in this crime of
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
04:07:51.180 --> 04:07:51.849 align:start position:0%
of legislation
um

04:07:51.849 --> 04:07:51.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:55.250 --> 04:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
so why is it that
 
04:07:58.490 --> 04:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
it seems strange to me that the Senate
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
didn't put it in the budget and I don't
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
this idea about the policy is fine but
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
we put policy in House Bill too many
 
04:08:06.720 --> 04:08:08.570 align:start position:0%
we put policy in House Bill too many
times

04:08:08.570 --> 04:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much there was a
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
lot of debate about that but my
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that leadership in both
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate for the
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
purposes of passing a budget last budget
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
cycle there was a lot of unnecessary
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
policy and so there was
 
04:08:25.729 --> 04:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of effort to make this a
 
04:08:27.410 --> 04:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
bipartisan budget that didn't have
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
policy in it you know we could have
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
easily slipped this into the budget but
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to House and Senate
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
leadership we did not
 
04:08:35.520 --> 04:08:36.650 align:start position:0%
leadership we did not
so

04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
what that implies to me is that this
 
04:08:41.210 --> 04:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
policy is not firmly supported by House
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
and Senate leadership or they would have
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget
 
04:08:51.790 --> 04:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
this in so far in advance I think that
 
04:08:55.680 --> 04:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
this in so far in advance I think that
we

04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:08:59.090 --> 04:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
I would be much more
 
04:08:59.100 --> 04:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
I would be much more
um

04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
I would be much better
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
pleased if this said that if you went in
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
with the policies all right each
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
employer shall adopt a policy yes yeah
 
04:09:17.929 --> 04:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
we they should and make it available to
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then come back and work out the
 
04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
details because I think the details are
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
not thoroughly worked out and if it's
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
been worked for decades without coming
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion that means there is not
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
solid agreement on what the policy
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
should be so if I might respond yes so
 
04:09:43.010 --> 04:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
with regards to the budget we were asked
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
as chairs to try and not put any policy
 
04:09:48.410 --> 04:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
into the budget if at all possible and
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
and this bill has passed the house twice
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
with 24-0 Excuse me the Senate twice
 
04:09:56.809 --> 04:09:56.819 align:start position:0%
with the 24-0 four times four times I
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
knew it and but I mean in this session
 
04:10:00.290 --> 04:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
this session correct twice we passed it
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
we passed it as part of a greater bill
 
04:10:05.090 --> 04:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
with uh Senate bill 175.
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we took many of those pieces that
 
04:10:09.650 --> 04:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
had Financial components and put them in
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
the budget and the remaining pieces that
 
04:10:13.969 --> 04:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
because we tabled the bill so that we
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
could do that and the remaining policy
 
04:10:17.689 --> 04:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
pieces we put on to other bills just
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
because we felt they were important but
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to stick them in House
 
04:10:23.330 --> 04:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
Bill too we were trying to avoid that
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree ornament as much as
 
04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
possible and do it in a different manner
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
so so the Senate is very committed to
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
this position and has passed it twice
 
04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:35.050 align:start position:0%
this position and has passed it twice
24-0

04:10:35.050 --> 04:10:35.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:37.250 --> 04:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you for
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
that prospective Senator
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the challenge with
 
04:10:41.929 --> 04:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
Christmas trees but I feel like now
 
04:10:43.370 --> 04:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
we're putting on ornaments on every
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
wreath on every door if we're putting
 
04:10:49.370 --> 04:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
these policy sections on other bills my
 
04:10:50.570 --> 04:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
biggest concern Remains The
 
04:10:52.969 --> 04:10:52.979 align:start position:0%
implementation of the federal law and if
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
we can pause and look and see what
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
happens and see if we can address those
 
04:10:58.729 --> 04:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
differences and those deficiencies in
 
04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
federal law in a way that's very New
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific as they go as players
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
go through and adopt these policies
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
which they'll need to in order to be in
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
compliance and we can figure out figure
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
out where we can better serve our people
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
and and Nuance the federal law to serve
 
04:11:17.210 --> 04:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
Granite State moms I think that
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
I think that it's important to take the
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
time to do it in a way that also has the
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
buy-in of the Full House as opposed to
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
coming through a committee of conference
 
04:11:25.010 --> 04:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
because while this is passed the Senate
 
04:11:26.929 --> 04:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
many times it has not yet passed the
 
04:11:29.330 --> 04:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
house for various reasons in various
 
04:11:29.340 --> 04:11:31.130 align:start position:0%
house for various reasons in various
years

04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
yes and would
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable to say that
 
04:11:41.150 --> 04:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
immediately we should pass on page 20 of
 
04:11:45.410 --> 04:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
the okay there's there's policies
 
04:11:47.929 --> 04:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
every employer shall adopt a policy
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
every employer shall make this available
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
to their employees
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that they need to know
 
04:11:57.530 --> 04:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
right now that we're going to be doing
 
04:12:02.090 --> 04:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
they need to know that a year in advance
 
04:12:04.560 --> 04:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
they need to know that a year in advance
not

04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:12:06.720 --> 04:12:07.550 align:start position:0%
not
um

04:12:07.550 --> 04:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
clean space sheltered sheltered from you
 
04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
I mean it's there's a lot of
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative they may so I
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
our businesses told us as we worked on
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
this that they don't know what a
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable break period is they don't
 
04:12:31.370 --> 04:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
know what a sufficient space is so if we
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
just say pass apology do this without
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
any structure I think that would provide
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
so much more confusion to our employers
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
also we are wanna we are the only state
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
in New England that does not have state
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
level protections so I will say
 
04:12:48.530 --> 04:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
employers are very used to this language
 
04:12:50.689 --> 04:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
and I think New Hampshire is making a
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
very strong statement if we don't pass
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.199 --> 04:12:57.229 align:start position:0%

04:22:10.800 --> 04:22:12.650 align:start position:0%
 
we've

04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:22:14.990 --> 04:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
agreed that since there is time to
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%

04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill that we will agree to include
 
04:22:24.370 --> 04:22:24.380 align:start position:0%
it in house bill 358. if that's okay
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:32.210 --> 04:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
I will prepare an amendment deleting
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 42.
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
all right everyone everyone in agreement
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
Madam chair do you want to make the
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
change suggested by representative on
 
04:22:50.210 --> 04:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
page 20.
 
04:22:55.490 --> 04:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
oh yes that's right we're uh yes
 
04:22:57.769 --> 04:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
so it could read on the last line a
 
04:23:01.610 --> 04:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
nursing employee shall notify
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
in writing yeah or we could in line with
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
the employer's policy yeah I think that
 
04:23:08.809 --> 04:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
was the language but then maybe we put
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
that Clause after let me say I'm
 
04:23:12.769 --> 04:23:12.779 align:start position:0%
notified some player
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
at least two weeks maybe we should put
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
the closet back up with something that
 
04:23:20.450 --> 04:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
adds adds that you know that the
 
04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
notification is in the proper style to
 
04:23:22.620 --> 04:23:23.630 align:start position:0%
notification is in the proper style to
be

04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%

something else we need to look at on
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill so if you'd bring it if you
 
04:32:17.809 --> 04:32:17.819 align:start position:0%

04:32:19.969 --> 04:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
right there is
 
04:32:19.979 --> 04:32:21.530 align:start position:0%

04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
a what we'd like to do is on the bottom
 
04:32:28.729 --> 04:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
of page 10 line 37 6 and 37 which of
 
04:32:30.530 --> 04:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
course I don't have that bill in front
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
of me we wanted to um include a sentence
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
what would you read the title because
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're we don't have pages on ours on the
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
on the side by side oh okay let me let
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%

oops
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
it has to do with um experts qualified
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
experts so let me see if I can that's
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
the part I'm looking for it's what it
 
04:32:59.450 --> 04:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
has to do with qualified experts right
 
04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
oh I'm on the wrong
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm on 358 let me go to 409.
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
ah okay
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
did you find it on the uh it's on uh
 
04:33:16.589 --> 04:33:16.599 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in the middle somewhere
 
04:33:16.599 --> 04:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in the middle somewhere
[Laughter]

04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
is it the section that says the office
 
04:33:23.631 --> 04:33:23.641 align:start position:0%
shell employee sufficient correct
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel qualified by reason of
 
04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
Education competence and relative
 
04:33:30.410 --> 04:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
experience yes what section is that in
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's Roman four
 
04:33:39.289 --> 04:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
and it's in 310 10 Roman 4.
 
04:33:44.810 --> 04:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.330 --> 04:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
at the top of the page yes okay so
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
what's the concern with that one I
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to see so the sentence I wanted
 
04:33:54.170 --> 04:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
to read to modify the sentence to read
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
retain qualified experts appointed by
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
the executive director in accordance
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
with criteria established by the board
 
04:34:01.799 --> 04:34:04.369 align:start position:0%
with criteria established by the board
ah

04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:34:07.010 --> 04:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
um oh this is this is not for
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
prosecutors this is for investigators
 
04:34:12.410 --> 04:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
yes all right then then I gave you the
 
04:34:14.631 --> 04:34:14.641 align:start position:0%
wrong citation it's probably before that
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.529 --> 04:34:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.849 --> 04:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
is it under complaints and
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
investigations which should be under
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
so that is three ten nine no it's not
 
04:34:42.849 --> 04:34:42.859 align:start position:0%
three it's three ten it's three ten nine
 
04:34:45.650 --> 04:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.960 --> 04:34:55.970 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.970 --> 04:34:57.650 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:57.660 --> 04:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
well there's three ten nine and then
 
04:35:03.769 --> 04:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
there's there's room oh investigations
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
retain qualified experts that have
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient knowledge on a statute to
 
04:35:11.689 --> 04:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
professions and their practices
 
04:35:15.051 --> 04:35:15.061 align:start position:0%
is that um yes instead of that ah okay
 
04:35:19.090 --> 04:35:19.100 align:start position:0%
so we have retained qualified experts
 
04:35:22.131 --> 04:35:22.141 align:start position:0%
appointed by the executive director in
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
accordance with criteria established by
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:35:26.100 --> 04:35:27.769 align:start position:0%
the board
so

04:35:27.769 --> 04:35:27.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.340 --> 04:35:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:36.650 --> 04:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in this section is we
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
are giving
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the oplc staff Authority and so it says
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
to carry out investigations the
 
04:35:46.631 --> 04:35:46.641 align:start position:0%
executive director is authorized to
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
retain qualified experts right and so I
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
just don't know if we need appointed by
 
04:35:55.131 --> 04:35:55.141 align:start position:0%
the executive director I think it's more
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
that yeah it should say according to
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
well we're giving her the authority to
 
04:36:12.529 --> 04:36:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.051 --> 04:36:18.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.061 --> 04:36:22.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that's where I mean that's where the
 
04:36:26.810 --> 04:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
language came from her concerns that had
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
been brought up okay so instead of just
 
04:36:32.631 --> 04:36:32.641 align:start position:0%
saying that have sufficient knowledge on
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
statutes or professions should say
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
according to criteria established by the
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
board yes okay
 
04:36:44.810 --> 04:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify if I may so part of
 
04:36:46.369 --> 04:36:46.379 align:start position:0%
what we discussed in committee was sort
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
of like the division between staff and
 
04:36:48.299 --> 04:36:50.570 align:start position:0%
of like the division between staff and
board

04:36:50.570 --> 04:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
and I think I've discussed this with
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative and I think I think we're
 
04:36:56.449 --> 04:36:56.459 align:start position:0%
on the same page which is that
 
04:36:59.170 --> 04:36:59.180 align:start position:0%
you know the board really sort of
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
retains substantive duties with the
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
executive director kind of retains
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
procedural ones but it was important
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
that they have sort of independent
 
04:37:09.529 --> 04:37:09.539 align:start position:0%
authority to hire investigators so I
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we've sort of
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
fully thoughts I I think the point of
 
04:37:17.570 --> 04:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
this is that the boards say we need to
 
04:37:17.580 --> 04:37:19.250 align:start position:0%
this is that the boards say we need to
have

04:37:19.250 --> 04:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know a child psychologist
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with this the this area and
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
then the board then the director hires
 
04:37:26.520 --> 04:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
then the board then the director hires
one

04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
it doesn't the board doesn't approve who
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
the executive director is hiring it's
 
04:37:33.769 --> 04:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
just that they're setting the criteria
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
for what those expert witness experts
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for like I'd say
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's somebody who has
 
04:37:41.039 --> 04:37:41.929 align:start position:0%
it's somebody who has
um

04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
somebody that's involved let's say it's
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
a medical issue and it's a thoracic
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
issue right then it would be somebody
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
who's involved with whatever that part
 
04:37:52.260 --> 04:37:53.330 align:start position:0%
who's involved with whatever that part
of

04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
medicine medicine is those would be
 
04:37:58.010 --> 04:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
experts that have expertise in those
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
areas and the executive director may not
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that for every
 
04:38:05.929 --> 04:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
profession yeah and also that gives the
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
once you have the criteria
 
04:38:11.689 --> 04:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
it's easier for for the office to pick
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
somebody that won't create as much of a
 
04:38:16.490 --> 04:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest as if the board did
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
it yeah if I may I as I recall on this
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
and I may have to rely on Mr osaw a
 
04:38:23.090 --> 04:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
little bit because he filled Us in on
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
this uh if my memory serves me correctly
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
we were trying to draw a clear
 
04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
distinction between the investigator and
 
04:38:32.631 --> 04:38:32.641 align:start position:0%
the adjudicator right and by allowing
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
the board to do that in essence it'd be
 
04:38:37.131 --> 04:38:37.141 align:start position:0%
like giving the agility the ability to
 
04:38:39.170 --> 04:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
decide and have some input on who the
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses were that were coming
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
in and I think that was an area of
 
04:38:44.810 --> 04:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
concern that we were trying to stay away
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
from well that's why the language says
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
according to criteria established by the
 
04:38:52.970 --> 04:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
board because the board knows what
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
criteria are important
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
and this is for the investigator it
 
04:38:58.849 --> 04:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be unfair to the person being
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
investigated that the board is deciding
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
what expert Witnesses they'd like to no
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's not what expert what is the time
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
the criteria expert Witnesses you'd have
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
to offer that same thing that same
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
ability to the person being investigated
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
because that's the whole point of having
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
in my opinion of having the investigator
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the jury in essence they're two
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
separate things yeah well this is the
 
04:39:25.490 --> 04:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
investigator and the board says we need
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
someone familiar with this profession
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
and this whatever else they establish
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
and they
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
the office says okay go we'll go find
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
somebody that meets those criteria would
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
it be okay if we asked Mr O's to help
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
for an opinion on it all right we will
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
ask our uh the the attorney for the oplc
 
04:39:48.770 --> 04:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
because I I think it it is a good idea
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
to have the board establish what type of
 
04:39:59.208 --> 04:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's our understanding that
 
04:40:04.010 --> 04:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
like you were saying representative grow
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
to that if the board sets those criteria
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't necessarily have to go
 
04:40:09.948 --> 04:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
to the board for approval of that
 
04:40:11.330 --> 04:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
individual but we would look at those
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
criteria and say this is what the expert
 
04:40:16.490 --> 04:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
we hire these are the criteria they need
 
04:40:18.130 --> 04:40:18.140 align:start position:0%
to meet but we could still act
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
procedurally independently of the board
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
as long as that individual met those
 
04:40:26.208 --> 04:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
criteria you'd be okay with that change
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
I am okay with that change John and I
 
04:40:30.970 --> 04:40:30.980 align:start position:0%
were just talking I do have one concern
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
that there might what happens if the
 
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
board hasn't set criteria
 
04:40:38.570 --> 04:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh he's of the opinion that if there's
 
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
no criteria oplc could just go
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
I would think that's the case okay and
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
we could clarify that right if the board
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
is not set right here yet then sure if
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
none then then the opalc decides okay
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we almost could solve it
 
04:40:56.570 --> 04:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
with an or I mean if it says routine
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
qualified experts according to criteria
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
established by the board or oh that's
 
04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
fine yeah that works too but even better
 
04:41:04.490 --> 04:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
04:41:12.670 --> 04:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
or all right so
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
to continue we have
 
04:41:20.280 --> 04:41:21.288 align:start position:0%
to continue we have
um

04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:23.570 --> 04:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
a second advanced practice registered
 
04:41:26.690 --> 04:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
nurse on the board of of nursing delete
 
04:41:32.090 --> 04:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
the specific Nursing education member
 
04:41:32.100 --> 04:41:36.970 align:start position:0%
the specific Nursing education member
um

04:41:36.970 --> 04:41:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.530 --> 04:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
changing 310.5 to match the Senate Bill
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
49 language right so we're changing the
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
five billion to three million yeah and
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
make sure all the other language is
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
there we're going to make this change
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
on the investigators
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
and like anything else
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's the effective date
 
04:41:56.700 --> 04:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's the effective date
yes

04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
um to 7 15 is that 7 15 yeah two changes
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
about the Board of Nursing right yep
 
04:42:06.050 --> 04:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
I think that leaves was only one point
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
of contention right that's section 27
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate feels very strongly that this
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
language is good and that this compact
 
04:42:21.770 --> 04:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
needs to be in place
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
we do respect that the house has a
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
we understand that you're working on it
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
and you have a bill retained
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's that doesn't give us necessarily
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
the Assurance we were hoping to get that
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
we could get something through because
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
my feeling is you're going to have the
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
same problems in September when you're
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
working on retain bills that you have in
 
04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
June because there won't be any rules
 
04:42:49.490 --> 04:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
established by September either
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I did I'm concerned that
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
it puts all of this language at Jeopardy
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
in this whole Social Work compact in
 
04:42:57.958 --> 04:42:59.150 align:start position:0%
in this whole Social Work compact in
jeopardy

04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
in the interim I have spoken with oplc
 
04:43:07.010 --> 04:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
about the potential of getting social
 
04:43:07.020 --> 04:43:08.810 align:start position:0%
about the potential of getting social
workers

04:43:08.810 --> 04:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh the reciprocity that we passed under
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
594. that will impact them potentially
 
04:43:19.128 --> 04:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
some so I guess we are taking a little
 
04:43:21.650 --> 04:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
bit of ease with knowing that we're
 
04:43:23.208 --> 04:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
going to help the situation as it
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
we aren't again we aren't happy about
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
removing this language
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
in the least we felt very strongly that
 
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
it needed to be there and voted very
 
04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate to have it
 
04:43:38.930 --> 04:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
but we also feel that the remainder of
 
04:43:40.610 --> 04:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
the language in 409 is critically
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
important as we move forward and
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
Implement 655 and
 
04:43:45.120 --> 04:43:49.010 align:start position:0%
Implement 655 and
594.

04:43:49.010 --> 04:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:51.170 --> 04:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
so with
 
04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
some hesitation and a bit of unhappiness
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
we will
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
agree to remove this part to save the
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill but I will say that
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to very much be looking to
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
you and encouraging you to look at this
 
04:44:04.970 --> 04:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
language in the retained bill that you
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
have and make sure something good
 
04:44:12.288 --> 04:44:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
