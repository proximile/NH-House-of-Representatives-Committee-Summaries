all

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
right I guess I could be a substitute
 
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:34.389 align:start position:0%
right I guess I could be a substitute
for

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll take up 353
 
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.629 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll take up 353
first

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
so um so who do I have here for 353
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
hand

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's not
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
exactly accurate okay what you're
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
because you're the one who wanted us to
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
have this discussion right I'm I'm sorry
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear that you're the one who
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay so tell us tell us so I was you the
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
only one in the
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
room go for it so I've been talking to
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh gateways who is here last week I mean
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
the last time when we had the uh thing
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
and they're having people that have been
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
turned away for insurance coverage
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
for uh Down syndrome behavioral therapy
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
things and the problem that we've been
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
seeing is that a a number of down
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
syndrome kids and we're not talking
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
about a lot because we only have 20 kids
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
a year born in the state with
 
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.069 align:start position:0%
a year born in the state with
Downs

00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
Downs
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh that they aren not necessarily
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
autistic and and that's the clear code
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
that that's in the statutes right now
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
you you need to be down syndrome with
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
autism in order to get covered
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the behavioral therapy that we're
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
talking about except that in talking to
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
department we may have an issue that
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
we're not using the right codes that
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
there may be other codes that are
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
applicable in other words you don't have
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
to be downs and you could be something
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
else and so I wanted to ask them to come
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
in and talk about just for a few seconds
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
what is possible what kind of an
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
investigation can they look at to find
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
out where the issue might be because
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
there may these folks may be covered and
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:44.910 align:start position:0%
we don't know
it

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
so hello good morning I'm Michelle
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
Heaton I'm the director of Life and
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
Health at the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
department so to give a little bit of
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
background um on this issue the new um
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has their
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
consumer services hotline and complaint
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
process and we receive complaints all
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
the time about a variety of different
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
issues we work with consumers to resolve
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
the issues when there's regulatory
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
violations and provide them with
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
information even if it's a plan that we
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
do not regulate um to date we have not
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
really received any complaints regarding
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
this issue about um coverage for kids
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
with Down syndrome and things not being
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
covered so from that respect we're not
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
really sure where the breakdown is some
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
of so we would encourage anyone who's
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
having problems with coverage that's
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance coverage please
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
come to us and file these complaints so
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
we can help them work through the
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
process um as I was talking to
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative spe um one of the issues
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
is this is going to be very fact
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
specific so it depends on you know the
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
type of insurance it the type of
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
coverage um making sure that it is
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial plan what are the
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
um symptoms that the child's
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
experiencing what type of services are
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
they trying to access are those services
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
in network there's a lot of different
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
variables so without you know the
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
individual complaints it's kind of hard
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
to just put out general information to
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
help people um one of the things we can
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
do but again it's a very small
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
population we're talking about here so I
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that there was necessarily
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
anything in our claims database but we
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
could look up um some claims information
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
and see kind of if things are being
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
denied and the reasons for those denials
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
um another issue is that
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
if if a child is going to Aba therapy
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
then the coverage yeah could depend on
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
how it's being coded to be submitted so
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
it could be that there are children with
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
Down Syndrome getting the ABA therapy
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
but maybe they're duly diagnosed and it
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
was coded as autism and there's no
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
reference to Down syndrome so we're not
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily see that in the
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
claims um database so um that could be
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
something that you ask us to do would be
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
to do um a study to look at coverage for
 
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
to do um a study to look at coverage for
Down

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
Down
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
syndrome um or coverage for services for
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
children with Down syndrome and at the
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
denial rates and see if we can come up
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
with any reasons but again when we're
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
talking about a really small population
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
we just don't really know we have't we
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
may have looked at this I'm not sure I'd
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look um because it's
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
been a while since we were talking about
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
this bill we may have done some initial
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
work on it but um nothing really stuck
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
out if we did but we can go back and
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
revisit that and see is is there you
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
know certain codes that are having a
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
higher denial rate but um there are
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
limits in our data because of the small
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
population here and in the way it's been
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
coded so it could be being coded in a
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
way that is being covered and it's not
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to show up as a denial in our
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
system so really the best way would be
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
if there are people being denied
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
coverage file complaint we can work
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
through the specifics of that case okay
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
I have some uh people that have work
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
with gateways you know who they are
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're they deal with Down syndrome and
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
autism kids and and adults and I think I
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
can get them to give me some people we
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
can touch base with to find out how
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
they've been denied or whatever and then
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
you could possibly work through what
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
happened yeah we'd be happy to do that
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
and we do that all the time for Anytime
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's coverage issues who is helping
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
providers and consumers work through how
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
do we get coverage for this is there
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
coverage is this covered why or why not
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
but at this point without having a
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
specific belly button as it were as we
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
say in the biz
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh you don't think it's worthwhile to go
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
looking at data just on any kind of
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
thing you could look at uh proactively
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we could but I don't know I
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
mean without looking it's more Jason's
 
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.430 align:start position:0%
mean without looking it's more Jason's
territory

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
territory
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure how much data
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
there's going to be there and if it's
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
really going to tell us where the issue
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
is because it's a small population I
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
think the most efficient way would
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
probably be reaching out to those people
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
sending them our way and giving us some
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
specifics so that we can look at those
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
specifics and find out what exactly is
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
going on there okay I will do that thank
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
you okay so um that's great um so the
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
only thing just to uh educate myself
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
what what is it that we do cover now
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
what is a what's in our statue what's
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
the ways is it uh is autism treated as a
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
mental health issue or is it treated as
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
a physical so for all commercial plans
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment must be covered
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
so that covers it's treated as mental
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
health it is treated as mental health um
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
autism is is a mental health disorder
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
that there is treatment and that's where
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
typically ABA therapy is used okay it's
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
in the DSM right yep okay and when we're
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
talking about um Down syndrome there are
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
a variety of different treatments
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
depending on um the particular issues
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
that the individual is experiencing so
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
we do also mandate um early intervention
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
services for all children so anytime
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's developmental delays I vaguely
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
remember that statute yeah so anytime
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's developmental delays um that
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
would cover speech language um
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
therapy um occupational therapy Physical
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
Therapy a lot of those issu issues that
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
also kind of overlap sometimes with
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
autism so anytime there's developmental
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
Down syndrome or down syndome to down so
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
it it depends on what type of issues the
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
child or individual is experiencing but
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the most part we already have
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
mandates in place and this would be all
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
part of the essential health benefits
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
that are required in the individual and
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
small group so as far as you're
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
concerned in terms of the the mandates
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
we've already done in terms of the
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
mental health a and then B that in terms
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
of early
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
intervention and early intervention that
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've already passed we already have a
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
health a mandate already on the statutes
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so if there are gaps I we want to
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
work through those because it could be
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
something just not being coded right or
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's not being submitted properly but if
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
there is a misunderstanding maybe with
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
carriers and what they need to cover
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to issue additional
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
guidance to clarify to the extent
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
there's any what you just said was very
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
important I think if the
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner doesn't know what all the
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
code what the appropriate codes are they
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
may not be coding it right so you have
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to go out and tell them you
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
know you're supposed to be using these
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
codes or for these conditions and those
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
kind of things yeah in the past we've
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
issued bulletins um we've done a couple
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
recently with respect to mental health
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
um mental health practitioners and uh
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
Primary Care behavioral health model
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
issuing guidance of you know these are
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
generally the types of codes and direct
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
carriers to make sure their providers
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
know the proper codes to use to um have
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
those claims
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
covered because sometimes it can vary
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
too by the insurance carrier and in
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
their provider contract and manual it
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
usually specifies how they um need to
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
code stuff to have things covered so the
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh early intervention statute um would
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
you mind tonight emailing me that RSA
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
just to remind me because I think we
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
should be put that in the blur in our in
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
our the committee report that we should
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
say that the statute does exist and if
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
it is not being effective for if if some
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners feel that that this is not
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
doing what it's doing then then we need
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
we we need to be brought to our
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
attention the Department's attention so
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
we can address it so that if futureal
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
legislation would be if if it became
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
clear that that statute is somehow not
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
covering um these kids yep I'll will be
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
happy to do that and sense get i'll s to
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
both of you yeah well I'm looking for
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
you you know
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
to to write the uh the committee report
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
okay and so I'm giving you something to
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
put in that committee report I'm writing
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
the report yeah yeah you tag your at
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay then okay so but that and in it I
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
want you to put in how you know that we
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
need the communication to the department
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
on you know where where there has been a
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
problem with when somebody got a
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
rejection or whatever they need to
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
commit Comm unicate that and um and but
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
more importantly that we we already have
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
a statute for Early
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
Intervention when we say early
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
intervention how many years old are we
 
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.750 align:start position:0%
intervention how many years old are we
talking

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
about um I think our specific mandate
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
statute goes
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
from birth until three years old but um
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
it would still be covered as part of
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
essential health benefits so our early
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
intervention statute is part of our
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
Benchmark plan and was um in place prior
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the ACA but um the general um ehb
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
requirements would require those covered
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
past those services to be covered past
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
three years to the extent that they're
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
medically necessary I think at some
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
point and it would probably depend on
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
the child but once they get to a certain
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
age I think and I'm not a doctor so I
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
could be a little off on this but those
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
interventions are not as um successful
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
after a certain age so I think that's
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
why back in the day we had put that
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
three years but um essential health
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
benefits would have to require beyond
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
that three years to the extent it's
 
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.549 align:start position:0%
that three years to the extent it's
medically

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
medically
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
necessary you'll write that in an email
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
to help her
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
out yes I will follow up with an email
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
do I use this you're going to have to
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
tell me how to what goes into one of
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
these reports I have no I've never seen
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
one okay well oh okay that is true so
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
basically the motion is either you know
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation so we we're pretty
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
much uniformally everything is going to
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
be not recommended because it it well I
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
want to see what there is for us right
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
what you say is is that as as the bill
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
has written as it is right now all right
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
it this no we don't recommend this what
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
we the committee does recommend what we
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
do feel so strongly in support is we
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
need better communication from providers
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh refusals from insurance
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
company to communicate with the
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
department and so that and so then then
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
the department will know whether we need
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
to look at um this the statue in the
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
future years but there was there was one
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
piece I want wanted to the one piece
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
where I go and find somebody who has
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
been denied and the insurance department
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
tells me why they were denied good luck
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
finding that person I I I do think I
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
have access you think you have right
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
okay gateways tell tells me that they
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
will provide those people right right
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we'd be happy to work through them
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure coverage is appropriately
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
let's see what they come up with
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
happening and to the extent that there's
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
any um confusion about what's required
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're happy to follow up with
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
the carriers to make sure they
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the law is and they're
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
following it but to the extent if we
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
find something that is some kind of Gap
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
and off the top of my head I'm not
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
seeing where that would be but if we do
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
find that you know we'll definitely be
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
coming back to close that loophole with
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
you guys so what you're you just
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
volunteered for is that you're going to
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
go find a real life story and you're
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
going to get it to the department and
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
then once you've seen once the
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
Department's got it and once you've
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with it then the department can
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
come back in a couple weeks and tell
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
us okay so that it has to happen by
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
before October 17th that you need to
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay okay exactly no I said put it put
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
the pedal in the metal and and get see
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
what you can you can you can get and
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
that way we'll have a real life
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
antidotal story on how um what's going
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
on and if I can't get anybody that then
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
we'll just go with what we said before
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
about the uh about the essential health
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
benefits and the early intervention and
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
all the rest of that correct okay that
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
seem make
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
sense okay thank you very
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
much I think all right we'll move on
 
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:50.190 align:start position:0%
much I think all right we'll move on
from

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
1571 okay so who's here from
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
all right um so I I see the sponsors
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
here so why don't you come on up
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
days before we had these microphones and
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
cameras and you know let's say be
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
pre-o uh when when Commerce had
 
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.549 align:start position:0%
pre-o uh when when Commerce had
subcommittees

00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't be sitting in our seats
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
we would all be sitting in a corner and
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
we all be kind of collect together and
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
we and it's a
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
conversation right people are not
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
testifying it's a conversation and it's
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
a back and forth and try to figure out
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know where we are where we should go
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know what's the right answer here so
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
um we'll try to treat it like that but
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
obviously we have microphones so
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody at home can watch so turn your
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
microphone on and okay so um if I
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
understand this bill
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
correctly is that um anybody can test
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
their blood
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
sugars yes and I I I'm just I don't know
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
if you right I I was just pre just uh
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with pre-diabetic I'm 6.4 in
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
my A1C and uh and so now I I went out
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and bought a fast kit um which
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
everything was real cheap until they see
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
how much they charge for the little the
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
tabs and I found I said how do people
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
afford this he said well most people get
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
their insurance comps to pay for
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
it but they wouldn't pay it for me
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetic problem number one I got to
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
get my A1C at the
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
6.5 then they will pay for those those
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
tabs and boy the prices are all over the
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
of these little tabby things it was the
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
package is 50 and um both U Walmart was
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
even more expensive than than uh than
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
who was the it was the was the pharmacy
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
Walgreens they were like
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
$80 and for them and uh then but then I
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
found I got I can get them from Amazon
 
00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:21.310 align:start position:0%
found I got I can get them from Amazon
for

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
40 so you did your homework very well
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
chairman right yeah so I I do know the
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
price is though so the issue now is that
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay so we that theoretically anybody
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
who's already a diabetic has been is can
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
get test kits for free okay that's
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm could I respond
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so you can get test kits for free
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
if you have insurance coverage right and
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
um it is recommended that you do that I
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say everybody's getting a test
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
kit no I'm saying people could right
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
when I and then you know obviously this
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
summer I talk to people and I'm I'm
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
amazed the amount of people who test
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
first start testing really religiously
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
and then after a while they decline in
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
they're testing themselves and we know
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
that that is a very common circumstance
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
that when people are first diagnosed
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
with diabetes they're generally quite
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
concerned and um probably
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
scared and compliance with recommended
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
testing is pretty good
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then over time people do it less and
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons people do it less is
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's not particularly comfortable to
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
finger stick over and over it's it's a
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
small finger stick it literally is less
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
than a pin prick in a way it is a pin
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
print but your fingers do get more
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
sensitive over time and depending
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
on how much information is beneficial to
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
that patient and how um inconsistent
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
their blood sugars are the more
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent their blood sugars are the
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
more frequently they should check to
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
help inform how they're managing their
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes and depending on what type of
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
Diabetes you have and how it's
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
treated it might be recommended I'm not
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
exaggerating to test your blood sugar a
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
dozen times a day well that's more than
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
one finger per
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
finger for the rest of your life um so
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
there are finger stick monitoring is
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
very informative very valuable
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
and not without
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
problems right cuz the the difference
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
between the the blood sugars versus A1C
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
the A1C is looking at that whole your
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's much more Global and
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
so I do have my test next week and and
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
I'll be testing my a andc and because I
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
put myself on on that fora
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
and depending on how your body is
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
responding to your good attention to
 
00:30:58.399 --> 00:30:59.950 align:start position:0%
responding to your good attention to
addressing

00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
this A1C is a good broad measure of how
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
well someone's diabetes is being
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
managed targeting to get it under six or
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
5.8 is I've been retired a couple years
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to verify that I
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
remembered the numbers correctly
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
um sometimes though A1C doesn't
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
represent the irregularity of blood
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
sugars throughout the
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
day it's not exactly an average but it
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
sort of acts like an average and so if
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
you're having a lot of high numbers and
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of low numbers your A1C could
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually be reasonable but you're not
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
feeling very good and you're not
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
preventing complications you're not well
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
so A1C is useful but without frequent
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
awareness of your fluctuating blood
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
sugar CA fluctuation it's not enough to
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
say you're doing the job your pancre is
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
not working at certain times of the day
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
okay so these monitors that are
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
everybody wants that you want do one I
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
assume this legislation is your
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
mandating that anybody should be able to
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
get one of these so it said whether it
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
didn't say pre-diabetic didn't say
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
diabetic it looked like it was pretty
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
wide open yes so the intent of the bill
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
is that whatever approach to blood sugar
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring the patient would benefit
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
from would be covered so the bill draft
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
includes the testing that you're
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
describing with a device and a
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
disposable test strip you can only get
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
one blood sugar result per strip right
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
so as you note the cost of them becomes
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
very significant over time the cost of
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
the devices is not a big deal to most
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
people 25 bucks it's the
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing test strips um so the intent of
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is to cover both the that
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
option those options and to cover
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitors which are
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
wearable devices they're essentially the
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
size of a quarter how much are those um
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to can I invite Liz
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
yes oh absolutely Liz come on up help me
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
out um so the cgms attach they penetrate
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
the skin slightly right um depending on
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
the device you wear them for 7 to 14
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
days and then replace them and you can
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
read your blood sugar from that
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
instantly I can just take my phone and
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
go like that and it tells me what it is
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now no finger prick
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
involved right now in regard to cost
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's uh you know these continuous
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitors have been updated
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
over the years so I'm going to give you
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the cost of the Dexcom 7 which is the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
most recent one and also the freestyle
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
lebre which is a which is another one
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
produced by another company and the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
average retail price for a pack of three
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
sensors which is a 30-day Supply is
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
between $152 and
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
$35 depending where it's
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
purchased so it really it literally can
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
vary from Pharmacy to pharmacy because
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
many of these devices are are sold
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
within pharmacies uh Costco price a lot
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
of individuals have gone to Costco if
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
they have a membership there uh is
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
$185 um good RX which is a place that a
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
lot of us look at when we're trying to
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
get economical um uh devices is about uh
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
$72 um $72 for for a for a 30-day Supply
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
$72 for 30 days yes okay now if we go to
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
the freestyle Libre which is made by uh
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
Abbott the price of that one through
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
Costco is a for one pack of two sensors
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
these can actually be worn for 14 days
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
okay um the cost of that uh again
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
through Costco is about
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
$170 and through good RX it's about
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
$80 okay so I would just
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
encourage factor that out over a year
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
times the rest of your
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
life um so I took the initial 152 that
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
Liz said for the Dexcom for 30 days
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
that's over $1,800 a year for that
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
sensor it's extremely valuable to the
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
patient and frankly to the Health Care
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
system because we're reducing
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
complications that are very expensive
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
and very much adverse effect on quality
 
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.710 align:start position:0%
and very much adverse effect on quality
of

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
life but it's a lot of money for people
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
to keep up with and I would also note
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
that while sensors have
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
improved they do sometimes fail they
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't always say stuck on and you can't
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
reapply that sensor when it comes
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
detached you have to get a new one so
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers per month are the least
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
amount per month that it would be
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
right the other thing is is for each of
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
the sensors um it could communicate
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
medicate your blood sugar in two
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
different ways one of them is a thing
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
called a reader which is a device that
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you put it up against your sensor and
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
it reads your blood sugar uh those
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
average about anywhere from $150 to $200
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
a year or if a person has got a
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
compatible cell phone okay they can
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually have that information
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
downloaded into their cell phone uh and
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
it allows you know individuals know
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
where their blood sugar is but it would
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
also let's say we have someone who has
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
some cognitive impairment for some
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
reason it would allow another individual
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
to also know where that blood sugar is
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
and then get in contact with the person
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
who's cognitively impaired and if you
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
know the blood sugar is going too high
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
what's going on have you taken your
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
medicine would wouldn't they be getting
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
an insulin pump at that point wouldn't
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
they no no no let's say we have somebody
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
what percentage of people have insulin
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
pffs what it's a rather small so what's
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
the diff so I me because Mo I think when
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
even when I first saw this leg
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation I was thinking it was
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
insulin pump I didn't realize it was
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
just testing okay so the question is um
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
do insurance companies cover what do
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
they cover
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
now okay the the insurance companies
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh Will C cover insulin pumps and
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
they will also cover CGM continuous
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitoring yeah if you
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
meet certain criteria
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
6.5 a A1c 6.5 yes and an A1C 6 so this
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is only for all those people
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetics no because one of the
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
other uh requirements for insurance
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
coverage is usually you have to be
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
treated with insulin and
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
the majority put the
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
mic one of the other requirements of
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to cover cgms
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
generally is you have to be treated with
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
insulin and the majority of people with
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetes and everybody with
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes are not treated with
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
insulin yeah but how how what what what
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
is the threshold that insurance
 
00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:19.950 align:start position:0%
is the threshold that insurance
companies

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
accept the threshold if it's not 6.5
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
which I was told you are correct about
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
that but that's only one of the factors
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
to so you saying insurance company has
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
another requirement other than 6.5 so
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
let's say your A1C is 7.2 okay so you
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
meet the threshold that you've just
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
noted right but you're a person with
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes who is not being treated with
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
insulin you are being treated with some
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
other medication that may oral maybe
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
metformin or maybe an injectable
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
medication but it's not
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
insulin we're very fortunate
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
today um you you began this meeting
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
going back in time to the pre-co days if
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
I go back in time to my early days as a
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator in the 1980s and 1990s
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't have very many tools in the
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
toolbox for treating diabetes now we
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot more pharmaceutical options
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
that work extremely
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
well but one of the trade-offs of
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
working very well to control blood sugar
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
is the patient needs to be very aware
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
not to have it overcorrect and go too
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
low and of course there are a lot of
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
variables that affect blood sugar what
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
you eat how much you eat your stress
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
level your activity level how well you
 
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.390 align:start position:0%
level your activity level how well you
slept

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
slept
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
um hormone changes with monthly
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
Cycles um I mean there's like a list of
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
25 variables that affect blood sugar
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
those are the most common ones that I
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
just said so even if somebody takes the
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
same medication dose and time day after
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
day after day and appears to have a
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
fairly predictable routine you know
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a 9 to-5 death job their
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
activity doesn't fluctuate a lot on
 
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
activity doesn't fluctuate a lot on
those

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
weekdays even so their blood sugar could
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
be less predictable than you would
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
expect it to be and if they
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
can't efficiently and affordably monitor
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
it then they can't respond to those
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
changes in blood sugar in a safe and
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
timely manner so the insurance coverage
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you have type 1 diabetes meaning you
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
must be taking insulin to treat it is
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
good but insurance coverage for people
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
for testing supplies is not good at all
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's not consistent it's not uh adequate
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
but it's it's preventative
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
medicine all right this is not curing
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
you this is preent this is getting you
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge knowledge is you know
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
important knowing your status knowing
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
what your what's going on is important
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
okay but that when you look at our
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance mandates and that's
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill is this is a health
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
insurance mandate when you look at our
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
mandates our mandates were where
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
insurance was uh that we had decided
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
that this was a something that really
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
needed to happen and insurance companies
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
were erratic in enforcement so you take
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
the most famous one which is
 
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.309 align:start position:0%
the most famous one which is
uh

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
monographies okay we mandate
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
mography and because we think it's so
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
important there's no co-pays or
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
deductible from
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy okay these are preventative
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
medicines they're preventative
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
treatments they definitely have a uh and
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I would say I was been here on Long
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
long enough I remember when the bill the
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
issue was that the that the mamography
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
was it had to be a year and a day you
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
know the get had to be a year and
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
a day you know that the year so you know
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
it was that minutia of that mandate you
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
know we had to revisit it and let alone
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
now we had to change the type of machine
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the 2D to the 3D and and uh we had
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
that legislation that that one insurance
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
company had a little push back on so
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
those these are mandates of mography you
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
know these kind of things the health
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues and there's probably more I'm
 
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:35.079 align:start position:0%
just not really thinking about it at the
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
moment but that is very unusual for the
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislature to step in and say this is
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate care okay and that and so
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
that if we know that people these these
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
things such as these test kits and
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
things are available we know these
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
monitors these patch monitors are
 
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.750 align:start position:0%
monitors these patch monitors are
available

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies are saying
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay we're they give any different one
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
all right this legislation will only
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
affect um a very small portion of those
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
insured we won't affect anybody who's
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare we won't affect anybody who is
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we won't affect anybody who has
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
a large
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
employer we're only affecting small
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
employers who already seem incredibly
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know think that health insurance
 
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.950 align:start position:0%
you know think that health insurance
premiums

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
are a huge major punch on their budgets
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
okay on their hiring people they
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
literally make a decision to hire
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
somebody based upon whether they can
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
afford what kind of health insurance
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to give that employee
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
that's small employers so what we want
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
to say is is this the cost and this
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
benefit that you were describing and I
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
certainly hear you I certainly hear that
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know I know myself all right that
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
that the different times a day that I
 
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.270 align:start position:0%
that the different times a day that I
test

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
myself you know um you know and
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly I you know I'm I'm all over
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
the map with my numbers okay there's no
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
consistent numbers and you think oh
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're no you know you I started out was
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
say I'm just going to do the fasting
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
right first thing in the morning okay
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
well you know only once did I ever break
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
a hundred because in most people with
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes you're fasting blood sugar
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
is your best blood sugar of the day and
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm supposed to be under 100 I'm
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be under 100 now I used to
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
be 130 now I am under 130 but then since
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
you mov the number to 100 only once with
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
my fasting have I broken that okay and I
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
have stopped drinking sodas all right I
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
know more ginger ale you know everything
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
is Diet this and diet that and I'm
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
eating 45 Calorie bread slices and I
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
tried the keto and that was not that was
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
not going to work for me but but I have
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
done everything possible and and I and I
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
convinced my doctor that that you know
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
6.4 that you put put me on the metform
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
and so I will be getting my test so I'm
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to hear what my say my A1C
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be come October 1st okay but
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
not withstanding that to mandate
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
this to tell all small employers
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to mandate this for
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetic or pre or just should know
 
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.670 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetic or pre or just should know
these

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that is it is in the scheme of
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
things of I think of all the things that
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
people should be doing in terms
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
healthwise and how we eat and what we do
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know is is is this worth that bird
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a comment I kind of
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
agree about the
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetic but the type one diabetic I
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
mean the type two diabetic that's being
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
treated with some drug other than
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
insulin I I think it's much more
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
and we've seen and heard throughout our
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
life and on committees here what happens
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't pay attention when you are
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
you are diabetic you're type one
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
diabetic if you don't pay attention to
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
that the side effects are kidney
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
problems and everything else so if we
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
limit the bill so the question you were
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
asking and I'm not sure you guys will be
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
answered because we can get the
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
Department to help us out the question
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
you you you have offered up is that the
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
issue is uh that fromone who is is
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
diagnosed is diabetic um they are not
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
able to get this monitor this thing this
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
thing you want uh and and uh we got to
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
figure out how many people are in that
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
position and then whether this we this
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a mandate that we need to pass and I
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
think the insurance department will be
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
able to speak to some of those numbers
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I do just want to say I
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate the distinction and concern
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
between pre-diabetes and type 2
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
diabetes um however if you treat
 
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.829 align:start position:0%
diabetes um however if you treat
pre-diabetes

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
vigorously I used to say to my patients
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
who were puzzled about what's
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes don't I either have it or
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
not have it I'd say if you treat
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes as if you have full-on
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
diabetes you can largely prevent or at
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
least greatly
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
delay getting the blood sugar numbers
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
that are diagnostic of diabetes because
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
when you change lifestyle and reduce
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
your numbers as you're working hard to
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
do your body becomes less insulin
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
resistant it becomes more able to manage
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
blood sugar
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
so I think we have two separate but
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
maybe parallel considerations here
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's value to this monitoring for
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
people with pre-diabetes
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
there's probably greater more essential
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
value to people with type 2 diabetes who
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
don't take insulin but will develop
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
complications of diabetes if they don't
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
capacity with the right resources to
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
manage the blood the diabetes
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
effectively and control their blood
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
sugars okay if I could just make a
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
comment um it's in regard to individuals
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
with type two diabetes that are not on
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
insulin they uh I'm think thinking about
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
the ones specifically that are on what
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
we call a selfon Ura which is a type of
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
pill for diabetes these have been around
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years and um
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
these cause the pancreas to produce a
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
continuous amount of insulin until when
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
we get into our older years they no
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
longer work very well and then people
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
end up um sometimes on insulin not
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
always but sometimes on insulin these
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
self a
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
Urias uh can cause low blood
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
sugar uh and if after many years of
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
having diabetes many individuals both on
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
selfon uas but also on insulin lose the
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
ability to recognize low blood
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
sugar and they are fine one minute
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
cognitively impaired within a relatively
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
short period of time because their blood
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
sugar has dropped so low and there isn't
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
enough sugar getting to the
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
brain and they can get to a point of
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
seizure I got you let me hear
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
one obviously we hoping this patient is
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
under proper Medical Care Y and I have
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
no doubt that a
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
physician can write that prescription to
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
require this monitor that you're looking
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
for so we're not talking about these
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
those people with this legislation
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
because those people are getting covered
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
the doctor all the doctor has to do is
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
write that prescription and the
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company will write it now if
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
you've believe that the insurance
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
company won't write
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
it okay that then we have a problem but
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
in my mind that um given that everybody
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
is different everybody if there's a
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
place where a physician is concerned
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
about what's going on with the patient's
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
Health okay but if you're thinking that
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to give this skill to a
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
patient for them to self diagnose and
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
say boy I got this problem and I need to
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
be dressing it simp simply because I'm
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
following these numbers or not we all
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
know people once they have these things
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
these test kits they're testing or being
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
resourceful and doing it on a timely
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
fashion or regular basis drops off we
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
agree to that in the beginning so I'm
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
all I'm doing right now is trying to
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
rationalize you know where the insurance
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
companies should be covering it and we
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
then cross our fingers and hope aren't
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
we saying that for at least in my mind
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
and and forgive me for not jumping onto
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetic aspect of it but in the
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
type two case yes these things are not
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
usually prescribed or I don't think they
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
have access to the insurance if they are
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
type one guys they got everything yeah
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
we don't this is not we're not worried
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
about those this is type this is type
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
two this is this is just strictly the
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
type two right is we get them the test
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
kits the the appropriate whatever
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're called test kits and everything
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
else and we we mandate that the
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
insurance has to cover it if they are
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with type two diabetes they
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
get it and if the patient doesn't want
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
to do anything with it and I've known
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
people like that that that's their thing
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
we can't help that but we should be able
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
to get him the test kits I that's what
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
we want to find out I I personally
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
believe based upon what I learned that
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes the insurance companies cover it yes
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
so a couple things the situation that
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
Liz described of low blood sugar
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia unawareness that the
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
patient no longer symptomatic they don't
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
get physical cues to tell them they're
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
dropping and you responded that then
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
CGM they would be with prescription
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
however they would have to have some
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
kind of episode that put them at
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
considerable risk in order for it to be
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
known that they were having hypoglycemia
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
on awareness so if that person is
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
driving while they have low blood sugar
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
people with low blood sugar drive like
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
there at DWI you're you're not a capable
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
driver when your blood sugar is
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
profoundly low but if you don't know
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's dropping and it's dropping abruptly
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
you have no warning yeah but how does
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
this if you have a CGM it alarms you
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay point is that this is this is a
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
proactive this is a proactive patient
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
trying to try to head that off right to
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes to head that off and and and your
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
assumption is if we if we just give it
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
to them for free then everyone will do
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
it no the point being is is that no the
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
person doesn't really know that know
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
they're heading that way you know
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
they're if they if they're going to get
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
to their doctor's office every year and
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
they're getting their A1C every year
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
you'll be in the same place that I am is
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
watching it climb climb climb climb okay
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then and then you'll be but in terms
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
of having an incident you know holy moly
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
no this bill doesn't do anything about
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
someone who's having an incident out of
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
the blue well it would because if people
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
were wearing the CGM no but why would
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
they they be wearing it because they a
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
person with diabetes who wants to manage
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
their blood sugar well and in a timely
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
manner and be safe for them and the rest
 
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.670 align:start position:0%
manner and be safe for them and the rest
of

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
community um and I also wanted to note
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
that there's a drop off in frequency of
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
blood sugar monitoring with finger stip
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
test I I heard with continuous glucose
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
monitors the majority of people who use
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
cgms continue to use them indefinitely
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
and benefit from them regularly it
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't drop off in the same way that it
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
does with finger sticks okay great let's
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
let's hear from the insurance okay
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
thanks cuz we're running tight on time
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you sorry to cut you
 
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:39.470 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you sorry to cut you
guys

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Mr chair uh for the
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jason AIS director of
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
Health Economics New Hampshire insurance
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
department and I really really hope that
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
you go from pre-diabetes state to the
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
non-diabetic state that's great so stay
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
on track we're all hoping for the P so
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the department published a report um
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
in response to the request of the board
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh this committee and we're here to
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay yeah I'll let you open up
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay well need to say the report show it
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
mandate if if that's your interpretation
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
what you repeat them numbers so we have
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
it in unfiled yeah so we we try to model
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
this very complicated study that seems
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
simple on the surface but it really is
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
indeed not um to try to identify the the
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
previous eligible population who is who
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
is currently getting um benefits for
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
this service what the marginal cost was
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
so what the the per capita cost for per
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
year for each patient was and then try
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
to interpret the legislative intent of
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is in its current form to try
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
to predict or offer a prediction for
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
this board to look at the expansion of
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
the new eligible population then we went
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
on to try to predict I think answer a
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
question that you just had in the
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
previous testimony you know what
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
proportion of the new eligible
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
population might take up this new
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
benefit oh wow I can get one of these
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
they look great and it's covered with no
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
cost sharing I want one right but
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
presumably not 100% of the population
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
the expanded population would so we just
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
modeled it based on the previous rate of
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
uptake which is approximately
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
26% of of um type 1 diabetics and type
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
two diabetics on
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
insulin so we presume that because of
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Acuity of the diabetes was a main
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
driver for the uptake rate that that
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
would be an assumption that would be
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
reasonably met 26% so we modeled the all
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the statistics that are in the report
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
on that and that's what you see I think
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
the approximate annualized cost was
 
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.789 align:start position:0%
the approximate annualized cost was
about

00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
$1,380 a year for all parts of um the
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
legislation including two visits to um a
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator for import guidance on
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
how to use the device it's noteworthy
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
that I think in the bill it mentioned
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
three visits over an
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
18month period but because the lens of
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
this report was a 12-month period we
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
took 2third of that which was two visits
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that plus the the device and the
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
supplies was approximately had a median
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
cost of about
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
$138 okay a year all right now
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
um what do we know about when it is
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
being covered I mean what what in terms
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
of insurance companies and and what is
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
do we have is it true that
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
some that they all required you have to
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
be an insulin patient to be able to get
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
these so the first bullet point in the
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
executive summary me mentioned an
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
important concept that I think I after
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
hearing the uncertainty from your
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
interpreters I think it's worthy to
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
mention here that in 2022 we did a
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for I think when this was an
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
LSR and we only had the 2022 data in
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
that data we saw that 100% of the
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
population in the claim in the
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
commercial fully insured market and some
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
self-insured um was entirely type 1
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
diabetics but that changed and it
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
migrated in 23 and we saw that there was
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
now a population of type 2 diabetics on
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
insulin that were in that population and
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
that Peak our interest so we started
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
looking at um language and medicure
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
guidance for coverage for this and
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
indeed began to note a parallel
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
migration away from more um in intensive
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
insulin therapy indications to less
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
insulin requirements for coverage so I
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
think it was three for Medicare coverage
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
for ex as an example um a tangental
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
example because this is not com in the
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
commercial space but it was required
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
that three multiple daily injections of
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
insulin were required for Medicare
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
coverage and then as of April in 2024
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
just recently that went to one and
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's where it currently stands now for
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
CMS guidance for Medicare coverage you
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
still have to be on one insulin
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
injection for for benefits okay and that
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
and that's and so uh you're saying for
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare that's also the Medicare
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
requirement for a type two diabetic yes
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
to get this for free you have to have be
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
getting an insulin product right
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
right I think it's also worth mentioning
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
that you know as
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
treatment treatments for diabetes
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
involve the medical guidance and the
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
medical guidelines for coverage are also
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to to evolve so I think that's
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of what we saw in our report as
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
well is when we look from one dat year
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the next we've seen that evolution of
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
how you know coverage is Shifting
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
because of um standards
 
01:00:10.359 --> 01:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
because of um standards
changing

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.710 align:start position:0%
changing
okay

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
um could you be getting one of these
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
under what is
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
it I remember this is kind of the
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
infamous one of the categories that we
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
have on health insurance is it's
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
supplies or it's medical
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
equipment is like hearing aids were
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
originally under that category yeah
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
communicated in a narrative form in the
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
report was we address that that some
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
some devices are are the the benefits
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
are administered through the pharmacy
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
benefit whereas for others through the
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
medical medical benefit under the DME or
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
durable medical equipment durable
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
medical that's it there we go yeah and I
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
mean I think you know that varies not
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
only just with cgms devices but also
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
insulin pump therapies and there are
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
lots of other examples and that
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
nonstandard approach can be problematic
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably for for carriers and providers
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
alike oftentimes is migration from among
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to demand it those
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
benefits be administered for their
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
device via one versus the other Pathway
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
to to achieve optimal reimbursement
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
rates I think is probably one of the
 
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
targets yes car I I have a question If a
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
person is a type 2 diabetic and they're
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
taking one of those alternative
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
medications that means they do need
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
their blood sugar
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
controlled and for some reason I don't
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
know what why you would take uh insulin
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
versus one of these other medications
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
but why is that considered
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
something that it seems as if the
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
coverage says okay you're on this other
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
medication but you don't need to be
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
monitored as much as you would if you
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
were on insulin but you are on
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
medication and you do have a blood sugar
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
problem so why are we
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
not why is that separated out that's a
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
good question it's it's at the heart of
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
this issue I think that diabetes
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
essentially means to siphon it's it
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
means hypoglycemia
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a proxy but really the the highest
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
clinical utility the clinical utility
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
for these devices that got them to
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
breakthrough onto the market was their
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
protective effect against
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia you can see a a proxy of
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
that in the the indication the previous
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
indications for hypoglycemic aware
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
unawareness so it's really protective
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
against that indeed it has the highest
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
clinical utility one which precipitates
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
the coverage for this marginally
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
expensive device the question it you
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
gets your question in in future
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
questions about how protect or how much
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
clinical utility from a quantitative
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint is there for hyperglycemia
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's not worthy that there would be two
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
distinctly different utility curves for
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
both hyp hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what that's the challenging
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
decision for this committee and it's
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's really verging on cryptic because
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people know what you curves
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
look like okay well I'm and I keep
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
telling people I'm not a doctor and
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have to feel like I'm
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
practicing as a doctor sometimes here um
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
so let's do it in my simple terms is
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
that um you you're over 6.5 you're
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
already you're in the diabetic category
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay um does these monitors have an
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
alarm system to suddenly tell you you're
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemic you're you're having an
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
event okay so then then uh we the
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
interest would be how many people who
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
are are are who are are been defined as
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
type two and are not monitoring at
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
all the prevalence of unmonitored type
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
other words and and and know I guess we
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
would I guess we can't tell how many are
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
not monitored but we could certainly see
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
how we you know how much of people who
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
are uh taking advantage
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
the the say this insulin people who take
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
insulin and who are because I I have a
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
sneaking suspicion that even people who
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
are taking
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
insulin they don't you know they they
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
they they are so confident in themselves
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
they know what they're doing I mean I
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
let's say I know a lot of people who
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
have type one and those type ones they
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
they know their bodies you know they
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
really know their bodies but I I can't
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
say a lot about type two because you
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
know it's it's it's late onset so issue
 
01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
know it's it's it's late onset so issue
is

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
um Carri was saying is what if you're
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you're really on really a
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
diabetic shouldn't you be able to get
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
one of these monitors if nothing else
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
that if you were to you know Tap Out and
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
because you're you're all of a sudden
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
your pancreas just you know was really
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
sluggish and really not doing its job so
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
table one we we aim to communicate that
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
in the report about 37% of all Di
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
diabetics take at least one insulin
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
injection daily and approximately 30% of
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetics take at least one daily
 
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetics take at least one daily
insulin

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
insulin
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
injection so weall that it's it's
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
insulin or um the previous testimony
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
Shar that sulan neides and other
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
non-insulin even metformin can cause
 
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
relative hypoglycemia but insulin
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
without question is the most powerful
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
antihypoglycemic agent
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
um but we we put those statistics in
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
there for the context of this report so
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
you could understand who how we Define
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
the eligible population the percentage
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
of the diabetic population taking
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
insulin okay um and so before we do end
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
this and then and and get back again
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
um most of the time when we do health
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
insurance mandates is we put some uh
 
01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:23.789 align:start position:0%
insurance mandates is we put some uh
guard

01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
guard
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
rails and in terms of how do we narrow
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
it and how do we you're doing it so
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
um I guess I and I guess I want to know
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
what the insurance companies are
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
offering to people in terms of what you
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
know what they where what their status
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
is and what they're able to get um do uh
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
if if somebody instead of having right
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
now obviously the legislation is to give
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
it to them for free no deductible no
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
co-pay do nothing and and that's almost
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
an anathema to this committee in this
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
committee we do expect the patient to
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a little skin in the
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
game so is there something other things
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know what we ended up
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
doing with hearing aids but is are other
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
things that are comparable that had the
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
same U health insurance mandate in terms
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
of those kind of uh
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
Governors I'm not sure I think I heard a
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
message I we have one one of the major
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
Med carriers here so I don't want to
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
speak for them but in as a preliminary
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
measure in creative this report we query
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
the five major Med carriers to ask them
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
to share and they they willingly share
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
their guidance and I believe all of them
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
required some form of insulin therapy
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
for coverage for this and all diabetic
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
po I got over that threshold okay okay y
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
so and then when they require that is
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
there a co-pay or deductible even if
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
they are on on insulin is it is it free
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
like this like this bill so in actually
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have Anem okay yeah in the
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
report we included c a table with CAU
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
sharing yeah and and hum me just send
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
the report out to all of us again cuz
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
did you have the report I do remember
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
getting it yes so and I remember
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
scanning it but I can't say that I read
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
it closely all of the claims for 2023 we
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
saw Zero do of cost sharing there there
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
were a yeah median cost sharing was was
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
really really low so the cost sharing
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
buring as it currently stands is is very
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
very low okay that's in a table in the
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
report all right great okay thank you
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
you have any more questions for him or
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
Sabrina I'm still a bit hung up
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
on what I was mentioning before if
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
somebody is
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
a diagnosed type 2
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
diabetic which means that eventually I I
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
assume and I I don't know the
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
progression of how this works if they
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't take care of it they're going to
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
be a full-on diabetic and if they don't
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
take care of that they're going to end
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
up really really with
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
problems why I I don't understand the uh
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
the the calculation that goes into
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
saying well you are in in fact diabetic
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to help you with the
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring the way we would with just
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
one injection of diabetes even though
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
you are on
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
drugs I that's a good question and that
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
may not be a question for you well I'm
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that I would
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
characterize it that way because it's
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
important to note that and I'm a fan of
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
Representative Damon's legislation and
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitoring I have one
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
my daughter has one there's High utility
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
to it it's important to note that that's
 
01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:45.799 align:start position:0%
not blood glucose monitoring and it may
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be true that they don't
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
have ability to
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
monitor their glucose they could they do
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
have robust benefits for blood glucose
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring which is a much more
 
01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
monitoring which is a much more
directive

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
directive
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
pathway continuous glucose monitoring
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
sensors don't measure blood glucose they
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
meant to interstial fluid glucose
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
concentrations that's a proxy for blood
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
glucose that's important because it's
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
not known that intertial high intertial
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
glucose concentrations cause any of the
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
disease States associated with diabetes
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
like blindness kidney disease and lower
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
leg amputations rather
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia which means high sugar in
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
the blood or high glucose in the blood
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
causes that so A more directive way
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
allbe it inconvenient painful and
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes dirty of a way is to use blood
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
glucose testing this is a more that's
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
right which is cross-sectional right now
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
what's my blood sugar it didn't tell you
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
what your blood sugar was in AR no it's
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
moment at the moment at the moment or
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
what it is going to be in an hour but
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitoring sensor is
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
a great Innovation I tried to describe
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
that in the report how that became
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
innovated but it wasn't until strong
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
improvements in the correlation between
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
fluid glucose concentrations and blood
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
glucose concentrations became acceptable
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
for that to get FDA approved and once
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
that happened all right it's a great
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
proxy albe it a little bit more less
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
cost effective than finger sticks but
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
presumably more comfortable Accord
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
According to some right more more up to
 
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
be get to test it that's right and I I
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
lwed um representative Damon's um point
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
that she made about compliance and the
 
01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
that she made about compliance and the
drop

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
drop
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
off you know the current state of
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge about cgms is is is
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
constrained and some some might say
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
plagued by publication bias that
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
epidemiological data is really lacking
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
right now on on the the benefit and
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
reduced relative risk for long-term
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
complications associated with diabetes
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
from CGS monitoring versus blood glucose
 
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
but that's coming soon and so that's not
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
a trivial a trivial Concept in this
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
debate but type two diabetics have the
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to test with their blood
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
sugar which we I would call that a close
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
substitute or maybe cgms inversely might
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
be a close substitute to blood glucose
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring it's a fabulous
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation great thank you thank you all
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
right you you have another question no
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right great all right
 
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.830 align:start position:0%
okay all right great all right
Sabrina

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure I just wanted to respond to
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
Carrie's um remarks about type two
 
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
diabetes so type two diabetes is real
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes it's not any less concerning
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
than type one but it's treated often
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
differently it's treatable because in
 
01:12:53.229 --> 01:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
type typ one's not
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
treatable well it's treatable but in
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
type one your body doesn't produce any
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
insulin anymore so you have to take
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
insulin right in type two your body
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't respond well to the insulin that
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
you make and eventually there's a
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
deficiency of
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
insulin but it's treatable in ways
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
besides taking insulin at least for a
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
while does that help at all it does
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
help but it to me that and
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh to me that still means you got to
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
monitor the devil out of this thing
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
continuously to make it work right for
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
yourself I think one of the biggest
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
mistakes from a public health point of
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
view in the diabetes world is thinking
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
that type two diabetes is less severe
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
than type one and not taking it
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
seriously I think that's I think you're
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
right I think that is part of the
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
word I don't have my folder from last
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
year with I've had to dig deep through
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
my emails to refresh my memory on
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
testifying on this uh last winter so I
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
just I want to just level set a little
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
bit because I think conceptually of
 
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
course we all want people with diabetes
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's type one type two or
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes to be able to manage it I
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
have people near and dear to me in my
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
life who have diabetes we care about
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
this issue I think the problem is about
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill it is so Broad
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
and the scope of it opens the door for
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
anyone to get these devices and the
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
price is capped at $30 and so I was just
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
pulling up an email with our medical
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
director Dr lur who's been doing this a
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
long time and he said the legislation is
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
way too General um and it dictates this
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
sort of cap and availability for anyone
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
without clear guidance on it and the
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
jury is out on type 2 diabetes I think
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that in some cases
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
this would be appropriate in other cases
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's not and so I recall other carriers
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
testifying to this too that we
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
constantly update our clinical guidance
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and Dr lefur noted that specialty
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
Societies in this space do not recommend
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
the use of these devices in all patients
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
with type two diabetes and this bill
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
would just open the door to that and so
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's our biggest problem with
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
it is that the language of the bill is
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
incredibly broad um and so I think you
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
know I just wanted to bring us back to
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the sort of like actual language of the
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill and what it would do can can uh
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and and yourself
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
get together and see what where those
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
broad uh holes are that maybe we can
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
close up a little yeah and in my sense
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
is I'm not aware of there being like
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
some broad problem and this also in
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
terms of coverage this also brings us
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
back to the question of coverage and
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
benefit design issues versus no cost
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
share versus capping something at $30 in
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
statute we also get to the fully insured
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
versus self-insured issue so State
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
mandates only appli to the small fully
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
insured market mean not just small group
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
but the fully insured people in the
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
state which is getting smaller every
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
year and you know self-insured plans are
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
not subject to State mandates and so you
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
know if there's like a real problem in
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
this space I think we need further
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
discussion I think the way this bill is
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
drafted is so broad that that it just
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
opens the door wide open in a way that
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily even address an
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
underlying issue if there is an issue
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
again because of the small sliver of the
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
market it would even apply
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
to well I I it sounds like if those two
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
folks got together we might get
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
something that was uh more Compact and
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
more direct is that
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
possible um yeah
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm always happy to have
 
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.669 align:start position:0%
well I'm always happy to have
conversations

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
Anthem is always willing are and I
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
haven't heard complaints I'm sure you
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
know Peter and Harvard and and all all
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
would love to have the discussions so
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
but um I would have to say from what I'm
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
hear from representative Damon that any
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
any narrowing is defeats the purpose in
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
her mind and that is you've got to make
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
this available and and and and hope for
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
the best well and and so and and and
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I was trying to convince you
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
say that that's not when it comes to
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
health insurance mandates you know we
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
have this uh mandate that we're not you
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
know we're trying not to harm Insurance
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
Market you know with uh with with
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
something that could be very very
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
expensive or could not have any effect
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and only a handful of people take
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of it um you never know what
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
what happen it seems that getting
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
something much narrower
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
through is better than getting nothing
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
at all right so if we can come up with
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
something that's direct and uh make
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
sense in the market that we have that we
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
can do without destroying our insurance
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
Market I think we got to go for it right
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
and so I I think in the end we can say
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
we we recommend further legislation but
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
only if the parties can agree on the
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
scope of what we're not recommending
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
this bill in its current form but that
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
if future legislation was addressed
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
these issues and you know the narrowing
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of what is it where where is it
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we really could have this benefit
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
and have an a long-term benefit um
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
economically for what it's going to cost
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
to implement it yeah I I think that sums
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay then maybe we don't need another
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
then I
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
think from where we are in the time
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
scale of things November would be the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
next time that you would be able to come
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
up with another piece of legis
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
but I think sticking Us in the middle of
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
it without you talking to like Anthem or
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
whoever is appropriate to talk to Anthem
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
is good because they're big I really no
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
I don't it's you two guys that have to
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
come up with a meeting not I don't want
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
to we shouldn't be in the middle of
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
this that's okay all right okay so maybe
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
we won't we don't need have another
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
discussion I
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
think uh you will see it in
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
January when it's been introduced but
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
you might get it early because she might
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor okay all right we all said
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.639 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%

02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
this he stepped out he'll be back
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um oh okay I guess we have to wait for
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%

we're here today um to talk about s sp64
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
um originally we were just going to talk
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
about manufactured housing but I believe
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we're expanding the conversation to
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
also talk about condo board
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
resolution um so Susan did you want to
 
02:09:35.239 --> 02:09:42.709 align:start position:0%
resolution um so Susan did you want to
say

02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:59.709 --> 02:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
Christmas so anyway um so we're here I
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
guess we'll start with the manufactured
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
housing and we obviously want to hear
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
what you all have to say and we've had
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussions um I know I've had
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%

and I know that there are serious
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
problems we we are not sure that it's a
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislative fix we we're not sure about
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
that but we want to explore it and we
 
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
want to if there's something that we can
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%

hearing where we say where we're from

it over to some of the folks that came
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
we have representatives from um both
 
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities and investor
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
owned Parks who have a um a lot to say
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
about the bill and so is that okay if I
 
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
just yeah I was actually I was thinking
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that before we do that I think I was
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
wondering Karen Susie does it make more
 
02:11:44.189 --> 02:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
sense for you to talk from your
 
02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:45.559 align:start position:0%
perspective or do you want to hear from
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
the other folks first
 
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
to okay all right then um um that that
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be fine actually um representative
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
Aly do you want to speak to um your
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
concerns or should we start with the
 
02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:01.559 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing since most of the
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.629 --> 02:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
that okay so who wants to who wants to
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
come up and speak first who's who wants
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
has something to say about manufactured
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
housing I guess I have to take take
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
notes my name is Patty Co I live in
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
Great Brook Village which is an investor
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
owned property in Belmont New Hampshire
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are a total of 65 houses there I'm
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
here specifically to ask the committee
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to add in investor owned
 
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
communities to the bill and also ask
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
that the board of manufactured housing
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
be brought back under the umbrella of
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
the office of Professional Licensing and
 
02:12:55.629 --> 02:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
certification I understand that that
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
board was disbanded last year you'd
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
never know it because all the
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
information is still on the State
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
website it's all there so we sent a
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
complaint specifically about our park
 
02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:14.559 align:start position:0%
rules and because that was what we were
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
told who would address it because the
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
property manager through the owner was
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
not taking care of our property so we
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
need a mechanism to be able to go to for
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
dispute over park rules rent increases
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
subject we've dealt with that also we're
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
still dealing with it to the point where
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
we now have an attorney and we're taking
 
02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.390 align:start position:0%
we now have an attorney and we're taking
him

02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
through haven't got to court yet but
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be there soon if nothing works out
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
but my goal here today is to ask you to
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
please include all manufactured home
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%

okay that's right that's right and I am
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
living in ston Brook Park in seabook New
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inv own Park and I'm also the
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
treasurer on the board of
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Moda and um I also am the person who
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
gets the email from people and this
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturing home ownership is new for
 
02:15:12.549 --> 02:15:12.559 align:start position:0%
me I bought a home two years ago so the
 
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
whole concept is fairly new to me um but
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm understanding is that since we
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
lost the
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
board there is no place for people there
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
just is no place and the income uh level
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
of manufacturing homeowners parks areow
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
on the lower income I live in a 55 plus
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are 55 plus and so people
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to hire attorneys right
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
our association is having a situation
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
and the association hired an attorney
 
02:15:53.229 --> 02:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
last year to deal with the Park owner um
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if we have some
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
resolution but we only have so much
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
funds that we can spend on an attorney
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
so I would also like to ask you to
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
please include investor owned parks and
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the um Gmail on the Gmail account for
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
moda in only the past two weeks I have
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
six complaints that I think are very
 
02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.430 align:start position:0%
six complaints that I think are very
serious

02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
serious
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
four of uh five of them are uh co-ops
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
and one two no excuse me two F four of
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
them are co-ops two of them are investor
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
owned and one of those investor owned
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
complaints um is going to be to resolve
 
02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
since the owner is taking no
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's going to be
 
02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive for them to fix the
 
02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
property which they don't even
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
own but the owner of the property is
 
02:16:54.030 --> 02:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
telling them their driveway is their
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility and there's a defect
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
under the ground and um so they don't
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
have any money to hire an attorney and
 
02:17:05.309 --> 02:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
she's got a handicapped child who is in
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
a wheelchair who can't get on the school
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
bus because she can't get down the
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
driveway so there are these issues where
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
we have a uh a document that we provide
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
for people that at Moda that's guide to
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
resolving disput
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
and we have two um recommendations that
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
are government agencies the office of
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
professional licenser and certification
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
and then the New Hampshire consumer
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
protection hotline at the Department of
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
Justice every single one of those people
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
have tried to make contact and have been
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
turned away we don't help you you know
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice will only get
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
involved if it has to do with you
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
getting evicted so there is just no
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
place for all these people to go and
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
with limited
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
income so thank you very much for I
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
just um you you mentioned Moda a couple
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
of times what does Moda stand for maybe
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
I missed that motor is um manufacturing
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners and tenant association we're
 
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
non-for-profit and Mota became sort of
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
defunct um many before covid
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
and uh the president I guess and like I
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
said I'm I'm only new to this so I don't
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
know a lot but um he died so and then Co
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
covid came and so things kind of went
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
down and it and so now we're rebuilding
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
it so we're still in the rebuilding
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
phase of trying to get members and get
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%

02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
all these new rules so he's revised all
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
his rules and in in in that it says that
 
02:19:51.870 --> 02:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
we are responsible for keeping up the
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
driveway and the the walkways
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
which we read that meant you know we
 
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
need to shovel it and you know maintain
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
it now he is very clear my my landlord
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
is very clear that he owns the property
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
he owns the trees and you know nothing
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
is going to happen without his approval
 
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
we've got many driveways that are
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
falling apart he in my mind
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
he knows they're his responsibility but
 
02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
they're not bad enough he's not fixing
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
them and we've got elderly people you
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
know disabled people and there's cracks
 
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't deem it need in need of
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
fixing and so they're not getting fixed
 
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
we have trees in the past year alone
 
02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
we've had three trees fall on
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
homes he we have we're a park one of the
 
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
reasons I moved there was because of all
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
these trees it's a wonderful marvelous
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
Park but he doesn't make maintain the
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
care of the trees so he won't take
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
anything down that looks alive but um
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
he's not maintaining the trees so
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're hundred years old or more
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're beginning to die off you have
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
the there's branches just falling off
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
the trees I'm going to be going back and
 
02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
battling because there's a branch that
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
is so dead and it's huge over my house
 
02:21:16.349 --> 02:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
that woodpeckers are going crazy with
 
02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
and all I want is for him to come and
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
cut that Branch off to protect my home
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
and he just doesn't seem too
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
interested can can hold on a second
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative do you have bylaws in
 
02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
your yes we and have you read them the
 
02:21:34.750 --> 02:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
association has bylaws okay he doesn't
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh Moda has bylaws yes but your Park our
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
he he does not have bylaws our
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
association we have the Stony Brook um
 
02:21:45.790 --> 02:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
Association it's called salt and oh my
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
gosh I can't think of what salt stands
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
for land tenants Association but um so
 
02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
it within the the park we devised a an
 
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
association in preparation if he has you
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
know we want to be prepared if he ever
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
wants to if this park sells he's I think
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
he's in his maybe early
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
90s and promises that the house is going
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
to stay in the family but we've started
 
02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
an association so we can be prepared to
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
possibly turn to a co-op okay um so we
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
have bylaws okay all he has is
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
rules there is no
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
lease um assignment just a followup you
 
02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:28.110 align:start position:0%
lease um assignment just a followup you
mentioned

02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
that that's good you mentioned that
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
trees fell on some of the H do do you
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
know how that was resolved I mean if if
 
02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
my neighbor's tree falls on my house I'm
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
going to sue him right no it's an act of
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
God and so you whatever you get out of
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
your insurance company is what you get
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
so as I was on that board until I had
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
resigned last election so I could be on
 
02:22:57.309 --> 02:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
the board of Moda and you know I I
 
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
looked into what how much can you go to
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
small claims court and it's up to
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
$110,000 I I know that one of the people
 
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
had the tree fall it was in the middle
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
of like a typhoon she called Mr Brown he
 
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
didn't even come and he said it was a
 
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
Friday it's like raining like you can't
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
even believe and he said I'll I'll I'll
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
have somebody out there by by
 
02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
Monday now a tree's on her house the
 
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
rain is pouring into her home and he's
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
not going to have some a tree guy till
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
Monday so she had the tree removed and
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
another tree that they deemed was dead
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it was $3,000 just to remove those
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
trees that's and he said you didn't have
 
02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
my permission to remove the trees so do
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
you have a lease no we do not have a
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
lease we have park
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
rules park rules set by the owner owner
 
02:23:53.269 --> 02:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
yes no lease just you're supposed to
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
sign now I refuse to sign the lease
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
because when we hired the attorney the
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
association hired the attorney to
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues in the the
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
new rules for instance the trees I mean
 
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's several other things but and we
 
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
had a special meeting and he came with
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
his son and I caught him in an outright
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
lie but um nothing was resolved
 
02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
and so I told them I'm not going to sign
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
your rules until you resolve my concerns
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
so you were asked to sign a lease and
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
you didn't I did not sign a lease there
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
is no lease there are park rules that's
 
02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
very different than a lease so I didn't
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
sign the rules and not there are no
 
02:24:43.269 --> 02:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
repercussions I mean overall I'm very
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied with him I think we're he's an
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
a I think he cares a lot about his
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
property and the people why this tree
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
issue is I'm not really sure and the
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
other issues that we have just business
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
right right he's a businessman you know
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
so um but you're putting people's lives
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
now in danger as far as I'm concerned so
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
problem yeah so um I've been doing this
 
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
a long time and uh I'll never forget
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
this this is going to be almost 30 years
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
ago and the issue that you brought up
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
about how the AG doesn't want to get
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
involved unless someone has been thrown
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
out well you the AG would get
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
involved if you had a
 
02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
lease because they would be treating you
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
like a renter and we have very extensive
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
statutes on renters
 
02:25:40.279 --> 02:25:42.190 align:start position:0%
statutes on renters
rights

02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
and much to my surprise when we were
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
going through this type issue the state
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
of Connecticut mandate
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
that you have to have a lease MH and
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
resolution for your situation which is a
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
you know privately owned Park that if
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
you had a lease then you'll know how
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
much the increases in the rent will be
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
you'll know you'll have everything know
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
and if and then in there will clearly
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
State how they're going to deal with
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
driveways or
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
trees yeah no but we can't make him I
 
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know if he perceives this
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
the new rules to be a lease in my mind I
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
mean I've been a homeowner and owned
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
income property I think there's a big
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
difference between some rules and a
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
lease oh there is so he we are not
 
02:26:39.150 --> 02:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
signing a lease we are acknowledging his
 
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:40.830 align:start position:0%
signing a lease we are acknowledging his
rules

02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
and some of the rules that that I
 
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
engaged in disagree with is he wasn't
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
so and he said his lawyer put this whole
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
thing together and I said funny I was
 
02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
thing together and I said funny I was
told

02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
told
 
02:27:01.710 --> 02:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
by I think somebody a Community Loan
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
Fund that this is basically does anybody
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
remember that that the what what he had
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
is is written up by the Community Loan
 
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
Fund like like I I don't know remember
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
rules but he basically copied and pasted
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
someone else's document um and a lot of
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
it so
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
um he's he's backed off shortly after I
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
noticed I did notice a lot more of his
 
02:27:30.269 --> 02:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
tree guys around town you know around
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
town taking some trees down but the
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
association put together what we call
 
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
our tree form and it's kind of a map and
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know to submit it and we are just
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get people to put everything
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
in writing and have your documents so if
 
02:27:50.429 --> 02:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
the only thing is really open to you is
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
to take them to small claims court well
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
at least you can do that but if you if
 
02:27:57.389 --> 02:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
you're just complaining yeah and calling
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
them and complaining without a paper
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
trail we don't have any way to um really
 
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves so I'm working on that
 
02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.790 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves so I'm working on that
end

02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
there oh
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
sorry hi hi uh
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have some questions about
 
02:28:16.479 --> 02:28:17.630 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have some questions about
your

02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know one the kind of going backwards
 
02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:23.710 align:start position:0%
you know one the kind of going backwards
in

02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
it you said you're something about the
 
02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
rent increases it's my understanding
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
wrongly but rent increases are severely
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
restricted in manufactured housing Parks
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring up rent increases oh okay
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
I think they're I think they're
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
restricted to $15 a month per year
 
02:28:45.469 --> 02:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
unless you can justify an increase right
 
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to be have you'd have to
 
02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
show us documentation taxes
 
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
or something went up right so you're not
 
02:28:54.429 --> 02:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
you're not you effectively have rent
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
control on mobile home
 
02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:58.990 align:start position:0%
control on mobile home
parks

02:28:58.990 --> 02:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
parks
 
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.670 align:start position:0%
parks
uh

02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
the I'm not sure what it and in New
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no requirement that
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
leasees be in
 
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
writing so if a landlord says to you
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
with a normal rental interval which is
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
30 days I presume in your
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
facility uh they give you 30 days notice
 
02:29:24.269 --> 02:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
that as of 30 days from now you have to
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
mow the lawn as an example they have the
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
ability to do
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
that um so I'm not
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
sure the rightness or wrongness of it
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the economics of it are outside the
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
scope in my opinion of what the
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
legislature should be involved
 
02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
in I'm my concern here is
 
02:29:54.750 --> 02:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
that uh I think you have remedies to
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure what remedies you feel
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have you have the same
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
remedies that any other tenant has you
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
can go to landlord tenant court you are
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
a tenant in fact mobile home parks have
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
a even greater constraint on them than a
 
02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
a even greater constraint on them than a
regular

02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
regular
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
landlord uh you have there's greater
 
02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
constraints than just under
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
540 uh a which is the mostly the
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant code so what I'm I mean
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
I hear things that are probably
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate problems you're concerned
 
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
about a tree falling through your roof
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
or he doesn't maintain the driveway and
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
I would perhaps he should or perhaps he
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and maybe he maintains your
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
driveway but not her driveway I those
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
are all individual issues but I'm not
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not understanding what remedy
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
you were looking for from the Le I mean
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
I get what it is but I'm not sure why
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
this should this group should or this
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
group of citizens should have a greater
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
protection than they already have since
 
02:31:06.670 --> 02:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
they have more protections than uh a
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
regular tenant in an apartment building
 
02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
or a single family
 
02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
house in fact your your landlord can't
 
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
even sell his Park until it's gone
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
before for the Community Loan Fund and
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
they've and and the tenants do or do not
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to buy it so he's he doesn't have
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
freedom of sale so I'm not I'm not
 
02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:30.990 align:start position:0%
freedom of sale so I'm not I'm not
really

02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure what more you
 
02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
want what what you know now he's mean
 
02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:38.030 align:start position:0%
want what what you know now he's mean
and

02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
he's that's what I'm hearing here I
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
think you have all those protections so
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
okay that's my concern I think there's a
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
different set of concerns which will
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
come up later with homeowners
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
associations on Condominiums and things
 
02:31:54.030 --> 02:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
and that would then also apply if you
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
purchased the park if it was a co-op
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
then there would be Association rules
 
02:31:59.710 --> 02:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
there but again all these things are
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
provided for in normal landlord tenant
 
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
law they're also provided for in
 
02:32:07.269 --> 02:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
association documents if you purchased
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
it so I'm not sure why we need
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
a i the the the mobile home uh committee
 
02:32:20.349 --> 02:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
whatever that commission right was
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
they they did away with it because it
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
had so so such little
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
activity well I will speak to that yeah
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
because it was our Moda was defunct for
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit and so a lot of things were
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
coming through Moda people didn't even
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
know it existed and then covid happened
 
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
and everything sort of shut down so you
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
know that's part of it the question I
 
02:32:45.269 --> 02:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
have you make a good point I I've never
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
heard of the landlord tenant you know
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
system certainly um I have not heard of
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
it um in Moda but you know where would
 
02:32:59.469 --> 02:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
that fall for us that there is a a park
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
is being sold and it the property is
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm just making up numbers but I have
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
a neighbor who's a realtor who just
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
brought this to my attention as as an
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
occasion who this is happening I don't
 
02:33:16.990 --> 02:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
know what park it it just got sold but
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
the the value of the property was
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
something like $1 million sure
 
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
and a um Investment Company came in and
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
paid 24 million so the people who were
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
trying to make it a co-op can't compete
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
with that and they are you're you're
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
giving we're closing the door of any
 
02:33:41.359 --> 02:33:42.550 align:start position:0%
giving we're closing the door of any
lower

02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
income possibilities for people to be
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners and it's under the way it is
 
02:33:49.950 --> 02:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
right now is you're comparing to to what
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
it cost to rent and if we don't have
 
02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
that nobody's going to be a homeowner in
 
02:33:59.309 --> 02:33:59.319 align:start position:0%
the economic um category of lower income
 
02:34:02.910 --> 02:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
people and how can we compete well now
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
now you've taken now you now you're on
 
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
another subject but I'm but wouldn't
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
that be a part of the mediation board
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
that's no that's not what this is about
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
and and the proof is in the
 
02:34:17.469 --> 02:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
pudding if you talk to your friend
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
behind you from the Community Loan Fund
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
they do these things all the time I can
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
tell you that in chesher County the
 
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the mobile home facilities
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
are now uh owner
 
02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:34.429 align:start position:0%
are now uh owner
occupants

02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
occupants
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
so and by the same token you said you've
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
owned a house and you've owned
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
investment property I imagine you sold
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
some or I imagine you sold that for a
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
profit at some point one of them I did
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay good
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't a landlord on that one okay
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
but you your house you sold it a profit
 
02:34:57.389 --> 02:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
so the question you just asked is the
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
same question is if we turned that
 
02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
around and said if you had sold it for a
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
lower amount of money then you could
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
have broadened the pool of people who
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
had who could have bought it and
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it have been nice if somebody
 
02:35:13.309 --> 02:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
with less money had been able to buy it
 
02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's not how a market economy works I
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
understand so if you take the the net
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
rents on whatever they are on your your
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
facility that was up for sale that you
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
referenced and divide it by 8.5 that's
 
02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
your sales price that's a 8 8 and a
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
half% return on investment that's a
 
02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:33.950 align:start position:0%
half% return on investment that's a
conservative

02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
number uh
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
know there's nothing in this bill first
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
of all would that I as I understand
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
would get involved with the sale of
 
02:35:48.670 --> 02:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
properties and if it did I would object
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
to it even more streng uously so we're
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
really at what point at what point do
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
you want to move out of a market economy
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
I mean if you want to move out of a
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
market economy and have things allocated
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
and controlled by the state then you're
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
headed in the right direction if you
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
want to live in a market economy then
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is not none of this is what you
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
want there are Bad actors there are Bad
 
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
actors in
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
everything there are good actors and
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
everything probably neither of them get
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
enough credit
 
02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
but uh you make a very good point and I
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying so
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's you know those are those would be
 
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
my concerns with us okay thank you can
 
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
you tell me again what is what is the
 
02:36:34.110 --> 02:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant 54a 54a yeah it's a book
 
02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
good if you buy it as a book it's that
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
thick and that is landlord tenant that's
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law law it's under the
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh Attorney General's office and um
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
there is a free mediation service yep
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay so so you haven't tried that no I
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard of that again I'm new
 
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire two years and things I
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't know but um I thank you I thank
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
you for even listening to me thank you
 
02:36:57.920 --> 02:36:59.710 align:start position:0%
you for even listening to me thank you
very

02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
much I actually have a question for the
 
02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
chair but do do you have to don't roll
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
your eyes at
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
me do you know um you mentioned
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I thought was interesting
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're mandating a lease y do they
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
also have some specif I can't ever say
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
this word specifity in terms of what
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the leas or is it is it
 
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
broader do you I have to admit this was
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
a long time ago so I have no idea okay
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
what the but that that the end of the
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
result was that most people do not have
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
leases and those are those can provide
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
protection and so over the years when
 
02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with this legislation you
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
know we did have the you know price con
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
have some board that was approve rent
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
increases and that's when we learned
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
that you know said why would you have
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
this in your lease when you buy the you
 
02:37:50.349 --> 02:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
know when you rent you you know you're
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
it is true you're buying your unit but
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
you're in the end of the day you're
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
renting the space and so what you know
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
what what controls do you have over that
 
02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
the landlord and that and generally
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
historically the landlords have always
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
been uh
 
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess you would say that they were
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
U gentle with their raises and gentle
 
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
with it and then you know when it got
 
02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
really bad then obviously we had the
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
stepped in because the and everybody
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
said well the answer is that you need to
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
own your own Park that that's the right
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
answer but as we now know about the
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
other bill is that owning own Park you
 
02:38:33.429 --> 02:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
know you know comes with a consequence
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
of of uh some elst group of people who
 
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
run run the park and and and ignore the
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
rules and do whatever they they want to
 
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
please and and uh so there unfortunately
 
02:38:48.429 --> 02:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of Perfect Solutions
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
here well it seem I mean it seems to me
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
that that might be an Avenue to pursue
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
about the leases and very frankly that's
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to be dependent the chances of it
 
02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
going through on which political party
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
wins in November and I won't say which
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
is which yeah so I would say this is
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
issue could last a lot longer than our
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
political cycle and it's always been the
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
assumption that eventually all these um
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
owner parks are slowly phasing out and I
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
mean I know Jensen's at one point in
 
02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
time had you know like a dozen but I
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how many they have left now
 
02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
but so slowly but surely there that the
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the those parks are slowly moving on to
 
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
thanks to the Community Loan Fund so
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
whether that's the right answer or not I
 
02:39:38.429 --> 02:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
don't know it's it's it's always it's
 
02:39:41.230 --> 02:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
always been a problem can
 
02:39:45.550 --> 02:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
I uh two things in in terms of things
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
that have to be in a lease under New
 
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law a lease is subject to New
 
02:39:52.349 --> 02:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's statute of fraud so it has
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
some basic things it has to contain be
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
included right be included but other
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
than that it's whatever you and no it's
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
fair game with the rest of rest of the
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
stuff that's in there but if you don't
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
have lease well then you have a you have
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
well I I'll I'll never forget it it was
 
02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
all it was uniformly from Moda I'm
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
trying to remember the lady who used to
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
run she used to be Lois yes and uh she
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
was here she was camped out this in the
 
02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the committee all the time and um but
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
they she made it clear that they were
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
not interested in leases because they
 
02:40:26.670 --> 02:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
always thought the the problem with the
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
lease was then it's going to be written
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
right into it how much the rent
 
02:40:31.870 --> 02:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
increases are going to be and how much
 
02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know that and that and that that
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
some landlords would go a year or two
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe not have any increases so to
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
them at least was was a bad idea that
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
they would they'd like to they like the
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
fluidity of you know let's see how we're
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
doing and how the park is doing and how
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know and that the landlord was just
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
going to be you know pass on those
 
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
expenses that that needed to be passed
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
on and uh so it you know it ironically
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be Hermon you know that
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't that bad but obviously
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
when it got to it you know got ugly and
 
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
when we had you know property tax
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
started to go through the roof that's
 
02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's when you know we Rec created the
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the landra you know to get to give them
 
02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
a way to afford to be competitive to to
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
be able to afford to buy the park back
 
02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
and for themselves but not withstanding
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
if somebody eyes that property to make a
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
lot of money you know you know turn it
 
02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
into something that they thought they
 
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
could make a lot more money on it yeah
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
you're not going to compete with that
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
and and now you've thrown you know x
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
amount of people out on the
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
street representa uh just maybe you can
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
give a little more clarification on a
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
540A now do I understand there is a a
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
complaint board or no no where did that
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
come actually we had a bill this year
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with the landlord tenant yeah
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's called landlord tenant court but
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's easy to it's it's easy to go
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
into uh it's it is designed to be where
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
is this though this is not under 548 do
 
02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
you remember the discussion this year
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
where we had about uh trying to get a
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
tenant out of a house that refuses to
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
leave remember having that floor debate
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
I don't remember that no okay well five
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
4A is everything that's landlord tenant
 
02:42:24.670 --> 02:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
related in New
 
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of which apply to mobile
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
home parks right and then they have
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
another set of statutes that are on top
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
of that that are specific to mobile home
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
parks they're but so just within the
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
parameters of
 
02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
540A the
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
tenant has the opportunity to petition
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant court to
 
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
rectify whatever they're issue the
 
02:42:50.590 --> 02:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
landlord has got a free he's endangering
 
02:42:53.550 --> 02:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
my life that's a bad thing so they can
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
go in and for $60 go into district court
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
and say Here's my case this is why they
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
have to make some kind of case out of it
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
but well is is that the answer that
 
02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking for I mean if these people
 
02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
well then maybe it's as I'm saying it's
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
sitting right before us POS possibly I'm
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm baffled that they don't go to
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
landlord tenac court it cost 60 bucks
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
has anyone who's
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's heard of it okay so you haven't
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
utilized maybe that's the problem well
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure your landlord hasn't told you
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
about it but I'm sure they know about
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
it I mean for for 60 bucks um we don't
 
02:43:33.469 --> 02:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
have to reinvent the wheel no the cord
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
will type up the the service for it does
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
here pull the Y
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
oh I mean it's not like one liner it's
 
02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.110 align:start position:0%
oh I mean it's not like one liner it's
like

02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
is is there any arbitration it's
 
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
mediation yeah it can't be it's
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
mediation yeah well that's thing
 
02:43:58.469 --> 02:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
arbitration okay the judge will say you
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
go out in the call and talk about
 
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
this okay let's let this gentleman speak
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
name did you turn your
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
there you go sorry I think my
 
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is an example of of uh of
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
democracy and a and a resident own
 
02:44:31.830 --> 02:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
Community uh it's it's uh it's it's a
 
02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
pleasure to live there now I am a member
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
of motor I'm uh also been the president
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
of my own cooperative for 10
 
02:44:43.630 --> 02:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
years uh and I served uh on the
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund board of directors I
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
served on the Rock USA board of
 
02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
directors I served on Rock associ ation
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
which is resid own communities Across
 
02:44:57.630 --> 02:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
America and uh I've I dealt with a lot
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
of issues that surround democracy and Co
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
and cooperatives and and how to help and
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
support them a great piece of news I
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
heard today was that uh because I deal
 
02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
with with investor owned communities as
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
well is this this uh RSA
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
540 uh which I don't think anyone was
 
02:45:18.750 --> 02:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
that aware of so thank you for that uh I
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
go away have Having learned something
 
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
today uh the only issue I have is is
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is that RSA
 
02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
205a which is basically for manufactured
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
housing uh to have a uh an oversight uh
 
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee or an oversight organization
 
02:45:41.070 --> 02:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
such as the manufactured housing board
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh is an important piece but I think
 
02:45:45.630 --> 02:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
it's an important piece for it's there's
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
an RSA and there needs to be an
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement wing for it and uh and it's
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's and the
 
02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's and the
RSA

02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:45:57.389 --> 02:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
covers resident owned communities and
 
02:45:59.630 --> 02:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
investor owned communities and I think
 
02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be a little bit
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
discriminatory to to only do one only to
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
to uh uh have enforcement for one part
 
02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
of that organization I think there are
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
needs on both sides of that there I am
 
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
certainly in favor of it because I think
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
there are there is Need for uh conflict
 
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
resolution in communities and but it it
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference whether it's
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured or a resident-owned
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
community or an investor owned Community
 
02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
we all have our issues and and uh would'
 
02:46:31.950 --> 02:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
like to see some
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
organization that would that motor
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
could could uh give information to
 
02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
people so that they would have some some
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
form of resolution to conflict that
 
02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:43.830 align:start position:0%
form of resolution to conflict that
they're

02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
facing uh you know in this day and age
 
02:46:51.630 --> 02:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
is affordable housing is is is depleting
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
the largest stock of unsubsidized
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is manufactured homes
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
resident owned
 
02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:00.910 align:start position:0%
resident owned
communities

02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh are are notorious for keeping rents
 
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
low because they don't have any
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
investment uh uh I should say return on
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
investment uh need and uh I can tell you
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
that my community went a period of 10
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
years and and had only1 $10 increase in
 
02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
their rent we have a lot of folks there
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
that live on Social Security and they
 
02:47:23.389 --> 02:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
can afford to live there
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm hearing stories of invest
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
investor owns investors buying
 
02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
communities today because they are they
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
are a top dollar they're paying top
 
02:47:38.190 --> 02:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
dollar and in order to substantiate that
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
they have to raise the rents beyond what
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
people can afford I'm hearing stories
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
today of folks that have to move out of
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
their homes in New Hampshire because
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
they can't afford a $1,200 lot fee when
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
it was 500 3 years ago that's a travesty
 
02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be dealt with and
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps this RSA 540 can help out with
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
that but in any case my point is that I
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that you've got an RSA that
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have really any teeth to it
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
because there's no enforcement for it
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
and it's I think it's discriminatory not
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
to it's it's it's designed to protect
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
all manufactured homeowners whether they
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
live a resident own or not and uh I
 
02:48:24.030 --> 02:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
think you'd be dis discriminated against
 
02:48:27.309 --> 02:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
one group if you didn't in include them
 
02:48:27.319 --> 02:48:28.110 align:start position:0%
one group if you didn't in include them
thank

02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much I actually I'm
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to direct this to representative
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
Faxton you know I think one you know we
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
oh Jesus what the heck is that that's my
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
phone I thought it was a pager I got
 
02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
scared um I blow up on you yeah I know
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
um you know representative Mair talked
 
02:48:47.269 --> 02:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
about mediation versus arbitration the
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
difference is mediation
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
tries to bring the parties together
 
02:48:53.429 --> 02:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
arbitration a decision is is brought
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
down so even if they go to landlord
 
02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:58.309 align:start position:0%
down so even if they go to landlord
tenant

02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
02:49:00.429 --> 02:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
court well landlord tenant Court's
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
binding on both parties how is that I'm
 
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
just I'm trying to understand if it's
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
mediation how is it binding well it's
 
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
not it's not mediation if you go to
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant court the judge gives
 
02:49:11.790 --> 02:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
the judge is going to give you the
 
02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity typically to go out and work
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
it out in the hall okay okay and then if
 
02:49:19.389 --> 02:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
you can't come up to an agreement then
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay Dad's going to make a decision
 
02:49:22.990 --> 02:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's so it is Bing that's correct okay
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
involve any any of I I well no I I would
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to read it no cond are not Brant if
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
you read the definition right there you
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
can read it out to
 
02:49:43.950 --> 02:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
everybody who is a
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
tenant tenant means a person to whom a
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
landlord rents or leases residential
 
02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
premises including manufactured housing
 
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
or a space in a man manufactured housing
 
02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
or a space in a man manufactured housing
Park

02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
Park
 
02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you very much and just
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
just so we're clear on 548 it it's a
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Statute there it's not
 
02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
like that was one little s that's one
 
02:50:11.469 --> 02:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
little sentence there's 200 Pages well
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
no there's not well there related which
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
your reading is all the case law all the
 
02:50:17.309 --> 02:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
case law comes back to it yeah which
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.349 --> 02:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
speak iita durett again you know to
 
02:50:34.429 --> 02:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
speaking to that you know I have read
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
205a and I'm an educated college
 
02:50:40.349 --> 02:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
educated person and it's
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
almost unable to comprehend so I'm going
 
02:50:44.469 --> 02:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
540 there are people in these places
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
that aren't going to be able to read
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
this stuff and comprehend what it their
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
rights are or what it means and they're
 
02:50:59.469 --> 02:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
going to be going to to the
 
02:51:02.229 --> 02:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
court by themselves most likely because
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be able to afford an
 
02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
attorney and you're going to have the
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
landlord there with their attorney
 
02:51:11.150 --> 02:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
and the difference again between
 
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
arbitration and mediation least you go
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
into mediation and we have landlords
 
02:51:19.150 --> 02:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
coming in and they're not even following
 
02:51:23.070 --> 02:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
their own lease and so as far as rents
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
are going and I just think it's not fair
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
to the common man to expect them to look
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
at 540 you know whatever it is and 2058
 
02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
to to be able to comprehend exactly
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
because you don't write it in English
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're writing it in some kind of a
 
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
legalistic you know writing that unless
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
you go to law school it's very hard to
 
02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
comprehend and mo our motor meetings we
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
set aside a part of our agenda for them
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
to go through that
 
02:51:59.229 --> 02:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
205a with us to be able to explain it
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
the guy down the street in their house
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
does not have that benefit can can I can
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
I interject that that sounds like it's a
 
02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
good project for Moda to try to dumb I
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
mean I I I don't mean this in a
 
02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
disparaging way because myself as a
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislator sometimes struggles with some
 
02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the legal ease um to dummy it down so
 
02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
that everybody it's real easy read
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
simplify it okay I shouldn't have used
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
the word dumb D because that's I think
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
of dumbing it down for me no I meant for
 
02:52:30.070 --> 02:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
me dumming I understand and if we had
 
02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
such a document that would be awesome
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
well uh I I agree with both of those
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
things uh I many years ago I worked for
 
02:52:41.710 --> 02:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
an insurance company and they decided
 
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
that they were going to simplify the
 
02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
English and their policies
 
02:52:48.510 --> 02:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
which no one knew what they meant then
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
so mhm
 
02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:53.070 align:start position:0%
so mhm
uh

02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
the there's legal aid
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
available and I would well many of your
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
points are well taken you know the you
 
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
know the guy who doesn't have your
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
educational background looks at this and
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
says what does this all mean but that's
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
the but that's the situation for the the
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
single mother who's a high school
 
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
dropout that's renting and has a Section
 
02:53:17.389 --> 02:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
8 she doesn't know what her rights are
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
or may or may not not so there are all
 
02:53:23.630 --> 02:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is you're missing a whole big
 
02:53:28.269 --> 02:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
section of rules that are open to to you
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
and if I would suggest that since you're
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
very involved in this if you go online
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
to Lexus Nexus buy their book on New
 
02:53:39.750 --> 02:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landlord tenant law it's it
 
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
will cost you 75 bucks but get the
 
02:53:44.229 --> 02:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
association to pay for it y thank you
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you but it's not just single
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
mothers who are on Section dat we've got
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
I I I completely agree with you on that
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just using there there are inherent
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
inequities in our system everybody can't
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
win or correct so the so the design of
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
the system is to provide provide
 
02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
guardrails and make it so that it's
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
everybody has the same
 
02:54:10.349 --> 02:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity I mean I I used to like the
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
bowl when I was a young man and you know
 
02:54:14.229 --> 02:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
bowling with the bumpers out like you do
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
with your kids I mean that's really not
 
02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
fun right but you win better it's easier
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
to win right that is the point yeah or
 
02:54:24.190 --> 02:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
you lose or you lose right if you're not
 
02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
as equipped as the landlords are you got
 
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
to you got apples to oranges it's it's
 
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's a con it is a constant challenge
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
but there in this room from my
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
perspective our issue is do we need
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation which is
 
02:54:47.469 --> 02:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
potentially redundant or is it is it the
 
02:54:49.229 --> 02:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
matter is the matter that you have
 
02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities that you don't know about
 
02:54:55.150 --> 02:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
and aren't using or do we do is there
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
something missing and my point would be
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's not that we're it's not so much
 
02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
that we're missing something as that
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's opportunities that you're not
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
aware of correct and that would be on
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
the end of in landlord tenant owned but
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
now you've got a law sole set of laws
 
02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 205 with zero representation for
 
02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:17.309 align:start position:0%
RSA 205 with zero representation for
rock

02:55:17.309 --> 02:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
rock
 
02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners that doesn't make
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
sense that you would have laws that are
 
02:55:26.910 --> 02:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.269 --> 02:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
to would you just go over that one more
 
02:55:32.309 --> 02:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
time you're saying you have rocks are
 
02:55:34.830 --> 02:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
the homeowners the co-ops yes so you've
 
02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
got RSA 205a that are the state laws
 
02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
governing manufactured
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
homes without a governing board or board
 
02:55:48.630 --> 02:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
that oversees those laws
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
the laws are really
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
mute well the they're not laws at all
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
unless you got a lot of money to hire a
 
02:55:59.229 --> 02:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer to go you know go up against so
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative are you saying that it
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
applies to those folks as well you
 
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
always you can you can go into District
 
02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
Court I mean again it's if it's a land
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
dispute it has to go into Superior Court
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
but this isn't a land dispute this is
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
still you know I I guess I'd have to
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer to sort this out
 
02:56:21.229 --> 02:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
what it is but again I would think the
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
association would have some kind of
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
counsel but what happens when the
 
02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner has to go up against their own
 
02:56:31.710 --> 02:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
board that you got boards that are rogue
 
02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
I mean there it's it's not an easy
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
answer I I had a thought on that
 
02:56:38.469 --> 02:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
previously which is you know how first
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
of all how many of these boards are
 
02:56:45.670 --> 02:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
rogue I know I 5% of them 1% I mean and
 
02:56:49.469 --> 02:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
which isn't to justify a bad actor who
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
but if you're if they're if they're
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
violating their
 
02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:54.429 align:start position:0%
violating their
own

02:56:54.429 --> 02:56:54.439 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:56:57.870 --> 02:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
agreement that's a contract and so
 
02:57:00.429 --> 02:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
you've got you you certainly have the
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
Civil option but at some point if it
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
truly breaks that breaks that contract
 
02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
you also have the you should take it to
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:13.150 --> 02:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
attorney County attorney yeah cuz every
 
02:57:15.870 --> 02:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
place we've gone to that we've known
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
about to lead people to wants anything
 
02:57:20.550 --> 02:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
to do with them well I believe that
 
02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
to do with them well I believe that
County

02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
County
 
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
attorney how how many and I'm going to
 
02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
put your name attached that you
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
suggested these
 
02:57:32.190 --> 02:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
things how how many how many members of
 
02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
are there of
 
02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
Moda right now I think there's 39 so we
 
02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
are building from the ground up 39
 
02:57:44.510 --> 02:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
people or 39 uh uh let me say
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
30 36 people and four
 
02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:51.920 align:start position:0%

02:57:55.550 --> 02:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
just pay your D pay your $25 dues or um
 
02:57:58.110 --> 02:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
the parks pay 75 and we have
 
02:58:00.030 --> 02:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
institutions that would try an
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
Institutional um membership uh for
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%

02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
need lawyers we can't even get lawyers
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
to to represent us they don't want
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this issue we have
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone that has been spent a week
 
02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:18.830 align:start position:0%
someone that has been spent a week

aid I believe I'm not sure if I remember
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%

02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
interested if you were being evicted if
 
02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:41.720 align:start position:0%

come up who may have some some more
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:59.550 --> 02:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
issue well there were a couple of things
 
02:59:03.469 --> 02:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
that came up um one of them is that the
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board was repealed
 
02:59:11.309 --> 02:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
a few years ago on the woman that was in
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
charge of the office of professional
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
licens and
 
02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
certification left to become a judge
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
last week I believe it was and there is
 
02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
a new uh sheriff in town there and she
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
um would she was thinking she'd like to
 
02:59:35.550 --> 02:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
renew that but then she thought or they
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
told her that you are now just
 
02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
professional lure and certification so
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
it can't be here on next year I'm going
 
02:59:49.229 --> 02:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
to be putting in a bill you're going to
 
02:59:51.710 --> 02:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
hear a little bit about maybe uh
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
afterwards but you've heard a lot about
 
02:59:57.870 --> 02:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
it already and and I had found a new
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
home for the condominium dispute board
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
which on is the uh Department of
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
administrative services and Charlie
 
03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
Arling house said that he would do that
 
03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
at the time so um I've got to go back
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
and talk with him
 
03:00:21.630 --> 03:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
about the manufactured housing board
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
because really it did work itself out of
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
a job but then we got two new things
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
happening one of them is that the cost
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
of any housing in this state has gone
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
beyond our worst nightmares or biggest
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
dreams depending on where you are in the
 
03:00:47.110 --> 03:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
income scale uh and the second is that
 
03:00:51.309 --> 03:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
um people from Mostly from out of state
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
came in and start all over the country
 
03:00:57.070 --> 03:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
and started they started in the west
 
03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
buying up manufactured housing parks and
 
03:01:05.070 --> 03:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of the people that lived
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
in them by raising the rent so high they
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it and then turning them
 
03:01:11.309 --> 03:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
into whatever they wanted for that
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
particular piece of land and yes that is
 
03:01:17.389 --> 03:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
part of capitalism but capitalism from
 
03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
the beginning has always been considered
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be necessary to to put guard rails on
 
03:01:27.630 --> 03:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
it so that um
 
03:01:31.630 --> 03:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
people people from all levels of society
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
would be able
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
to uh survive and to
 
03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
provide manual labor and to provide uh
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
for the elderly that fell after working
 
03:01:49.150 --> 03:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
as a middle class person during the most
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
of their lives um
 
03:01:54.590 --> 03:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
into to
 
03:01:57.229 --> 03:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
poverty and
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
um at least the volumes I've read um but
 
03:02:05.550 --> 03:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that um I wanted to
 
03:02:09.670 --> 03:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
bring up was that I have also never
 
03:02:14.269 --> 03:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
heard of this um I I heard a little bit
 
03:02:16.510 --> 03:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of mediation in
 
03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant
 
03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh at the time I was looking at this I
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
also heard that uh the landlord got to
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
decide which court it would be be done
 
03:02:32.229 --> 03:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
in that's not correct that's not correct
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
no the court okay court system is based
 
03:02:38.349 --> 03:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
on the town that the property is in
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
Period end ah and I was told it was the
 
03:02:43.790 --> 03:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
town that the owner was in no it's it's
 
03:02:46.150 --> 03:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
where the property is located okay
 
03:02:48.030 --> 03:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's not well that's good
 
03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's of course but the other problem
 
03:02:52.110 --> 03:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
is our court
 
03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
systems and our AG's office and our
 
03:02:55.279 --> 03:02:56.229 align:start position:0%
systems and our AG's office and our
County

03:02:56.229 --> 03:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:02:58.710 --> 03:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys and
 
03:03:02.349 --> 03:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
um and certainly the
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
um the legal aid people are all
 
03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:09.550 align:start position:0%
um the legal aid people are all
underpaid

03:03:09.550 --> 03:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
underpaid
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
under resourced they don't have enough
 
03:03:15.269 --> 03:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
people to do all of the work that
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
they've got already and that's why
 
03:03:18.349 --> 03:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
existing um adding extra stuff on
 
03:03:25.950 --> 03:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
there and especially when
 
03:03:28.269 --> 03:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
it's not related to what they've been
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
specializing in which is apartment
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
buildings they they have their whole
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's if you go into district court in
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
any County in New
 
03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's got a special window for
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant
 
03:03:46.830 --> 03:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
court they're already set up for this
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's like they knew you were coming and
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
they baked the cake okay so well I think
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
everybody should go and look at that I'm
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to go I've got to go up to Grafton
 
03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
County in a little while anyway um I'll
 
03:04:03.150 --> 03:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be looking at that when I was 20
 
03:04:05.550 --> 03:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
years ago working on a different project
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
and spent a fair amount of time there I
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
never saw that window maybe it's new
 
03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:10.550 align:start position:0%
never saw that window maybe it's new
well

03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
I but maybe they just maybe they just
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
put have it in chesher County but I
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
doubt that yeah um
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
but it does the other question with that
 
03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
is how long is it going to be before
 
03:04:29.150 --> 03:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
they can schedule that
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
hearing because the problem we have in
 
03:04:36.670 --> 03:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
condominium problems is that the person
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
who or people who are
 
03:04:43.550 --> 03:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
complaining tend to get
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
persecuted during that time until
 
03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
decision is made
 
03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's fairly violent
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
persecution but well that's a that
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like a police issue but the the
 
03:04:57.150 --> 03:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
dockets and courts vary from season to
 
03:04:58.750 --> 03:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
season and year to year in court to
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
court but again only speaking from
 
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
personal experience in chesher County
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're generally on the docket within
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
two to three
 
03:05:08.429 --> 03:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
weeks that's very good I guess the
 
03:05:10.750 --> 03:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
people in nashwa should move there
 
03:05:10.760 --> 03:05:11.950 align:start position:0%
people in nashwa should move there
please

03:05:11.950 --> 03:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
not representa can I ask you quen you
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you're going to put
 
03:05:19.229 --> 03:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
forth this bill for cond dispute board
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
um are you planning to include the
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing in that or not uh
 
03:05:26.429 --> 03:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to talk with some
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
people about this it's just an idea that
 
03:05:32.229 --> 03:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
came up but manufactured housing has one
 
03:05:35.309 --> 03:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
Corpus of Law and Condominiums have
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
another but it may be possible to put a
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
bunch of this stuff
 
03:05:45.870 --> 03:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
together uh in separate sections with
 
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
the existing housing
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
court I think that would be uh an
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
interesting Avenue to pursue absolutely
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question for the
 
03:05:57.389 --> 03:05:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative you you referenced
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
earlier people coming in from afar and
 
03:06:03.229 --> 03:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
buying up uh mobile home parks and
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
driving up rents Etc and I want to go
 
03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
back to the earlier testimony which we
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
all seem to agree on is the limit on
 
03:06:14.910 --> 03:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
rent increases is $15 a month period the
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
end a year not $15 in May and another 15
 
03:06:21.469 --> 03:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
in June it's an annual rent increase of
 
03:06:26.670 --> 03:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
$15 a month unless the a greater uh some
 
03:06:29.469 --> 03:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
new and interesting cost can be
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
established that's in privately owned or
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
investor owned Parks so for $180 a year
 
03:06:38.110 --> 03:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand that if you don't
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
have a dollar it might as well be a
 
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars but $180 a year doesn't
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
seem like an excessive
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
increase uh now I know that in
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
in my area where many of the Parks have
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
been sold to the owners or the tenants
 
03:06:54.600 --> 03:06:55.309 align:start position:0%
been sold to the owners or the tenants
the

03:06:55.309 --> 03:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
owner tenant owned Parks whatever
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
they're called but owner resident
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
resident own oh resident owned Parks so
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
and and I know many of them were shocked
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the cost because where the former
 
03:07:12.910 --> 03:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
owner was charging $500 a month now the
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
actual operating costs are $800 a month
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh with management fees and paying back
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
the loan and whatever so that's the only
 
03:07:24.030 --> 03:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
place in my area that I'm aware of where
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen huge increases in the monthly
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
fee to the association but I don't know
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
how how how an owner could legally raise
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.429 --> 03:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
month I find that
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
completely um impossible to explain why
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
why would an
 
03:07:53.229 --> 03:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
owner uh a investor invest in a property
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
and pay $113 million for it or something
 
03:08:02.190 --> 03:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
like that because it's near a lake um
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
and not expect to be able
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
to to raise the rents a lot more than
 
03:08:13.469 --> 03:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
what you're saying well I how are they $
 
03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
that was the testimony in this room
 
03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
earlier today I mean it's that's the law
 
03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it may be the law in New
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it may also be not
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforced well it would if if that was
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
the case if if you if you lived in a
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
park and the law New Hampshire says I
 
03:08:33.630 --> 03:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
can't charge you more than $15 a month
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
and I justify it and I raise it $300 a
 
03:08:39.429 --> 03:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
month you have zero chance of surviving
 
03:08:42.229 --> 03:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
in court that's clearly the County
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney but you could go in there
 
03:08:47.469 --> 03:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
prosay and that is that just can't stand
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
stand they couldn't throw you out for
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
not paying
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
it they can't well it's like you can't
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't you can't if if if
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody writes I remember a
 
03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
policeman in my town once somebody came
 
03:09:03.630 --> 03:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
and filed a bad check claim because that
 
03:09:05.790 --> 03:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
he had they had written a check for
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing marijuana and because you
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
can't you can't make that claim if you
 
03:09:13.229 --> 03:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
took a check for
 
03:09:15.229 --> 03:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana if you're breaking the law
 
03:09:17.710 --> 03:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
you're breaking the law so you can't go
 
03:09:19.630 --> 03:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
to court and say I like this part of it
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
but not that part well this this is very
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
interesting I will um be looking at that
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
in my own area um we
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
have one
 
03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:36.150 align:start position:0%
have one
rock

03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
rock
 
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
and about a mile down from it there is a
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
a resident a um tenant investor tenant
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
in which is not what I would think of as
 
03:09:54.030 --> 03:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
an investor it belongs to a 93y old man
 
03:09:58.030 --> 03:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
who uh they think is a pretty good owner
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when he
 
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
dies on it will be up for grabs and
 
03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:07.110 align:start position:0%
dies on it will be up for grabs and
right

03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
now these these places are
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
across the road a busy road but across
 
03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
the road
 
03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
from Moma
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
Lake uh and the first rock in there
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
managed to Miracle to make it to make it
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
work um
 
03:10:36.190 --> 03:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
but but that was six years ago eight
 
03:10:41.150 --> 03:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
years ago um and now now the cost of the
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
land itself is
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
probably up around those 10
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
10 10 million
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um just because of the place
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
03:10:58.590 --> 03:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
in so
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah you've raised a lot of of issues
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
that I want to go check on in another
 
03:11:08.110 --> 03:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
County because Cheshire is one of the
 
03:11:10.269 --> 03:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's part of New Hampshire it's part of
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we're part of New
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even though people think that
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're part of
 
03:11:19.469 --> 03:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to pursue that and we'll
 
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
follow that and see see if there needs
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be a separate bill um on that but
 
03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for for testifying
 
03:11:32.110 --> 03:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
today oh and I did I did want to also
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
say to agree that we really if you're
 
03:11:39.710 --> 03:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to have an oversight board for
 
03:11:44.190 --> 03:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
rocks which are already
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
overed by by the Community Loan fund we
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly need one for the uh the
 
03:11:55.389 --> 03:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise owned if which would include
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
the one owned by my my friend down the
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
road from the rock that is 93 years old
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
and may die at any

03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.710 --> 03:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
she's not in a private par she's in a
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
community own yeah she's in a
 
03:13:02.349 --> 03:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
rock so if I can interject yes please
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on here okay um
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
Karen Susi represent the New Hampshire
 
03:13:10.830 --> 03:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association okay
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers installers private park
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
owners okay um we have a lot going on in
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion first of all I would
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
like to hello Anita you and I would love
 
03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
to chat I'm delighted that Moda is back
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's wonderful that the
 
03:13:30.110 --> 03:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
residents are now speaking up for
 
03:13:32.910 --> 03:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
themselves rather than the lender I
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
think it's wonderful I had a great
 
03:13:37.150 --> 03:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
working relationship with Lois Paris who
 
03:13:39.790 --> 03:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
led moda in the past years before she
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
passed so I welcome that
 
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity very important for residents
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
to have an open dialogue with Park owner
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm hopeful that if you get back to
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 64 and you want to talk
 
03:13:58.389 --> 03:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
about the resident-owned communities
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps Moda might be able to come up
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
with a dispute resolution
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
program you know I would hope that
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
residents if there are issues in
 
03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities that the
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
residents would want to resolve
 
03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:12.830 align:start position:0%
residents would want to resolve
them

03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:14:15.630 --> 03:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh you want to talk about now did
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
we go on to the board of manufactured
 
03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
housing um that was actually repealed
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
last year not years ago it was repealed
 
03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
last year uh that was because um I think
 
03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
2019 was the last time they had any
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
complaints and most of the complaints
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
that they received weren't within the
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the board to be able to
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
handle so didn't have a lot of action
 
03:14:43.110 --> 03:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
going on first of all the New Hampshire
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association had
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that being reped
 
03:14:50.030 --> 03:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
appealed we did not suggest it it came
 
03:14:52.269 --> 03:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
down from the top and down just like
 
03:14:53.950 --> 03:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's getting rid of boards and
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's making them
 
03:14:59.550 --> 03:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
advisory okay so go for it who
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically uh dissolve board the
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
governor this legislature did you voted
 
03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
to repeal it yeah I think it was on
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
consent I can't quite remember the
 
03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
consent I can't quite remember the
consent

03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
calendar um what else can I say I think
 
03:15:18.190 --> 03:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of B actors in The out
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
there in every industry in every aspect
 
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um but again if Moda would be
 
03:15:27.469 --> 03:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
comfortable reaching out to me if
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're hearing about an issue in a
 
03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
privately owned Park well then by all
 
03:15:34.990 --> 03:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
means reach out that's what Lois did not
 
03:15:37.229 --> 03:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
a not a big deal I've got a business
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
card um any is there anything else I can
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
answer for you want to talk about rent
 
03:15:45.229 --> 03:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
increases yeah what okay let's go rent
 
03:15:45.239 --> 03:15:48.150 align:start position:0%
increases yeah what okay let's go rent
increases

03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
um so I think it was in
 
03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
2019 that someone came forward it may
 
03:15:57.269 --> 03:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
have been represented D David luno uh
 
03:15:59.469 --> 03:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
proposing h a rent control bill for
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks for privately
 
03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:05.070 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks for privately
out

03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
and rather than do that we offered as
 
03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:09.710 align:start position:0%
and rather than do that we offered as
the

03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
association to have our mcap program put
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
into statute okay and that reads that if
 
03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:18.990 align:start position:0%
into statute okay and that reads that if
the

03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:24.030 --> 03:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
rent increase is more than $15 a month
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
proposed right
 
03:16:30.269 --> 03:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
so if it goes over 15 the residents can
 
03:16:32.830 --> 03:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
petition and get
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
51% signatures from the park and move
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
forward with um a uh
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
mediation and I'm trying to think what
 
03:16:47.189 --> 03:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
else but oh something to keep in mind
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
though that
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
$15 which is still in statute today that
 
03:16:55.389 --> 03:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:59.550 --> 03:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
2005 so that's which that's a pretty low
 
03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
2005 so that's which that's a pretty low
threshold

03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:02.750 align:start position:0%
threshold
15

03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so but the one that we
 
03:17:07.790 --> 03:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
repealed what that what RSA was that
 
03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
that was also in 205a I believe the
 
03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
board of manufactured housing yeah so
 
03:17:17.469 --> 03:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
who would who would mediate that
 
03:17:20.349 --> 03:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
so we have a mediator that the
 
03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
association pays
 
03:17:25.389 --> 03:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
for as long as
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry folks uh the New Hampshire
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing Association I'm
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
happy to meet up with you after this
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay very good um could could not a
 
03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
mediator be a a first choice for these
 
03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
people to go
 
03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
to and I mean okay are you now you I'm
 
03:17:50.030 --> 03:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay now we're kind of yeah what what
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
are you focusing on well we we've got
 
03:17:56.110 --> 03:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
folks that are in these uh associations
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
whether they're privately owned or or
 
03:18:00.990 --> 03:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
investor owned and they have complaints
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
and they they don't have the money to go
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
to a lawyer why not have some sort of a
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
mediation board and now you're telling
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
me that there is one for some issues why
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
can't it be extended for other
 
03:18:19.189 --> 03:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
issues okay so the mcap program the the
 
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
lot rent increase um for private Parks
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that we pushed forward
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
did to on our own that we pay for the
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
mediation okay as unless there's a park
 
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
who's not our member of our part of our
 
03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
association then that Park owner pays
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
for the mediation so that's something
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
that we put forth now if Moda wants to
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
put something forward that says hey we
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
want to come up with a med
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
Ator wonderful it's you know residents
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to take hold and move
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
forward with that I don't think that
 
03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
private perks should have anything to do
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
with any type of oversight of Resident
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
owned communities this is something that
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the residents should have control over
 
03:19:06.269 --> 03:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
not the lender not not privates but the
 
03:19:09.189 --> 03:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
residents should have an answer have
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
something to help themselves move
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
forward the only reason I'm here is
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I kept getting the calls from
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
the residents and Resident owned
 
03:19:18.189 --> 03:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
communities that's my only reason for
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
being here I I have a question for you
 
03:19:22.910 --> 03:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
when you talked about your mediation um
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
for the private Parks is there any teeth
 
03:19:27.309 --> 03:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
in that I mean if you have an owner who
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
says I'm not going along with
 
03:19:32.670 --> 03:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
that okay so no there it's not M so
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
mediation is non-binding right it's not
 
03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
arbitration okay so if for some reason
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
the residents don't like the outcome
 
03:19:42.269 --> 03:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
they can go to court
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
vice

03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.750 --> 03:19:54.760 align:start position:0%

03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
sir yeah good afternoon my name is David
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
DWI from Belmont I live in a park called
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
Great Brook
 
03:21:15.150 --> 03:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
Village uh I'd hear I'd like to address
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
a few of the issues that have been
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
brought up here uh this one that we were
 
03:21:20.910 --> 03:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
just talking about was
 
03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
mediation we had a rent increase
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
imposed last year we disputed that rent
 
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
increase it's a uh investor owned Park I
 
03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:32.950 align:start position:0%
increase it's a uh investor owned Park I
should

03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
say so we filed the necessary paperwork
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
to go to mediation which was offered as
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
a as a way to resolve this
 
03:21:40.439 --> 03:21:42.070 align:start position:0%
a as a way to resolve this
dispute

03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
we got the necessary signatures from the
 
03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
homeowners we arranged the mediation
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
as it turns
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
out mediation was not successful we did
 
03:21:54.910 --> 03:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.070 --> 03:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
agreement I and one of the other
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners represented the homeowners in
 
03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:00.990 align:start position:0%
homeowners represented the homeowners in
the

03:22:00.990 --> 03:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:03.550 --> 03:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
park the management company was there
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
representing their side the owner the
 
03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
state as it turns out the only thing
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the management company had had to
 
03:22:20.110 --> 03:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
do was not agree to
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
anything so as far as mediation goes it
 
03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a waste of time frankly
 
03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:27.990 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a waste of time frankly
the

03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
mediator I'm sorry I can't remember your
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
name right now the mediator brought the
 
03:22:33.790 --> 03:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings to a
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
halt and she finally said we're not
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
getting any answers here I'm going to
 
03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
bring this to a
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
halt the management company
 
03:22:45.550 --> 03:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
stonewald did not answer questions again
 
03:22:47.309 --> 03:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
and again and
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
again the management company would not
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
mediator when he did say
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
something it was a series of
 
03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:02.110 align:start position:0%
something it was a series of
unintelligible

03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
unintelligible
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
phrases that made no
 
03:23:08.349 --> 03:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
sense and he would ask after saying this
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
does that make sense in the mediator
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
looked right Adam said no please answer
 
03:23:12.399 --> 03:23:13.429 align:start position:0%
looked right Adam said no please answer
the

03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
question this was not once or twice this
 
03:23:17.950 --> 03:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
went on on and on through the whole
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
almost three hours of this
 
03:23:23.070 --> 03:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
mediation so we followed the program we
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
went to mediation mediation was of no
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
use that disputed rent
 
03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
increase is still in dispute today we
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
made it very clear after the
 
03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
mediation that we're going to pursue it
 
03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
further it was not
 
03:23:43.870 --> 03:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
resolved and after listen to the frankly
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
gibberish that we got during the
 
03:23:48.510 --> 03:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.189 --> 03:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
session my
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
only my analogy I'll get off the track a
 
03:23:55.630 --> 03:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
bit bit here my analogy
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
is if you remember a comedian called
 
03:24:01.189 --> 03:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
Professor Irwin Corey who talked in
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
unintelligible phrases and he made it a
 
03:24:05.950 --> 03:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
a funny presentation that's what this
 
03:24:10.150 --> 03:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
guy did for for the whole uh session of
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
the mediation so mediation was not
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
successful after the mediation was
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
completed I called
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
mcap said we did not come to an
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
agreement what is our next step what can
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
we do next and the reply was we could
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer very
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
expensive but that's the only option
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
that we had was to hire a
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer we are presently involved in
 
03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
another rent
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
dispute we got a rent
 
03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
increase effect of January of this year
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
some rents increased 22% someone else's
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
was 16% someone else was was 19%
 
03:24:53.439 --> 03:24:56.670 align:start position:0%
was 16% someone else was was 19%
year-over-year

03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.870 --> 03:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
I happen to have in my rental
 
03:25:03.070 --> 03:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
agreement a clause that limits the rent
 
03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
increase to a certain formula tied to
 
03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
CPI CPI plus 2% to be
 
03:25:10.990 --> 03:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
exact the management company does not
 
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
follow that they do whatever they want
 
03:25:17.189 --> 03:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
to do legal or illegal
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
the rent increase effective January was
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
much more than that allowable
 
03:25:25.550 --> 03:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
amount many people uh had a much much
 
03:25:28.269 --> 03:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
bigger rent increase than I did there is
 
03:25:28.279 --> 03:25:29.229 align:start position:0%
bigger rent increase than I did there is
no

03:25:29.229 --> 03:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:25:32.189 --> 03:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
consistency to the rent
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
increase there is no consistency to the
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
new rent that a new tenant would
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
pay so there are a couple issues
 
03:25:42.790 --> 03:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
involved one is the amount of a rent
 
03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
increase that is allowed and thank you
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
very much for the information about
 
03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:50.830 align:start position:0%
very much for the information about
RSA

03:25:50.830 --> 03:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
540 but the rent increase is one issue
 
03:25:58.510 --> 03:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
abusive practices of some of these
 
03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:03.550 align:start position:0%
abusive practices of some of these
investor

03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
investor
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
owners that are raising the rent for new
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.030 --> 03:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
want for a park like ours the current
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
rent is approximately 5 to $600 a
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
month depending where you are depending
 
03:26:21.309 --> 03:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
park our rent is now for new owners for
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
new people moving in our rent is now
 
03:26:31.870 --> 03:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
$1,200 a month 11 $1,195 a
 
03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
month so they're heaping these new
 
03:26:39.309 --> 03:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
extremely high rents on new buyers new
 
03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
tenants new
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
residents in addition to that the latest
 
03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
tactic being used is they're making the
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
rent agreement a month-to-month rental
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
agreement so for the lot
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
rent they're offering the new residents
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month rental agreement to
 
03:27:00.910 --> 03:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
rent the lot that their house sits
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
on this is this is
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
unconscionable how can people pay a
 
03:27:09.870 --> 03:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
month-to-month rent without being
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
assured that they're even going to have
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
a a place to
 
03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.590 align:start position:0%
a a place to
live

03:27:14.590 --> 03:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:27:18.429 --> 03:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
so they're essenti making the houses
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
worthless sales have stopped virtually
 
03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
$1,200 a month
 
03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
rent potential buyers are just hanging
 
03:27:29.790 --> 03:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
up the phone and in walking
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
away a month-to-month rental
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
agreement this is making impossible to
 
03:27:38.469 --> 03:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
so that uh the rent increase is one
 
03:27:44.070 --> 03:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
issue but the abusive practices driving
 
03:27:47.229 --> 03:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
the rent so high that people can't sell
 
03:27:49.710 --> 03:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
their place is putting a financial
 
03:27:52.269 --> 03:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
burden on someone who may there may be
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
people who are depending on the value of
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
their house maybe for their retirement
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
be uh so I lend my support to this bill
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
establishing the committee not only for
 
03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
resident-owned but also for investor
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
owned parks and if that's a method to
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
help people resolve these disputes to
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that the landlords in the
 
03:28:20.269 --> 03:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
management companies abide by the law if
 
03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's a way to get information out to
 
03:28:24.670 --> 03:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
people and help them resolve these
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
disputes then that's why I favor this
 
03:28:32.469 --> 03:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh quick question sure the the rent
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
that you pay is that for the home or the
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
land or both it's it's a lot rent just
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
the lot rent I own the home okay I own a
 
03:28:44.950 --> 03:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
home the rent is for the lot rent thank
 
03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:47.349 align:start position:0%
home the rent is for the lot rent thank

03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that was helpful that
 
03:28:51.790 --> 03:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
information anybody else would like to
 
03:29:02.429 --> 03:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
sir we blending it or we want
 
03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
to finish this one up and then start up
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
the other okay so we're so we're going
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
to finish up the if nobody else has
 
03:29:15.389 --> 03:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
anything to say about this um sorry I'm
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
not talking into the mic um I think that
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
what our committee needs to do is is
 
03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
reconvene you know there have been you
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
know a lot of good suggestions about um
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know um solutions that may be
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
available that people don't know about
 
03:29:30.750 --> 03:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
but I think uh our committee needs to
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
also explore possibilities of of any
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that might be possible it
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
may not but I think we need to take a
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
look at it so um I think then we'll end
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
this part of the hearing and we'll move
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
on to the condos
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%

Grafton 17 we got redistricted and I'm
 
03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:02.429 align:start position:0%
Grafton 17 we got redistricted and I'm
the

03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
float uh and um also one of the authors
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
of every single one of those bills
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
that's come come through and so you
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
should know quite a lot about them by
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
now and you could see from the previous
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
discussion that there are a lot of
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
people in a lot of places that do not
 
03:39:31.710 --> 03:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
cannot figure out how to get adquate
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
legal representation to be able to use
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
the option which is taking it to a court
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
um we had early on two guys from a
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
largest Association condo association in
 
03:39:49.319 --> 03:39:50.429 align:start position:0%
largest Association condo association in
uh

03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
nashwa on who were on the association
 
03:39:57.630 --> 03:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
consisted of a main block and then an
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
extra block they tacked on and they were
 
03:40:03.309 --> 03:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
in the extra block that they tacked on
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
and um they were all paying the same
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
fees but they were getting a lot less of
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
the stuff they needed done like like
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
fixing the the Flor or that fell in and
 
03:40:21.630 --> 03:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
things like that um and they had enough
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
money they took it to court said they it
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
cost them two years and
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
$20,000 to complete the court case and
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
when they completed it the judge looked
 
03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
at them and said
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
sorrowfully I think that you've really
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
got a problem here and uh I can't do
 
03:40:46.830 --> 03:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
anything about it cuz there's no condo
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
law that was early on and that was why
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
we started putting governance law into
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
the Condominium
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
Association on law which was originally
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
just to catch bad actor developers that
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
were selling to people coming into
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
Condos for the first time that is the
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
condo was built and those new people
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
were coming in and to protect them from
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
bad actor developers there must have
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
been a lot of them at that point I guess
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
because they put that law
 
03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:24.630 align:start position:0%
because they put that law
in

03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:26.830 align:start position:0%
in
um

03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:30.149 --> 03:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
and but since that time there have been
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
years when nobody showed up to talk to
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
us about their problems
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
um some years where we managed to help
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
solve problems uh and the people went
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
away happy and some years when we could
 
03:41:55.630 --> 03:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
not do that uh and people a number of
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
people said that they were leaving New
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
um and then last year when we had a
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
totally new group except for me and and
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
we sat there and the chair uh
 
03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:18.389 align:start position:0%
we sat there and the chair uh
representative

03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
infantine uh decided that we ought to
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
listen to the six people that were there
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
in front of us they were from three
 
03:42:26.120 --> 03:42:27.870 align:start position:0%
in front of us they were from three
different

03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
associations and um had three
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of problems that were
 
03:42:36.910 --> 03:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
all pretty uh
 
03:42:41.309 --> 03:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
mindblowing he had never run into a a
 
03:42:43.870 --> 03:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
badly run Condo Association before he'd
 
03:42:45.630 --> 03:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
been in them
 
03:42:49.469 --> 03:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
and I have not have not had those
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
problems in my homeowners association
 
03:42:57.070 --> 03:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of places where
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
where people fall through the cracks
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
there are also places where we get
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
complaints from people who who want
 
03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
their neighbor to be told that that they
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't smoke on their deck cu the
 
03:43:11.349 --> 03:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
other person's allergic to smoke and
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing we can't do anything
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
about I call them the pink FL Flamingo
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
bills requests so and
 
03:43:26.910 --> 03:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
but we really need some kind of board
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
like the manufactured housing board was
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board did um
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
put all of its decisions into the court
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
the court took the kept the decisions
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
filed for 6 months and then entered them
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
in as case
 
03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:49.550 align:start position:0%
in as case
law

03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:43:54.990 --> 03:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
and the um what was then then not the
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
oplc on took all of the decisions and
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
put them up on their website in a
 
03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:04.950 align:start position:0%
put them up on their website in a
prominent

03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
place and my opinion of why they ran out
 
03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
of things to do was that they'd run out
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
of most of the things that could
 
03:44:12.439 --> 03:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
of most of the things that could
possibly

03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
happen until
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
till the cost of housing and everything
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
started to change everything um but the
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
current new head of the
 
03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:29.149 align:start position:0%
current new head of the
oplc

03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
um does not think she can take this the
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board back she
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
thinks some version of it should
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
continue um and
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
she uh has committed to keeping that
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
website and putting it in another more
 
03:44:49.950 --> 03:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
prominent place
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
again if we manag if we decide that we
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
need to have a manufactured housing
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
board as a subsection of maybe the
 
03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
housing um
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
board um while we're deciding about
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
Condominiums um that's something that
 
03:45:19.469 --> 03:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
um that that um could go along with the
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board which would
 
03:45:24.990 --> 03:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
probably be limited to very rare
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
occasions when they have to talk but
 
03:45:29.550 --> 03:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
maybe not it sounds like things are
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
really changing a lot again in in
 
03:45:32.960 --> 03:45:34.469 align:start position:0%
really changing a lot again in in
trailer

03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
parks and so anyway on the condominium
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
side on we
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
have no higher authority except the
 
03:45:46.510 --> 03:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
district court
 
03:45:51.070 --> 03:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
s and the district courts are
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and the people who can
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
manage to find a condo lawyer and uh
 
03:46:02.229 --> 03:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
your chair gave me a list or got me a
 
03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
list of the lawyers that would listen
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I called all of them
 
03:46:13.229 --> 03:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
and three of them said that they would
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
talk to a
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
condominium group or o or owner that
 
03:46:22.030 --> 03:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
were um were trying to figure out what
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
to do um only two of them had and they
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
um listened to them and then
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
commiserated with
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
them but just told him sorry uh nobody's
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to take that case one of them um
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
the best one of them actually in my
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
terms in terms of of being understanding
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
about the problem uh said that what
 
03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is not about enough
 
03:46:56.670 --> 03:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
this so um I didn't get terribly far
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
with that except to can little inform
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
you to ask a question do you know how
 
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
much money um it might cost to to
 
03:47:12.149 --> 03:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
reinstitute Institute a
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
board yes you got a fiscal note right
 
03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:15.790 align:start position:0%
board yes you got a fiscal note right
here

03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me the fiscal note is
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the previous
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
oplc right person who also these numbers
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
look a little high yeah they are
 
03:47:31.469 --> 03:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
definitely High she staffed entirely
 
03:47:31.479 --> 03:47:33.070 align:start position:0%
definitely High she staffed entirely
with

03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:47:36.269 --> 03:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
lawyers we wanted
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
one the the the place had the board had
 
03:47:43.149 --> 03:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board had been
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
staffed by one
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh at first full-time and later
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
on part-time on
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
clerk who was
 
03:48:02.670 --> 03:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
on figuring getting in all the
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
complaints on classifying them according
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
to topic and then um putting out doing
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
the minutes of course and putting out
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
the the uh call for the meeting
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
to to the heads the the owners of the
 
03:48:26.910 --> 03:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
manfactured housing board and the the
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
03:48:35.070 --> 03:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
complainants and and then um taking
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
minutes at the
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
meeting and that doesn't need a law
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
degree right right
 
03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
and the biggest problem that I've I see
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
in doing something like this is is that
 
03:48:52.990 --> 03:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
the condominium
 
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
law is a very large
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
chapter and so um we're going to need a
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer who is as the manufactured
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
housing board person was uh doing
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
retirement and understand and has done
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
some condominium work that would be on
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
that board so bottom line representative
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
is that you want to move forward with
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
this bill I am still you're still going
 
03:49:26.910 --> 03:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do that looking to look forward move
 
03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
forward with it representative infantine
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
wants me to finish writing it first and
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
then decide whether he wants to come in
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
on it and um Whitley had who was on the
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
committee has uh moved on so at this
 
03:49:44.120 --> 03:49:45.990 align:start position:0%
committee has uh moved on so at this
juncture

03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
juncture
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
what what if anything do you need from
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
us other than to wait for the bill to
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
come out to to take a gander at it I
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't need anything from you I was kind
 
03:49:57.550 --> 03:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
of surprised you were having a meeting
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
about it again but but it gives the
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this gentleman to talk
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
to why he thinks we shouldn't have it at
 
03:50:09.630 --> 03:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
all so okay so we have you wanted to
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
speak sir
 
03:50:10.880 --> 03:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
speak sir
I

03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
sure what's it
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes oh I wanted to know that that's real
 
03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:25.070 align:start position:0%
yes oh I wanted to know that that's real
that's

03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.149 --> 03:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
true well good afternoon hello my name
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
is uh dick sweat I'm a resident of The
 
03:50:35.910 --> 03:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
Vineyards Condominium Association in
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
stratum New Hampshire we are a
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association we are governed
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
by RSA
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
356b and after hearing the tales of the
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing people I certainly
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
think that combining these two types of
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
organizations is not a good idea I mean
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have totally different uh uh
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
structures uh we have uh our ownership
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
is is different our our uh problems are
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
different I just really don't see a
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
combination of these two groups I think
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
they should be separate uh the man
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing board should be
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
under their RSA condominium should be
 
03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:20.070 align:start position:0%
under their RSA condominium should be
under

03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
356b I've lived on a Condominium
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
Association for 16 years I've uh served
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
on the board for six years I was
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
president of the association for four
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
years I'm presently uh chairman of the
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
condominium Leadership Council and I'm
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
also representing the New Hampshire
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee today Gary
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
didario couldn't be here either could
 
03:51:44.670 --> 03:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
Don lenon they asked me to step in there
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
in their shoes uh this bill HB uh 1645
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
as representative alme said has been
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
around for a number of years it's also
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
very similar to a bill that was passed
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
in in the senate senate Bill 324 in the
 
03:52:06.149 --> 03:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
2022 session and the house committee
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
declared that bill as inexpedient to
 
03:52:12.189 --> 03:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
legislate this bill that we're looking
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
at the 1645 is quite similar uh to that
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think one of the major issues
 
03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
we have here is
 
03:52:25.630 --> 03:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
that the RSA
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
356b said promotes the concept of
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
self-government for Condominiums once we
 
03:52:34.750 --> 03:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
get into a condominium dispute board I
 
03:52:38.189 --> 03:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
think we are taking away that concept of
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
self-government uh during my years of a
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
board our our resident disputes have
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
been settled within the framework of the
 
03:52:49.760 --> 03:52:51.110 align:start position:0%
been settled within the framework of the
condominium

03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
declaration the condominium bylaws and
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
the rules that's how we have solved and
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
settled our disputes on the members of
 
03:53:00.840 --> 03:53:01.830 align:start position:0%
settled our disputes on the members of
the

03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
condominium uh dispute board I think uh
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
we have to think
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
that Condominiums are not all the same I
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
mean there are
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
owner occupied Condominiums my
 
03:53:21.389 --> 03:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association 76 units is
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
totally owner occupied uh we and that's
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
how we govern ourselves there are other
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
condominium units that have investors in
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
them they do rentals uh either on a
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
lease for a a year if that's what the
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
bylaws call for or they could even do
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
vrbos which can cause problems for the
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and uh they're also the
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
seasonal owners there are tension in in
 
03:53:49.950 --> 03:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
these groups the seasonal owners the
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
investors like low monthly fees whereas
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
the owners want to maintain and have
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
preventive maintenance issues to protect
 
03:54:04.149 --> 03:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
their investment and they like to have a
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
good solid Reserve account if to have a
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
good solid Reserve account you're going
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
to be paying higher monthly dues and
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's what some investors see looners
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
and other people don't want I would say
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
the procedure to follow to file a
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
complaint with the dispute board uh
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
really bypasses the framework of
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
condominium declarations condominium
 
03:54:33.389 --> 03:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
bylaws in our rules I think the idea
 
03:54:35.670 --> 03:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a mediator
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
within the dispute resolution board uh
 
03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:39.710 align:start position:0%
within the dispute resolution board uh
kind

03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
kind
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
of Intimates that the board might not
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
want to handle all disputes and if they
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
send them to a mediator as somebody
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out a mediator is not binding
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
they're not an arbitrator they are a
 
03:54:56.590 --> 03:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
mediator a mediator also charges pretty
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
heavy fees for their time so that would
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
be an additional expense I don't think
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
the procedure timeline for solving these
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
disputes is particularly timely I mean
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
it it it's something where these
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
disputes are going to go on for a
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
considerable period of time I think
 
03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
there's one issue in here that's really
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
quite Troublesome and I'll read this
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
statement the board meaning the dispute
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
board shall not be bound by common law
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
or statutary Rules of Evidence but may
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
admit all testimony having a reasonable
 
03:55:35.469 --> 03:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
probative value it may exclude evidence
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
which in the opinion of the board is
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
immaterial irrelevant or unduly
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
repetitious that's the end of that quote
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this provision does
 
03:55:48.830 --> 03:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
not provide sufficient checks and
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
balances for this board's
 
03:55:53.790 --> 03:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
deliberations I think the initial
 
03:55:56.670 --> 03:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
determinate unit owners can complain
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
about the boards but can the boards
 
03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
bring a dispute about a particular unit
 
03:56:04.590 --> 03:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
owner to the board for resolution uh the
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
initial determination about the validity
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
of owner complaints are made to the
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
dispute board but before the association
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
receives any information about the
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
owner's dispute where is the
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
transparency here uh the dispute board
 
03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
will receive legal assistance provided
 
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Justice condominium
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
boards appearing before the dispute
 
03:56:29.269 --> 03:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
board will probably have to go and get
 
03:56:32.070 --> 03:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
an attorney to advise themselves as
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to be having an attorney
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
opposing them from the Department of
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
Justice which is going to be uh advising
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
the dispute
 
03:56:40.520 --> 03:56:42.389 align:start position:0%
the dispute
board

03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh all in all the dispute
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
board really doesn't have any full
 
03:56:53.670 --> 03:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
remedy I mean their remedy is to file uh
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh a uh an appeal with the superior
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
court and then the Superior Court would
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
then enforce the re the the decisions of
 
03:57:05.870 --> 03:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
the dispute board I mean this is kind of
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
circular in a sense because if you do
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
have a dispute that's where you go you
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
go to the superior court of the district
 
03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
court so um I I have to say that uh the
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
establishment of the dispute resolution
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
board would bypass a concept of
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
self-government set up a time consuming
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
procedural process attorney
 
03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
Fe and services and remedies would be
 
03:57:35.550 --> 03:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
dis administered by the Superior Court
 
03:57:38.110 --> 03:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
the court that presently handles such
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
disputes so the organizations that I I I
 
03:57:44.910 --> 03:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
I represent really
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh one would
 
03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
not agree or would like to see a
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
combination of manufactured housing and
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
condominium dispute boards and two we
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
think the RSA
 
03:58:03.269 --> 03:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.149 --> 03:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient framework with which to solve
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
disputes and also it's very difficult to
 
03:58:11.710 --> 03:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
get people to run for the board of
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
directors and if people do have
 
03:58:15.550 --> 03:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
complaints they should run for the board
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
of directors in our Condominium
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
Association we have term limits on the
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
board just to uh make sure we have board
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
turnover but anyway that is my
 
03:58:30.670 --> 03:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you for listening to
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
me do
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
respect uh representativ Al's thoughts
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
about needing protection for some groups
 
03:58:45.870 --> 03:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
but uh I think the I think the size of
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
these condominium associations is is is
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
important too they can size can run from
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
two units which are called conexes you
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
know they're like duplexes two units
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
conexes they can be under RS
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
56b to units of five 500 units so this I

it would be the status of HB 1645 I mean
 
03:59:39.080 --> 03:59:40.590 align:start position:0%
it would be the status of HB 1645 I mean
is

03:59:40.590 --> 03:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
it well I guess it depend if but
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:52.910 --> 03:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
hear it's dead but but representative
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
Aly can do a new bill I understand I was
 
03:59:57.630 --> 03:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
just I just didn't quite understand what
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
the pro I didn't understand what the
 
04:00:01.710 --> 04:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
procedure was here but I mean on the
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
octob there's a meeting supposedly on
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
October 17th where the full committee is
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
again yeah yeah that's I didn't know it
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
was the 17th
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
what happens there
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
nothing so there's no need for anybody
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
up so I mean the bottom line is that
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to die and then you know rep
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
