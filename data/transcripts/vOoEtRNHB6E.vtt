I'm here to provide economic update and
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
let me just quickly go through some
 
00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
topics for today this being my first
 
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
time coming before this group wanted to
 
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
just tell you a little bit about myself
 
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
and the organization I work for and then
 
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
the main topic of the day uh wanted to
 
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 align:start position:0%
focus on inflation that being the
 
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 align:start position:0%
critical driver of economic performance
 
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
uh this coming year and uh key policy
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
choices that uh the Federal Reserve will
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to make all depends on what happens
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
with inflation this year so that'll be
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
the focus of my comments today so I'd
 
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
list here kind of six things that have
 
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
contributed to kind of the very high
 
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
levels of inflation that we've seen
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a quick preview what
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
are the six things
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
supply chain bottlenecks that's number
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
one number two is the war in Ukraine
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
leading to a big increase in Energy
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
prices number three relaxation of covet
 
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions leading to a surge in
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
demand for travel
 
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
number four is household savings uh
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
becoming very high during the pandemic
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
number five is home prices and number
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
six is a labor shortage which I know you
 
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
discussed with some of the State labor
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
economists yesterday afternoon so I'll
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
make some comments about that as well
 
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then I'll make some comments about
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve policy and provide an
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
outlook on the US economy and make some
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
comments about the New England economy
 
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.090 align:start position:0%
comments about the New England economy
okay

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
I look so we have a question up front
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
yes I didn't I noticed that you didn't
 
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
mention the amount of cash circulating
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
the the inflation is from uh
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
overspending by the federal government
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh I'll come to that I think that'll be
 
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
related to the topic of excess savings
 
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
uh that will come to I would remind
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
members that this is not a place for you
 
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
to make statements about your beliefs
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
this is a place for you to ask very
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
polite clarifying questions of our
 
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
presenters thank you
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just wondering if you could
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
if you're going to or can you
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
um Define what you mean by inflation is
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
there a particular metric I certainly
 
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
can't yes
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
can I come to that in in two minutes all
 
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
right I'll start Michael remarks on that
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
let me start tell you a little bit about
 
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
myself so uh as Madam chair just
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned I am Senior vice president of
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and research at the
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
Federal Bank of Boston and
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I get to do this at industry events
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
and with our member institutions
 
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
throughout New England
 
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
so the organization I work for I wanted
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
to just tell you a little bit
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
um in 2022 last year we celebrated our
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
20th year anniversary
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
um we are a wholesale Bank lending to
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
member institutions throughout New
 
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.890 align:start position:0%
member institutions throughout New
England

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 align:start position:0%
England
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it happens it just happens that the
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
longest member that has been with us and
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
has been using our services is a New
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire member a Salem cooperative
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
bank and they've been a member of our
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
Organization for almost 90 years and
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
soon it'll be 100 years so on the next
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
page you see here the institutions who
 
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 align:start position:0%
are members of the federal Home Bank of
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
Austin just about every Community Bank
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
and uh many of the larger credit unions
 
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
and many of the insurance companies are
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
members of our cooperative and they use
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
us for their liquidity and funding
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
purposes and many organizations use us
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing programs as well
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
in Community Development
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
okay with that uh background out of the
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
way here let's get to the topic so very
 
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
good question what do we mean by
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
inflation here
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about inflation we're
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the general price level so
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the general price
 
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
level we're talking about households
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
consumption baskets so uh each of us
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
represent a household and we all have
 
00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 align:start position:0%
consumption baskets we consume goods and
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
services Goods including things like
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
food apparel things that we buy services
 
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
like Medical Services
 
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
transportation services uh and things
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
things like mortgage payments are
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
considered Services as well so all those
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
have price levels associated with them
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
and economists at the Bureau of Labor
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
Statistics work hard to bring all those
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
prices into a single metric and that's
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
the general consumption price index and
 
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
then when we talk about inflation we're
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
talking about how much did that general
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
price level change year over year
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
do that help okay okay so on that point
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
before uh at 8 30 this morning uh right
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
before uh we started this session there
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
was a the newest uh Consumer Price
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
inflation report was released and uh I
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're like economists
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
looking for this report every month and
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
you know five minutes in you you've kind
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
of reviewed all the data in case you
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I was looking for the report and I
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
saw it right after it came out let me
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
just tell you that there's good news so
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price inflation peaked at 9.1
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
percent in June of this year
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
the latest reading for December is 6.5
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
so it's been trending in the in the
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
right direction but arguably it is still
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
too high and the quick quite the
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
uh how quickly will it come down to the
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
Federal reserve's target of two percent
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
inflation per year
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of what I want to
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:51.620 align:start position:0%
um perspective on on a core basis
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
because prices of food prices of energy
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
can be quite volatile sometimes the BLS
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
will track core inflation numbers
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
excluding food and energy prices and
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
that came in at 5.7 year-over-year
 
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.590 align:start position:0%
that came in at 5.7 year-over-year
change

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
an improvement over a peak of 6.6
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
so headline inflation has come down from
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
Peak numbers earlier uh in the middle of
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
last year and then on a core basis
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
inflation has come down as well so
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging signs but these levels are
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
still much too high uh if you talk to
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
any of the FED officials the target is
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
is closer to a two percent level so
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
anything about five or six or those are
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
very high numbers and they're looking to
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
bring those numbers down
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay so to provide perspective on how
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
these numbers are trending whether we're
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
likely to see substantial moderation in
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
inflation numbers I just I thought that
 
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
it might help if we just walk through
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
each of the reasons why inflation has
 
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
been so high over the past year and then
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
kind of look at some data that might
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
point us to uh some Trends and and that
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
could help us notice some patterns okay
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the first
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh reason here which is the supply chain
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
issue in the middle of 2021 I like many
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh Americans were was working fully from
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
home working totally remotely not going
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
to the office at all and I wanted a
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of a nicer home office so I
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
went to a furniture store to buy a new
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
couch and the salesperson told me after
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
I pointed out one that I liked okay
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're looking at six months for that to
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
get delivered to your house because the
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
factory in Vietnam is shut down and even
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
if they come back online and start
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
manufacturing their sofas it'll take a
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
very long time for that to get here
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
because of the bottleneck in Supply
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
chains and delivery times having
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
increased a lot so one example of that
 
00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
is this news article from uh late 2021
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
where outside the LA Port which accepts
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 of All Imports coming into the
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
United States they were close to a
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
hundred ships they were unable to Dock
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
and unload their cargo and so that just
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know it's like right outside it's
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
here the ships have come here arrived
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
and yet they're because of the supply
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
chain issues labor shortage issues uh
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
they were unable to unload their cargo
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that kind of thing Supply constrained
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
supply and demand if if it's strong
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
that'll tend to raise prices of these
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
Goods kind of coming into the country
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
so what's happened since then to the
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
backlog of container ships and cargo
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
ships so this is a a chart that shows
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
the number of uh ships waiting to dock
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
at the LA Port and again that's one of
 
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
the most important ports for imports
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
coming into the country and what it
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
shows is that throughout 2021 things got
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
progressively worse with the number of
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
ships that are waiting uh Rising
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and it got to kind
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
of the peak level over 100 ships waiting
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
to uh come into the port in the early
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
part of 2022 about a year ago when it
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
was when it was at the kind of the worst
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
peak of this problem
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
but the good news here is that
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
throughout 2022 this problem has really
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
eased and if you look at the kind of the
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
most recent data points for October it
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
shows that uh We've almost solved this
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
problem we don't have nearly as many
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
ships that are activating uh to dock at
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the LA Port so uh very good news and
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
so this is uh seems like this issue is
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
really in the rear view mirror here in
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
terms of causing supply chain
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks and causing uh putting
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
pressures on inflation
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
it turns out that this story is actually
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
part of a broader Global story which is
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
very positive supply chain pressures
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
across the world are easing which is
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
great for uh inflation so because this
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
issue has become very important uh for
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh prices and and pressures on inflation
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
been tracking this new index
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
which they call the global supply chain
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
pressure index based on two things one
 
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:09.620 align:start position:0%
thing is how much does it cost
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
to ship something let's say I have a
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility in Shanghai and I
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
finish making uh something there and
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
then I want to ship it to the US how
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
much does it cost
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing they track and the
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
other thing is how long does it take and
 
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:26.660 align:start position:0%
so it takes into account things like uh
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
backlogs at La ports and and things of
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
that nature so the higher this number
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
the worse the problem the higher this
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
number the worse the pressures on Supply
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
chains and the more expensive it is the
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
longer it takes to bring Goods into the
 
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:42.740 align:start position:0%
US the lower it is the better the the
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
dark horizontal line at zero represents
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
the historical average and what it shows
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
is that throughout the pandemic we've
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
really had supply chain challenges
 
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.300 align:start position:0%
almost from the get-go due to lockdowns
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
in many places around the world
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
especially in China where a lot of
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing happens as well as the
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
challenges with delivery and other
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and it really peaked
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
in the about a year ago in the first uh
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2022 but again good news this
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
problem has been getting better
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
throughout 2022 so delivery time is
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
coming down cost is coming down so these
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
are all kind of relieving some pressure
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
on inflation on this front
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the first reason supply
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
chain so I think this is good news if
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing that was going on
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
and this is the only thing that was
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
driving inflation I think we would not
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
have an inflation problem going forward
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
so this is good news here
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
um let's go to the next issue which is
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
energy and commodity prices so as we all
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
know uh June of last year 2022 is when
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
gas prices peaked uh national average
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
right a little above five dollars and I
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
think it was above five dollars here in
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then throughout New
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
England as well the photo here shows at
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
California where there's the prices are
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
okay so what how has the the trend
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
looked uh so far so the big increase
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
came uh in the early part of 2022
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
following uh Russia's invasion of
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
Ukraine Russia being a major exporter of
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
both uh crude oil and a natural gas so
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
those uh sanctions placed on them and so
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
on so that put a lot of pressure on this
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
market and prices uh sharply increased
 
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
in uh the earlier part of 2022 reaching
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
a peak uh just above five dollars
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
average Across the Nation in June of
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
this year but as we know as we know from
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
kind of watching and then filling up at
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
gas stations that price has come down
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
quite a bit uh and and we're right now
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're at the low threes uh and uh so
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's a very positive trend so there's
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
a downward uh Trend here uh and uh that
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
the important thing here remember that
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
when I Defined inflation at the very
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
beginning it's an annual metric that the
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
FED is targeting so compared to the same
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
time last year where our price is today
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
so it's not so let's say gas prices
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
today are 320 per gallon so that's still
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
high compared to pre-pandemic but that's
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
not what we're measuring we're measuring
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
compared to a year ago where price is
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
today and and if you look at this chart
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
here and you track sort of where things
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
were a year ago were lower today uh a
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
year ago gas prices were even higher
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
than 320 or wherever we are now so uh
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
that would represent a positive
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
development if so year over year gas
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
prices even though the level is high the
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
change from last year might be uh uh in
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
the right direction meaning it's low or
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
even possibly even negative
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
so there would tend to be a positive
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
factor for inflation
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay that was gasoline prices the other
 
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.410 align:start position:0%
okay that was gasoline prices the other
important

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.069 align:start position:0%
important
um

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
energy uh source of course is
 
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.490 align:start position:0%
energy uh source of course is
electricity

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
and electric electricity prices have
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
risen through for most of 2022
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
but they did reach a peak in September
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
and the most recent data I have are for
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
October and November and prices did come
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
down for those two months so again
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
positive news there would love to see
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
electric prices come down further but at
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
least uh you know it's a little or too
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
early to call this a trend but at least
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh for the most two recent months we
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
have data for things are moving in the
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
right direction there and hopefully uh
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
we did see a peak there
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
could we interrupt for just a moment
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's a representative
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
behind you representative McGuire has a
 
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:47.630 align:start position:0%
behind you representative McGuire has a
question

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
and we're heading into the winter season
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
so a lot of natural gas gets diverted to
 
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.210 align:start position:0%
so a lot of natural gas gets diverted to
Heating

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
Heating
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
should we expect electricity prices to
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
go up more
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
so that's an excellent question so
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative's exactly right
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
electricity prices have a lot to do with
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices so I didn't show here
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
but I also took a look at at natural gas
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
prices so natural gas prices do not show
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
a shop increase as as of right now and
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
what they're expected to going forward I
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
think it's a little hard to tell it
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
depends on the severity of the weather
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
how cold it gets in the winter here in
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the world so far it's
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
been a mild winter that's helped uh so I
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
think that would that would drive a lot
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
of the short-term movements and beyond
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
that I think uh kind of the geopolitical
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
things kind of come into play there
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
what's happening in Ukraine and Russia
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
and so on so but at least so far we
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a kind of a big rise that
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
would tell us that uh you know a big
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
rise in electricity prices are coming so
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
far thank you
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you madam
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
chair I wonder if you could uh give us
 
00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:53.299 align:start position:0%
some specific information
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
concerning uh utility prices electrical
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
prices uh in New Hampshire and
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
particularly as compared to the rest of
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
the region
 
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.289 align:start position:0%
the region
um

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
that I don't have data up where I'm
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
sorry I I don't have specific data on
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
YouTube the prices for the state as well
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
but I I would think that there are some
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
state-specific factors but I would
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
imagine these general price movements
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
happening Across the Nation even across
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the world are a big part of what would
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
drive state level data as well but there
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
might be some specific State specific
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
factors that I haven't looked at
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
carefully thank you thank you madam
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
chair there's another representative
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
behind you behind the screen to
 
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:43.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
act would help drop the pressure on our
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
electricity right yeah I think I think
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a big question
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think a waiver of the Jones act
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
in my view so that that's a kind of
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a political issue there too but
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
it might be a very positive thing for
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
yes right right I think at the purely
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
purely from an economic perspective I
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
think it would make it easier to
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
transport things within this within the
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
nation and it would I think reduce
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
um what about food so Ukraine Russia is
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
a major exporter of oil and uh um
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
natural gas Ukraine is number five or
 
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
natural gas Ukraine is number five or
six

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
um in the world in terms of exports of
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
of uh wheat and corn
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
um and so we did see a sharp rise in uh
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
food commodity prices I'm showing here
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
the price of corn in blue and the price
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
of wheat in red uh so a big increase uh
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
in fact there's there was a trend
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
preceding even The Invasion uh in early
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
2022 but there was a sharp rise
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
following the invasion in February of 22
 
00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.950 align:start position:0%
following the invasion in February of 22
uh

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the levels are high but again good
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
news here I think there was a a big drop
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
off in the price of wheat in as you can
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
see in red there and the price of corn
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
seems to have stabilized it did rise but
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
then uh more stable
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
so if I'm trying to project inflation
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
this this is going to say that for some
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
time you know if you compare to like a
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
year ago it's going to reflect that big
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
increase that that's happened but uh you
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
know it is now January it'll soon be
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
February and March and and we're gonna
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
get past the period when we saw the big
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
increase in the early part of 22 and at
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
that point the year-over-year change is
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
not going to be as dramatic so I was I
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
would think that as long as the trends
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
continue here this is going to represent
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
a moderating force on inflation
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
so again a sort of a positive story so
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
the general story there is that energy
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
and food prices by the way
 
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.169 align:start position:0%
and food prices by the way
um

00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
when you when you construct this uh
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
inflation metric by looking at household
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
consumption baskets The crucial thing is
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
how much weight do you put on different
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
components like how how much do
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
households spend on the various
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
components of this basket that we're
 
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:10.340 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
food is is 13 it changes uh from time to
 
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
food is is 13 it changes uh from time to
time

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
so that's a pick that we spent a lot of
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
money at grocery stores you know buying
 
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
food for our families energy is about
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
nine percent so that's uh you know us
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know filling up our uh cars
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
and so together it's a little over 20.
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a fifth of of the
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
whole basket there and so what happens
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
to these prices are very important for
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
inflation and the general story is yes
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
they did contribute very substantial to
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
inflation over the past year but going
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
forward it seems that as long as the
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
current trends continue that they will
 
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.610 align:start position:0%
current trends continue that they will
uh

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
be a moderating force in inflation going
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
did anyone have travel plans canceled
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
for over the past three years
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
I had a big international trip planned
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
for April 2020 of course we have to
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
cancel that and then we thought okay
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to travel
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
internationally but let's do a national
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
parks uh trip to Utah and Nevada and
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
even that somehow we ended up scheduling
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
during the one of the waves or something
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
so that got canceled uh and so we're
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
looking to schedule maybe a bigger trip
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and I imagine others of you might
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
have done something similar as well but
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
so big news last year was that this
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
thing called Revenge travel uh where
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we're kind of stuck at home not
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
able to travel for some time folks were
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
eager to kind of get out and travel
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
domestically and internationally so that
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
represented huge demand for things like
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
air travel uh transportation services uh
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
cars and things like that and there was
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
a question as to how much of that was
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
driving uh inflation in those sectors
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
so here's a chart here so what's shown
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
in blue is the price of airfares and
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
what's shown in red is the price of
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
lodging so the price of staying at
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
hotels and so on
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
so what do you see here
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
um what you see is that in the uh middle
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
of 2021 there is that bump that you see
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the smaller bump uh in the
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
middle of 2021 so there was summer of
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
2021 after being at home for a full year
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
and more people were wanting to get out
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and there was a sort of significant
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
demand for travel
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and and then but then in in the
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
summer of 22 about six months ago is
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
when this really took off and airfares
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
were increasing at very dramatic rates
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
and contributed substantial to inflation
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
so two things happened that really
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
exacerbated this issue one was people
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to travel more uh there was
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
demand for air error uh travel was high
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time what's the biggest cost
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
of Airlines fuel prices and of course
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere of 22 is when gas prices were
 
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
therapeutic oil prices went their Peak
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
and this this was a tough uh time to
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
sort of manage fuel costs and so
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
Airlines responded by raising prices a
 
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.890 align:start position:0%
Airlines responded by raising prices a
lot

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
so in my family it's sometimes once
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
every few years traveled to the West
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
Coast to see family and usually all five
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
of us go but last year we saw the
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
airfares and they were double uh what we
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
would have expected even considering
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
that it was summer time so only two of
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
us ended up traveling instead of five so
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh we lost a little bit of GDP we had
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
all five of us traveled we would have
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
contributed more to National output than
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
than we did with just two of us
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
traveling so airfares increased
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
dramatically in 22
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
eye-popping levels they were like
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
doubling uh or more and
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but what about now so that happened
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
what about now so that's the critical
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
issue here and if you look at the
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
pattern of the Blue Line since about
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
June of 22 it's been coming down okay so
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
if you do it year over year on this
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
number what is it's going to say that
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
year over year it's still a very
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
positive high high change it's it's a
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
very inflationary sector because
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
compared to a year ago airfares are much
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.409 align:start position:0%
much higher
but

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
at some point this year we're going to
 
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
get past that period when that big
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
change happened and at that point we're
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
going to be in that downward portion if
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
the trend continues past June of 22
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
we're gonna eventually the year over
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
year calculation will cover that period
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to see moderation
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
inflation if not an outright decline in
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
airfares in the price level and that'd
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
be very positive for inflation
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
hotel prices shown in the red line uh
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
also increased starting in the middle of
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
21 but not quite as dramatically and
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
they've stabilized so we're not seeing
 
00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:06.500 align:start position:0%
these big increases in hotel prices
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
lodging uh prices as we did for airfare
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
so that seems positive positive again if
 
00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:14.059 align:start position:0%
you do kind of a year over year change
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to show a little bit of a
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative almie has a
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
question yes please thank you I'm afraid
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
I should have asked this in the second
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
previous segment but on in other parts
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
on food is a lot larger part of the
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
budget than it is here and in other
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
parts of the world the cost of fuel is a
 
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:45.140 align:start position:0%
lot higher than it is here yes and on
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
we've we're coming through a period when
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
we don't know where we're going to end
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
up but at what point do you start
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
looking at the Market Basket again and
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
decide okay food is a larger part of the
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
budget or energy is a larger part of the
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
budget very good question I think uh
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
your comments about uh internationally
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
that basket looking different are spot
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
on I think the our basket reflects kind
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the wealth of this nation and and
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
what it what it is that we're able to
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
spend uh kind of our income on so we
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
spent far more on travel Services uh and
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
things like that than other countries
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
might so the basket would look really
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
different if you did an international
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
comparison but even even within the US
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
the basket
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
could and would change uh just over time
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's part of the
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
the updates that the the Bureau of Labor
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
Statistics does I think on a monthly
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative soti has a question yes
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um does the lodging portion do
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
you include the Airbnb in those type of
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I had the same question does Airbnb
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
get included in this I don't know the
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
answer to that it will definitely
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
include traditional lodging places
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
I would think that Airbnb has been
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
around long enough and and uh important
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
enough that but I I don't know the
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
specific answer there I should look into
 
00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:08.590 align:start position:0%
specific answer there I should look into
it

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Jen again has a question
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking our questions uh
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that energy was about
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
nine percent of the basket uh cost uh
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
for for a household I'm wondering uh do
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
you know what percent energy is of the
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
um so that's a good question when I say
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
nine percent that's about consumer uh
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
consumption basket personal consumption
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
expenditures how much of that goes to
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know gas and electricity when you
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
ask how much of the US economy is energy
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's a different question that's like
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
how much of GDP is attributable to the
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
energy producing sector uh and so on
 
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.289 align:start position:0%
energy producing sector uh and so on
um

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
I don't have I don't have the number off
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
the top of my head there
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get back to you on that one
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
I see lots of questions representative
 
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.130 align:start position:0%
I see lots of questions representative
orders

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we're talking
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
about the weights of the items in the
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
basket and my financial advisor tells me
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
that the items that affect us most on a
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis is about 30 percent so
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
I'm curious what the other items are in
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
the basket
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
that is waiting
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
these items you're talking about only a
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
20 I mean if I'm doing an audit I want
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
to look at 80 so what what's the picture
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the other 80 okay so the other big
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
item which will come to is housing
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
Housing Services is 30 so so
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
most most most households spend a
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
significant part of their income on
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
their mortgage payments and if you if
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
you're not a homeowner then on rent so
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
that represents a very significant
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
portion I mean we talked about this and
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
as you're well aware that's an
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
increasing uh portion of our uh budget
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
for many households so that's about a
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
third very important portion of of
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
the whole economy as well as uh
 
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
the whole economy as well as uh
inflation

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
Medical Services a little under 10 so uh
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
medical medical spending hospital bills
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
and so on that's big
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
um and I'm trying to remember some of
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
the other categories here uh the next
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
topic is is new and used cars and I
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe together they represent about
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
seven percent so you know that's our
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
payments on cars and and the money that
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
we spend so now we're we're starting to
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
get closer to 80 when you add that all
 
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:34.190 align:start position:0%
get closer to 80 when you add that all
up

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I'm looking at
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
charts and a lot of them the ones that
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
have to do with CPI they say U.S city
 
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
have to do with CPI they say U.S city
average

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
is that the U.S average or is it U.S
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
average only of the cities and the
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
second part of it is are there any of
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
these measures that New England or New
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the Northeast has that are
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
significantly different from the whole
 
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
nation on on the latter question I've
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
looked at uh data specifically for New
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
England region and almost always the
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
data I see the region tracks the US very
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
closely and that's that's generally true
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
I mean we we are a small region part of
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
the country so we generally track the
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
rest of the the nation fairly closely on
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
things like prices even even with some
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
variations of course General patterns
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
about how our labor market does
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
employment trends and so on WE track the
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
rest of the nation as well so I haven't
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
seen sort of big areas sectors where we
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
deviate from the rest of nation in a big
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
way I haven't seen that on the first
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
question that's an interesting question
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
the usual data that the the
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports is
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
the the U.S city average is what they
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
report as a headline number now you ask
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
an interesting question this is all
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
based on surveys and so I think that's a
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
function of kind of how the survey is
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
administered but how widely that
 
00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:08.179 align:start position:0%
captures sort of what you might consider
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
non-urban areas is a very good question
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a I don't know the exact
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
okay uh shall we continue here and I'm
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
glad glad to understand questions I'm
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
glad there's a good engagement here
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the other big category is is I
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
apologize I miss someone no not a
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
problem call me has a question
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes please so just quickly on
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
Urban for the federal government
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes means as small as a five
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
thousand I think that might be right
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah depending on do you know which one
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
all right okay so next category is uh
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
used car prices so this was also in the
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
news a lot
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
um shown in red is uh an index of used
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
car prices and then shown in blue are
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
new car prices
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
so what you see here is that throughout
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
2021 especially in the in the latter
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
part of 21 and early part of 22 used car
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
prices went up a lot very dramatically
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
contributed a lot to inflation so use
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
Car Pro use car category you know maybe
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
four percent of the consumption basket
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
but if if there's such a dramatic
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
increase in prices then it can show up
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of moving the overall price
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
level there and you know there was a lot
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
of uh anecdotes people getting appraised
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know their their used cars
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
appraised at dealerships or these online
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh places you can go and sell your cars
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
and getting very surprised by the prices
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
that they were getting
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
new car prices have also been rising I
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
found myself in the unfortunate place of
 
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:53.780 align:start position:0%
needing a new car in April of last year
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
and uh the experience of buying a new
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
car at that time was completely
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
different from any other time that I
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
tried to buy a car
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh dealerships basically the
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
initial conversation was how much of a
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
markup are you willing to pay to buy a
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
car was kind of the conversation so that
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
is immediately about inflation so the
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
the new car prices are going up because
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
the effective price that includes all
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
the markups and and Market adjustments
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
are going to be reflected in inflation
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
so car prices have been going up but
 
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.190 align:start position:0%
so car prices have been going up but
again

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's been happening what's the most
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
recent Trend if you take a look at the
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
red line there uh if you look at the
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
second half of 2022 starting about June
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
or so we are seeing so it has stabilized
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then we're seeing a decline for the
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
most recent you know three four months
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
or so a positive sign so if that Trend
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
continues and and signs are that used
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
car prices continue to come down because
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
there was such a dramatic run up in
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
prices there there it's it's coming back
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
to a more normal levels that would be uh
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
they'll be relieving a lot of pressure
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
on inflation new car prices continue to
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
rise but if you look at the the Blue
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
Line the rate of increase is slowing so
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not falling but the rate
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
of increases slowing again a positive
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
thing for inflation so this is
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
contributing to currently it's
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
contributing to year over year inflation
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
for sure but uh as an Outlook this the
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
trend is in the right direction we might
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
not be seeing quite as big of
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
contributions to inflation from this
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to the next topic here so
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
everyone's pandemic savings are getting
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
smaller how will it affect economy is a
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
recent kind of headline from end of last
 
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.390 align:start position:0%
recent kind of headline from end of last
year

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:44.180 align:start position:0%
so an important
 
00:36:48.609 --> 00:36:48.619 align:start position:0%
observation about U.S households and
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
when you think about an outlook for the
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
economy going forward especially when
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
you ask are we going to have a recession
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
the zero uh or next and how bad will it
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
be if we do
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
one one important thing to think about
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
is is the health of household balance
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
sheets especially how much Christian
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
American households have in terms of
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
savings that could help in the event
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
that uh unemployment to rise or there
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
were to be some economic challenges
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
so to think about this let's think about
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
let's Define savings so this is how uh
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
savings is defined in official
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
statistics you take household disposable
 
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.030 align:start position:0%
statistics you take household disposable
income

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
and then you subtract uh household
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
consumption expenditures and you
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
subtract other outlays and then what's
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
left is saved so that kind of makes
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
sense intuitively
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh so excess savings uh help households
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
get through difficult economic periods
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's one reason why we care about this
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
another factor is that if this is really
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
high and maybe this gets at uh one of
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
Representative questions earlier uh it
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
may fuel high levels of spending uh
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
because when you have a lot of savings
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
you might spend more of that and
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
possibly that could contribute to
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
elevated levels of demand in the economy
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
and lead to inflationary pressures
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
so Federal Reserve estimates that over
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 households accumulated
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
sort of unprecedented levels of excess
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
savings 2.3 trillion
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
why was that disposable income was high
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
so a lot of this was the result of cares
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
act American Rescue plan act transfers
 
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
from federal government households which
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
was meant to offset uh some of the the
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
wage income losses and business income
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
losses during that time uh but it it it
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
did more than offset so the net impact
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
was that households did have uh to see
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
their savings increase uh during this
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
period the other important driver is
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
that we can our consumption was low our
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
expenditures were low my international
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
trip which would have cost a good amount
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
didn't happen so all that went to
 
00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:55.069 align:start position:0%
didn't happen so all that went to
savings

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and then the extra sofa that I wanted
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
to buy for my home office I didn't buy
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
buy one so that went to savings as well
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
so things like that led to our uh
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
savings going up so that's lower
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
consumption and then other outlays lower
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
interest payments from uh forbearance
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
and student loans lower or interest
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
rates all of that helped to increase
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
savings during the time and that led to
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
sort of very very high levels of what
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
you might call excess savings comparing
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
actual savings to what you might have
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
expected based on historical trends
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
so on the next page
 
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.890 align:start position:0%
so on the next page
uh

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
the truck excuse me we have a quick
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
question yes please representative
 
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.930 align:start position:0%
question yes please representative
Southworth

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
Southworth
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
um of course these are averages and um I
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
mean I'm thinking much of the population
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
did not have excess savings and so that
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the just like we have an upside
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
down pyramid for our business taxes and
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
things with the top really accounting
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
for most of it I'm wondering if that
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
same thing may be part of those numbers
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely a very very important Point
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and absolutely right we're talking
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
about aggregate in the aggregate when
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
you kind of add up all American
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
households how things look that's what
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
this data show here what's what is not
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
captured here is the distribution within
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
kind of the aggregate numbers so the FED
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
study that I referenced and and there's
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
a link to that study in the bottom of
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
the slide does get into the
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
distributional issues so very important
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
to note that not surprisingly when you
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
look at sort of excess savings we were
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
talking 2.3 trillion of very very large
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
numbers a large majority of that is is
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
held by high income households
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
that said when you look at lower income
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
households so this is based on some
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
studies I've seen recently and you ask
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
questions like hey how much do people
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
have in their checking accounts now uh
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
for lower income households today versus
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
what they had in 2019 before the
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
pandemic the checking account balances
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
apparently are higher so there's some
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
sense in which some of this excess
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
saving it's not going to be a large
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
majority or anything but some is held by
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
lower income households but it is the
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
case that a large majority is is held by
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
a higher income households
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
okay so chart of the right here is is
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
the fed's estimate of excess savings so
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
it peaked uh at about 2.3 trillion and
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's now coming down
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
some estimate that this number is coming
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
down by about 100 billion dollars a
 
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.069 align:start position:0%
down by about 100 billion dollars a
month

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
and if I just take that number and let's
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know say that that estimate is
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
correct then it says that by about the
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
end of 23 we'll have exhausted uh the
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
excess savings and it would have kind of
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
returned to pre-pandemic kind of levels
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
well as representative
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair I want
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
to dwell on that for a moment if the if
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
excess savings are gone by end of 2023
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
what does that say about uh the future
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
economy could there be recession uh
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
could there be uh uh instead of
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
inflation deflation people because
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
people aren't buying yeah so uh good
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
question so uh what would happen if the
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
excess savings that we American
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
households currently have
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
are exhausted so one thing people uh
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
talk about is that the fact that
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
Americans are sitting on such high
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
levels of excess savings is a good thing
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
and is protecting us against like very
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
severe downside risk in terms of a
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
recession because even if there were to
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
be a recession because of the high
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
levels of interest rates and so on the
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
fact that uh household balance sheets in
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
the aggregate there's a distributional
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
issue here of course High income low
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
income but in the aggregate the fact
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
that a lot of excess savings means that
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's purchasing power there's
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
kind of purchasing power that's out
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
there and so businesses will still see
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
you know some demand for their you know
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
goods and services they provide so maybe
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the recession that's coming if it does
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
come won't be quite as severe as it
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
might be otherwise so what
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative pled was getting at is
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
once this is gone we don't have that
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
question anymore will we be exposed to
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
more risk at that time I think I think
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's generally right I think it'll
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
bring us back to where we're before the
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic when we didn't have these
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
access savings and so I don't know that
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily kind of a bad place
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
to be but we won't have the cushion
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's that we currently have that might
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
protect us against a little bit of
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
downside risk
 
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
representative legally
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you this might be more of a note
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
to ourselves than a question for the
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
speaker but I'm looking at this chart
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
where it shows our savings going below
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh five percent yes
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and thinking about some of the
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
policies that have pushed these savings
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
up will also be coming to an end at the
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
same time and so I'm wondering if as a
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
policy as a
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a committee it might be really
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
helpful to have someone come who would
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
be able to address federally you know
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
what are those policies that are ending
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
and how does that kind of correspond
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
with these savings
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
coming down I'm thinking as you know a a
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
family of modest means you know how are
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
they going to be set up to face the
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
oncoming challenges of the economy thank
 
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
oncoming challenges of the economy thank
you

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a great idea as I'm
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
looking at all these slides I see that
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
they're dated September in a lot of
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
cases and we have to open up our crystal
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
ball very soon
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and make some decisions that are very
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
important to the state yeah and uh would
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
there be any chance you could update
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
this information for us in the very near
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
future I I this is updated as as much as
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
is possible uh just given but there's
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
going to be a lag with data but if it's
 
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
helpful I I can certainly try and get
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
you the most updated data uh on any any
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
of these data that's that's of interest
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
to you that would be fantastic
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely I see a bunch of hands up
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'll start over here representative
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I just would like a little bit of
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
clarification on some of the definitions
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
that go with this is that percentage is
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
it a percentage of annual income yes
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
disposable income how much of disposable
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
income is going into savings and the one
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
on the right is that the value of all
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
all stocks are all no uh excess savings
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
so the amount of savings that households
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
have accumulated a lot of this isn't
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
bank accounts for example it doesn't
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with that stocks or
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh bonds or anything like that these are
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
how much of the income
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
did we save oh during uh the pandemic so
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
the one on the right is
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you take then what happened on the
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
left you added up everybody's savings
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes okay nothing to do with stocks
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
they're just they're just in bank
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
um sorry I should be careful careful
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
about the stock issue
 
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:55.970 align:start position:0%
about the stock issue
um

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
what's happening is you're taking the
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
data from the left which is and this is
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
saving rate at a point in time how much
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
of income you have uh did you spend and
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
did you spend on you know other payments
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
and how much are you left with
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
and then what's what's being done on the
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
right is just tracking that over time
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
just adding it up over time
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
so I take back my common by stocks
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
people could put that in bank accounts
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
people do different things with it but
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's just tracking how much of the big
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
saving increases during the pandemic
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
have accumulated uh over time that's
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
what's shown on the right so what the
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
left is on at a point in time on the
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
right is is cumulative and nothing to do
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
with what whatever you have invested in
 
00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:39.410 align:start position:0%
with what whatever you have invested in
stocks

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
stocks
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
that's correct the equity price declines
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
that that's not what this is about here
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Lang has a question
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Jason for taking my question
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming I guess my question
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
and if you get into this later that
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's okay just tell me you'll get an
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
answer later but is about debt right so
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
we saw a household debt increase uh nerd
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
wallet I think reported just today that
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
as of September 8 roughly is that
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
household debt increased by over eight
 
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
percent over the previous year and you
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
know a big portion of that was around
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
the Housing Industry right the
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
increasing their debt and housing prices
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
going up and and increased debt load I
 
00:47:16.609 --> 00:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
think we're average household debt is
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
around 165 000 now at this point houses
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
cars and everything else so I guess how
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
does that play and if there's a slide
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
later then I kind of flipped through I
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything on debt a household
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
debt so I was interested in talking
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
about household savings we talk about
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
the other side of the conversation
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
household debt and how that plays into
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
our future
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have that here uh but that's a
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
that's a good question one one thing
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's very much related to that is uh
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
Debt Service uh household's ability to
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
service their debt and that metric
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
looked really good uh recently because
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
interest rates were so low so compared
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
to income which was healthy overall in
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
recent periods
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh interest payments on debt were very
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
low just because the interesting
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
environment was so low uh given monetary
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
policy so they helped a lot but that's
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
changed we're in a totally different
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
rate environment now so that service
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
requirements are rising so the portion
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
of income going to Debt Service the
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
other outlay category here is definitely
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
Rising as well so that's uh that's
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing to keep track
 
00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:16.849 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing to keep track
of

00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay so I see that I've yet yes
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.849 align:start position:0%
okay so I see that I've yet yes
representative

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I actually asked this
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
question two years ago of fed official
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
on and they told me that only once a
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
year I think it was in February they
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
re-analyzed the distribution effect in
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh the savings per household on
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
is that in this um footnote it is yes so
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
the the FED notes a study that I
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
referenced in the in the slide there uh
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
it it does have uh discussion about it
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
devised that the U.S households into
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
four uh quartiles top 25 in terms of
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
income next 25 and and so on and then it
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
it uh shows distribution of how much of
 
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
the excess savings is owned by each of
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
those categories and as as I uh
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier most of this is held
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
by higher income households but some by
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
lower income as well is there some way
 
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:31.190 align:start position:0%
lower income as well is there some way
that

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
that quartiles
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the past three years that they've
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
got I I so I I can certainly I'm looking
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
as this is the uh burden that we're
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to have in uh the social on the
 
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.069 align:start position:0%
going to have in uh the social on the
the

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
lost the word at this point but the um
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
Social Services requirements for the
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
part of our population the lower half of
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
our population that on may not that may
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
have even less savings than they did in
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
19 when
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
hmm as of this last February yeah I'd
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
sort of be glad to kind of forward that
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
study onto onto you I think it's
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
publicly available and and uh I'd be
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so in my remaining 10 minutes here
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try try and see if I can
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
get to kind of the key points uh
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
remaining here but I'm glad for all the
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
engagement here
 
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.690 align:start position:0%
engagement here
um

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
home prices so this obviously is a huge
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
topic it's a huge challenge uh Senator
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
Lang just referenced it as well
 
00:50:42.359 --> 00:50:43.010 align:start position:0%
Lang just referenced it as well
um

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's showing up in inflation home prices
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
are up uh year over year
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
um close to 20 percent
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so uh of course it's going to
 
00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.049 align:start position:0%
and so uh of course it's going to
impact

00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
housing prices and the housing
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
components of CPI as I mentioned earlier
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
the weight placed on housing in CPI is
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
about 30 so what happens to housing
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
really matters
 
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.650 align:start position:0%
really matters
now

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
there's some good news here so
 
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
there's some good news here so
when

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is gets a little bit technical so
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
given the time here I'm going to try and
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
keep this at a very high level and and
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
see if
 
00:51:21.059 --> 00:51:24.290 align:start position:0%
see if
um

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the weight that goes into
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
CPI from housing is for
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
owners of primary residences so
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
two-thirds by homeowners and one-third
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
by renters
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
now so what you need to do is you you
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
know the the economists at the BLS need
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
to track
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
rent payments uh by renters as well as
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
they need to do something complicated to
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
figure out something equivalent to rent
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
for homeowners because homeowners we
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
have mortgage payments but we don't we
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't pay any any rent so how do you
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
take what homeowners pay and then turn
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
that to something that looks a little
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
bit like rent that's a complicated
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
statistical exercise we're going to go
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
into that there but I'll just note that
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty significant lag between
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
the CPI housing metric and what's
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually happening in the in the housing
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
market and that's because
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
renters how often do renters sign their
 
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.809 align:start position:0%
renters how often do renters sign their
leases

00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
leases
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
how often maybe on an annual basis once
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
a year maybe even once every two years
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
so when you survey a given renter at a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
point in time what you're seeing is not
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily today's rent what you might
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
be seeing is rent from a year ago
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
possibly two years ago
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so if newly signed leases are seeing
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
reduced rent you might miss that if you
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
are basing this housing metric on the
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
total Universe of renters which is what
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
the BLS does they want the total
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
Universe of everybody paying rent
 
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
regardless of when they sign their lease
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
and so there's going to be a lack
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
between what's really happening in the
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
housing market rent payments versus this
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
metric that goes into CPI I don't know
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
if that was confusing at all but
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
so so what what do you really want to do
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
is you really want to track what's
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
really happening today because prices of
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
eggs because we go to the grocery store
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
every week to buy eggs you're seeing
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
real-time prices pretty much at any
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
point in time but housing prices we're
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
updating those prices like every year
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
so it's really hard to know kind of
 
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
where you are at a point in time so when
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
you look at uh places like Zillow and
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
and other vendors that provide more
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
real-time data rent is coming down
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
very positive sign because that says
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
that when the officials uh at the Bureau
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
of Labor Statistics update their data
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
eventually it might take a little time
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
maybe up to a year but it'll reflect
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
that reduced rent that's happening right
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
now so that I take to be a very positive
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
sign given the weight on this if that
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
materializes I think that'll be a pretty
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
significant moderating force on
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
inflation going forward we have some
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
questions for you behind you
 
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:16.930 align:start position:0%
questions for you behind you
representative

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the regional
 
00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:22.220 align:start position:0%
nature of the data right if this
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
analysis in General on the Run pressure
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
is based on National or Regional could
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
you comment on the specific New
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Market because my perception
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
is that the most certain factors that
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
limit the inflation in pounding and red
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
rising in New Hampshire being higher
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
than visually I'm wondering what the
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
data shows I don't want to
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
um good question I've only seen National
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
Data on this point on the point of the
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you if you look at New
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
England data so the fhfa tracks New
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
England region and that New England
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
region has seen one of the highest
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
increases in housing prices uh so that
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
it will reflect the National Data in
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
terms of uh rent payments specifically
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
that I haven't seen broken out for for
 
00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:14.089 align:start position:0%
that I haven't seen broken out for for
you

00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:14.099 --> 00:55:24.950 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
I don't have that for you in this slide
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
but that's something that might be
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
available that that yeah okay
 
00:55:31.559 --> 00:55:34.730 align:start position:0%
available that that yeah okay
great

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
okay so in the remaining five minutes
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll try to get to get to the um
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
Outlook so there was an I thought what
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
was an excellent very informative
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
discussion with the labor economists
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
from the state yesterday so I I think
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'll skip the labor market discussion
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
but I'll just I'll just note this when
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
you so what do you think of the Outlook
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
I just gave you on inflation like what
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
what we just spent 45 minutes talking
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
about inflation Outlook what impression
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
are you walking away with I think I've
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
given you
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
generally a positive story that we did
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
see some very sharp rise in in prices of
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
different sectors but things are
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
generally moderating there are some
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
positive developments that we just
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
discussed what is the one area that's a
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
concern and if you ask chair Powell at
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
the fed or others they'll say it's a
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
labor market the labor market is very
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
very tight and they used used words like
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
it's extremely out of balance how many
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
companies are looking for workers the
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
number of job openings are out there the
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
recruiting effort that's out there
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
versus the number of unemployed workers
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
looking for work
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
there are so many more positions open
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
than there are available workers and
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's almost like a structural
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
challenge for the nation I think the the
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
labor Economist yesterday did an
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
excellent job kind of going over that
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
for the state in New Hampshire but as
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
they mentioned it's a national issue
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's the concern yes
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
gas prices are coming down that's great
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
food prices are going to be coming down
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's great housing prices are coming
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
down that's great but if the labor
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
market stays as imbalanced as it is then
 
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:05.180 align:start position:0%
there's going to be pressure on wages
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
and will that lead to companies having
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
to pass on uh costs
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
to consumers in the form of higher
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
prices and will that lead to persistent
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
inflation that's kind of the biggest
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
concern here so I'll just I'll just ask
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
a question of course gentlemen behind
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
when should we get concerned
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
um okay the ratio of national GDP to
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
national debt when should we be
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
concerned okay that's a very interesting
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
question so I think maybe behind that is
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
a concern that you know there could be
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
risk of perception of risk maybe of of
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
the government being unable to meet all
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
their obligations if if a country is
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
issuing too much debt relative to their
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
National output so there have been
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
studies on this and it's it's I don't
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
know that there's a kind of a clear
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
finding on this obviously there's some
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
level there where the level of debt is
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
just unsustainable maybe at a very high
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
level but there are countries out there
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
that have much higher levels of debt to
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
GDP than we do Japan
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh and they've been okay and so uh it's
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
I would say it's a little bit unclear
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
where that kind of threshold is is is
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
there and I think it I think it's a
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
little bit controversial even in
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
academic circles where the United States
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
current levels of debt to GDP uh whether
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
whether that's a too high or too low
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
from a sustainability point of view I
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
think there are varying views on that
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.289 align:start position:0%
think there are varying views on that
point

00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm just talking
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
about employment and and some of the
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about yesterday we
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
heard about yesterday and uh and the
 
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
workforce maybe certain segments of the
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
workforce not fully engaging in in
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
coming back to participation
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
so looking at what you were talking
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
about here with uh
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
the current state of excess savings
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
within the economy and having a burn
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
rate of 100 billion dollars per month
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
anticipating that kind of coming to an
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
end or normalizing at the end of 23.
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
would you is it safe to assume that that
 
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.630 align:start position:0%
would you is it safe to assume that that
might

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:24.140 align:start position:0%
Inspire or motivate or or or
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh get some of those people that are not
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
participating back into the workforce
 
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
what an interesting question that is
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
such an interesting question I had not
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
heard that but that resonates with me as
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
a possible outcome there when people
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
talk about so yesterday the discussion
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
really focused on like how do we get
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
Workers back especially sort of they
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
talked about the bookends the very
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
younger and and the older generation
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
that seem to have reduced their
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
participation in the labor force what
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
can we what can be done about that
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
um usual answers have to do with early
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
retirement covet related concerns
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
immigration maybe a little bit but I
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
haven't heard this specific issue that
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
maybe uh the level of uh excess savings
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
is is a cushion that allows some people
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
to stay out of the labor market but when
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
it does go away will that bring some of
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
the workers back I think it's a
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
fascinating question there may be
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
something to that I haven't seen studies
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
or analyzes of that but it seems to me
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
just as a directionally that might be be
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay we need to wrap this up soon so
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind folks representative
 
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind folks representative
almi

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the things we're
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with is that on the inflation
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
may go down to even two percent but it
 
01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:47.540 align:start position:0%
will go down with a whole lot of people
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
having a lower increase in their wages
 
01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:55.940 align:start position:0%
than they have in their costs
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
which then puts more burden either on
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
the town if the state won't do it
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative there a question here
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
please yes there's a question there so
 
01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.210 align:start position:0%
please yes there's a question there so
the

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:01:10.859 --> 01:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
the question
is

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:18.140 align:start position:0%
how can we try to understand
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
this relationship between are we having
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.410 align:start position:0%
this relationship between are we having
more

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:23.420 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
economically burdened people in New
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that somehow have to be dealt
 
01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
with on
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
and if most of that savings is in the
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
top for 25 percent which is what the
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
economist of the FED two years ago said
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
he thought was true then uh to what
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
extent is there going to be a motivating
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
influence in the bottom 25 percent and
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
the and the bottom half yep so so
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
multiple things there um
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at who has seen the highest
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
wage increases
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
so one very positive development in my
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
mind is that the big rage increases have
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
occurred at the lower end of income
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
distribution it's in it's in the Leisure
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
and hospitality industry uh where the
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
labor shortage is really acute and and
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
they've had to really raise wages lots
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
of we see a lot of minimum wages going
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
up to 15 uh so certainly in
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's really helping a
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
kind of lower income wages
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I know so there's a
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
very important question about when
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
inflation does come down does that also
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
bring down wages and will that hurt kind
 
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
of workers especially kind of the the
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
lower income workers before the pandemic
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh before the pandemic inflation was two
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
or below
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
and wages were going up three percent or
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
a little bit more and I think hopefully
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
what what the FED uh gets us to is the
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
best case scenario here is here is
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
without a recession
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
we have a soft Landing where inflation
 
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:04.940 align:start position:0%
comes back down to around two percent
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then a wage growth similar to
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic maybe three percent or
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
higher and I think if we can get there
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be in a that's that's kind
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
of the ideal best case scenario that I
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:20.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
the budget is Final
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
in June a very practical question
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so timing so
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
timing so the timing of when inflation
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
will come down General expectations so
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
I've provided some outlook here so the
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
fed's expectation is that in 2023
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
inflation will come down a lot but it'll
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
still going to be higher than two
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
percent if so the expectation is that
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
we'll see about a three and a half
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
percent inflation this year and it'll
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
come down to two and a half percent next
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
year where in 20 half percent it's
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
pretty close to their target two percent
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
and if if it's between two and three I
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
think the only people are going to care
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
about econ inflation is going to be
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
economists people like myself and I
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
don't think any of you need to really
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
worry about inflation or other just just
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know average American is not going
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
to care about inflation at that point
 
01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:19.370 align:start position:0%
to care about inflation at that point
um

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the expectation will will we
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
go through a big recession to get there
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
that's the major question
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
all everybody hopes we won't have to and
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
I think because there are some positive
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
Trends I've shown you uh in the in the
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
in this discussion
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I think chances are 50 50. uh whether
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
we see sort of recession to get to that
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
lower inflation or not I think there is
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
a chance and I certainly hope that that
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
materializes that we don't see a big
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
recession to get there if there's a
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
recession it might be a shallow one
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're running a little out of time so
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
because I just want to be respectful to
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
our future speakers uh your presentation
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
has been awesome thank you could you do
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
like a little wrap-up statement or okay
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
great thank you great thank you so I
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
think uh the the quick wrap up is what
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
is going to drive fed policy where
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
interest rates go that's going to drive
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
and what drives fed's policy this year
 
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:16.700 align:start position:0%
is going to be inflation
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
inflation has so many components to it I
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
try to hit kind of the key areas but the
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
but the sector that the FED officials
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
are most focused on is the labor market
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from uh the state
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
economists yesterday the labor market is
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
very tight
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we got to a place where
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
some of the demand comes down so that
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
maybe the job openings the recruiting
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
effort by companies comes down a little
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
without unemployment going up without
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
the economy going into a recession that
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
raises unemployment
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
um uh hopefully we can bring inflation
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
down to kind of where the FED wants it
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
to be over the over the rest of this
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
year and and next year and I think uh
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a chance that might happen but
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
we might see a recession to get there
 
01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.150 align:start position:0%
we might see a recession to get there
but

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
a reasonable guess that'd be my guess is
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
is that if there's a recession it'll be
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
possibly second half of this year uh is
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
is when economists talk about when that
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
might happen
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so much thank you very
 
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.069 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so much thank you very
much

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Ling
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
has a sentence to say so we were talking
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
about housing prices rental prices and
 
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
Zillow was one of the conversations so
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you all look at if you go to an app
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
Zillow has a rental manager you can go
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
look at it and it's free you can take a
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
peek at it and it'll show you if you're
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
given region what rent prices are doing
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
based on current listings whether
 
01:06:50.809 --> 01:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
they're up or down so I just happen to
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
grab Nashua Nash was down but I grabbed
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative always Lebanon lebanon's
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
extremely up so by re it has some
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
Regional rental prices that are real
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
time that you can take a look at if
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to understand what's going
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
on in the economy overall when I look at
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
just the whole state of New Hampshire
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
rental prices month over month are
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
coming down
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
um but still they're still up over a
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
previous from a year ago but on average
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
by 75 bucks but uh month over month
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're slowly starting to come back
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
down so anyway just it's a good resource
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
if you guys want to look at housing
 
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.370 align:start position:0%
if you guys want to look at housing
stuff

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay we'll plan to keep moving and we'll
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
try to take a little bit of a break
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
around 11 o'clock before our final
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
speakers so next up we have the New
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business and industry

challenges and issues and potential
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
solutions that businesses are facing and
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
that helps us develop our our public
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
policy priority document which we use is
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
really our Touchstone guide and all the
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
issues and policy Solutions that were
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking to work with many of you and
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
your colleagues here in the legislature
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
on this is a pretty comprehensive
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
document that touches on a lot of
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
various issues I just wanted to
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
highlight three kind of main core topics
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we continue to hear from our
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
members on that I think will be useful
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
and Mr Skelton do you have copies of
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
that document I do not have copies with
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
you I know one was mailed to every
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
member recently but I will make sure
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we deliver extra copies so you have
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
some here yeah thank you absolutely
 
01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:44.330 align:start position:0%
some here yeah thank you absolutely
um

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
three main topics that fall within this
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
document that I just wanted to touch on
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
that really have been through lines to
 
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:53.780 align:start position:0%
our conversations and our roundtables
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't think they'll necessarily
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
come as a surprise to to anyone uh any
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
one of you and and certainly with your
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
conversations you've had over the last
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
couple days the first is Workforce
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
availability businesses in all sectors
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
continue to struggle to attract and
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
retain the workforce they need there's a
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
lot of variables that that have played
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
into that and in many cases businesses
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
over the last few years have had to
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
change their operations in order to
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate what Workforce they have and
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
what Workforce they can bring in
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
housing a fail availability and
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
affordability is a direct linkage to
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
that Workforce availability issue and
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I can say in in the hundreds of
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had with members
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
across the state when we start talking
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
about their Workforce issues one of the
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
first items they go to is housing and
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're hearing that directly from their
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
employees or the people they're trying
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
to hire as a barrier to attracting and
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
retaining them
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
and then finally cost of energy and and
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
energy the energy Market our Energy
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
Future here in New Hampshire and New
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
England as a manufacturing organization
 
01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:03.140 align:start position:0%
we represent many of our states
 
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:06.380 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are are among our most
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
energy price sensitive businesses and uh
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
also the stability and reliability of
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
that system is extremely important and
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
so there's been a lot of volatility of
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
course over the last few years in that
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
area and so that continues to be a major
 
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.570 align:start position:0%
area and so that continues to be a major
concern

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
so with that kind of high level
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
introduction I want to turn it over to
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
my my colleagues here that have joined
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
me and I'm just going to give a brief
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
introduction then ask them to share a
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
few words about their business and what
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
their experiences have been in the last
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
year and some of their observations for
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
the year ahead and I think it'll give
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
you a window into what many business
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
owners and Business Leaders across the
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
state are are thinking about so I'm

elected when I was five
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
but I knew that it was time for me to go
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
to law school when at one town meeting
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
in Conway just Lyman stood up and
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
figured out my hourly rate at 17 cents
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
an hour and said in a rhetorical
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
question to 2 000 people at Town Hall
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%

Dupree so thank you for your service
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
you're worth every penny and then some
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to you briefly about a couple
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
things first Hospitality just in terms
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
of trying to plan revenues you need to
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
remember even though we've had very
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
robust Roman meals tax collection it's
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
really a tale of two states when covid
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
came North Conway all the tourism
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to get out of Dodge and
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
Roman meals taxes collections there are
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
tremendous but in the business travel
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
Market which is primarily Concord
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua Salem to some degree
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
Keen and to some degree Portsmouth
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
although the presence of the shipyard
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
really distorts that market it has not
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
come back to pre-2019 levels and frankly
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
isn't expected to get to 2019 levels
 
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
isn't expected to get to 2019 levels
until

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
2024 assuming there's no recession I
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
based that on the fact that I subscribed
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
to a lot of econometric models and
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
Marriott and Hilton I'm a franchise you
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
both provide us data what's happened
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
with business travel I can give you a
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
classic case the fellow who organizes
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
the or has the contract to organize the
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
signs on the interstate you know this
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hilton Hotel this exit is from
 
01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.790 align:start position:0%
Hilton Hotel this exit is from
Mississippi

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
Mississippi
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
he used to come once a month pre-covered
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
to meet with his Representatives at
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
D.O.T to make sure everything was going
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
smoothly sell a few more signs now in
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
covety didn't come at all now he comes
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
seven times a year because he doesn't
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
have to leave Jackson Mississippi on a
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
full day to get up here a day of two of
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
work and then a day back so he does six
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
or seven and he does the Rest by Zoom so
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
business travel is forever changed in
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so when you're estimating
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
revenues and I'm sure uh Revenue
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
Administration can help you with that
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
you need to look very careful at don't I
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
would not anticipate any increase in
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
your business travel Market room and
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
meals over what you see this year and
 
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
maybe if there's a recession a slight
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
decrease I do think however that the
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
rates that you're seeing which got much
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
higher in the tourism Market it's a
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
yield management business like airlines
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
are going to have just as good or better
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
year I like to remind my colleagues
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
around the country when I go to a
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
conference that I'd much rather own a
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
Marriott Courtyard or Residence Inn in
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
North Conway than in the middle of
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
Kansas somewhere because so many people
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
can get to us and when there are
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
sessions we see fewer people fly and
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
more people drive to their vacation our
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
challenges are workers like everybody
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
had we applied for the lottery and the
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
H-1B visa when we came we closed the
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
Courtyard by Marriott for 15 months we
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
closed the Fairfield for eight months
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
down at Exit 12 where we have the Hilton
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
true we had that done in January we
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
didn't open it till September because of
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
the coveted restrictions but when we did
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough workers and and we
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't open rooms we'd make sure all
 
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
our rooms were ready for the weekends
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
because that's still our busiest travel
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
time we get tourists coming through
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't want 93 expanded we
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
want them all to stop and have to stay
 
01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:56.900 align:start position:0%
in Concord overnight
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
and literally we couldn't open rooms
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday Wednesday we didn't have
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
enough housekeepers the H-1B visa helped
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
us a great deal the other energy costs
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
are out there housing I'll talk about
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
that in a little bit but the other issue
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're having in the core cities and
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
business travel is security
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
from the homeless and I will give you a
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
case in point this morning before I came
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
over here I got a call from the county
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
attorney that a gentleman who has severe
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and drug issues is being
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
released from the county jail he was
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
declared incompetent to stand trial they
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
gave him medication at the hospital they
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
released him he has three times come to
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Residence Inn because he thinks
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's the center of the oligarchy
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's running the world and taking an
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
ax to our building we have no do not
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
trespass orders so we now pay 250 000 a
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
year for security Personnel at all our
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
hotels headed up by a just retired
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
Sergeant at the state prison that's
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
happening in Manchester it's happening
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
in Nashville it's happening in Salem
 
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
security is a big issue and what that
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
does is that lowers our profit which
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
then reflects we certainly will reflect
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
that in the numbers we give to the city
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
when they assess our property not a
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
direct cost but it's a tangential cost
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the business markets and then just
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
switching to real estate development I
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
will leave with you a little case study
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a pretty simple guy so I I started
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
doing Section 8 housing when it first
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
started sort of like being in the house
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
50 years ago and built a lot of units I
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
still have units in West Stewartstown
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Hooksett Meredith North Conway
 
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.050 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Hooksett Meredith North Conway
Wakefield

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
Wakefield
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
and some other place and
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
the affordability issue there are no
 
01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
easy solutions Mark Twain used to say
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
Everyone likes to complain about the
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
weather but nobody does anything about
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
it and unfortunately that's sort of the
 
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
housing issue but I will leave with you
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I won't go into great detail but I
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
will leave with you an example of what
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of one unit does and what it
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
results in in rent and the bottom line
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
is right now construction costs are
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
ranging between three hundred dollars a
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
square foot and eight hundred dollars a
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars a square foot and
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's that combined with the mortgage
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
rates has slowed down residential
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
construction when I talked to the
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
Architects engineers and I start with
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
surveyors because they get the first
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
call on development they're still busy
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of permitting but a
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
lot of people are holding back and a
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
friend of mine dick antagnos very
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
successful apartment developer just put
 
01:19:25.729 --> 01:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
on hold a 200 unit complex in Lebanon
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which has some of the
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
highest per rents because he can't make
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
the numbers work give him construction
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
costs the bad news is for you folks who
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to solve the housing problem there
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
is no significant
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
diminishment of prices for Commodities
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
building materials or subcontracting the
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
subcontracting by virtue of the fact we
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
don't have enough people in those fields
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
but the materials have not come down and
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you look historically I hate to date
 
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
myself but if you look historically at
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
the 75 to 79 recession the bank failures
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
up here 87 to 89 the 2001 recessions
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
2008 recession prices were going up
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
before they came down a little bit in
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
construction but they never go back to
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
the pre-boost so
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
um uh 300 if you can build a housing
 
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
unit apartment for 300 a foot all in
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
you're doing exceptionally well and I
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't know any developer Kim but I'll
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
pass these around but it gives an
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
example that to build an 800 sorry an
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
850 square foot apartment you need to
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
collect rents of
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
2482 dollars a month or twenty nine
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred eighty four
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and if you have people
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
who make an eighty thousand dollar
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
combined family income at thirty percent
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
they could afford to pay twenty four
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
thousand that's why the only place there
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
are a lot of projects being approved in
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast that's sort of a uh anomaly
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
because that's driven by the very very
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
high median wage created primarily by
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
the shipyard
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
so there are no easy answers density is
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the key ones the Borderland and
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
tax appeal help a lot I hope you'll keep
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that in place but density alone won't
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
solve the problem and short of deep
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
subsidies smaller units
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
quicker ways to permit construction
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
you're not gonna you're really going to
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
be working at the edges on housing I
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
will just add this one last footnote one
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that was added last year
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
was fishing game which is a wonderful
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
organization I'm a sportsman reviews
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
development plans now that has slowed
 
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.750 align:start position:0%
development plans now that has slowed
down

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
pro project processing dramatically and
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
I know they're trying to compensate for
 
01:21:40.689 --> 01:21:40.699 align:start position:0%
it by assigning folks over from
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services but it is a long
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
delay and it adds a delay I'm not
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
commenting on whether it's worthwhile
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Dupree for for presenting I
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm looking for uh you just gave
 
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
the 300 800 square foot costs what was
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
it before I don't have a reference point
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
on that so I'd love um
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
it was about a hundred and forty hundred
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars going into 2019.
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
for those of you who visited or seen the
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
true Hotel I built that in 2019 right
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
before covid for 135 000 a room I just
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
had for the exercise that I knew was
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
coming up had it quoted again today
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's two hundred and five thousand
 
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.530 align:start position:0%
it's two hundred and five thousand
dollars

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
and I go wait a minute the Market's not
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
that good
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and you know wages have gone up so
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
rates have gone up we hire a lot of the
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
new Americans you don't have to speak
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
English you don't have to have a high
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
school education there's some of the
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
best workers we have our part-time
 
01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
people get 15 an hour our full-time
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
people we don't have anybody under 18 an
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
hour and we give full benefits so you
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
can see why that with energy costs why
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
your hotel rooms cost a little bit more
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
and back in the days when I used to
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
offer them to legislators at the Comfort
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
Inn for ten dollars a night we can't do
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
it anymore
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Dupree there's a question behind you
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
learning and planning and what does that
 
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
do to you to the ability to provide
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state there's
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
no question the leader in this effort
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
about 20 years ago I remember the home
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
builders was Humphrey's Architects out
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
of Dallas I remember going to home
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
builders and they said we can do 60 to
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
70 units an acre
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
I go what how could that be but in
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
mixed-use development you can achieve
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
those kind of densities by comparison
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
when I tried to build a 24 unit USDA 515
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
family housing project in Hopkinton 20
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
years ago they changed the zoning and
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
made it four acres per unit so I needed
 
01:23:56.169 --> 01:23:56.179 align:start position:0%
a hundred acres I mean so the land cost
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
your land cost and infrastructure
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't exceed more than 10 to 15
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
percent of your total project costs so
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
when you double and triple density
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're helping you know let's go 20
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
let's say now it's 20 you're helping on
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
the margins that alone isn't enough
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
what's happened in most industrialized
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
countries not that I like to hold up
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
China is a good example of anything but
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
they build buildings much quicker to the
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
same energy code or higher with better
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
earthquake code than we do because they
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
compartmentalize everything so for
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
example in China they build a wall and
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
they put the plumbing and the electric
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
in it it's finished on the inside they
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
put it together and you snap it together
 
01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
like a Lego set our codes don't allow
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
that that's nothing to do in New
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the national fire code
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
the national electrical code where the
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
inspector has to come look at it before
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
the Wall's covered up we are way behind
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
Europe we're way behind Asia and how you
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
build I would love to see New Hampshire
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
become on the Forefront of trying this
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do it and we need to
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
do it if you combine all those things
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
together then you can impact it but
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for this
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
this is an excellent example very simple
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of overlapping our
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and I what I'm seeing is that
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
anecdotally is that the pre-pandemic
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
employee is not the same as the
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic employee 30 hours is the
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
new full-time and that's one of the
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why labor Market's so squished
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if are you seeing the same
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
thing and are you seeing it getting any
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
better as we go forward yes and yes the
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
biggest Exodus was from direct service
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
business you know you can do I have a
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
son who works for a company and he can
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
work from anywhere it's pretty hard to
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
check people into a hotel room or serve
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
a meal or wash a dish so we saw a lot of
 
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:52.100 align:start position:0%
people bail out and find other work
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
that said I will tell you and we're also
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
in Property Management we manage about 3
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
million square feet off of spacing four
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
thousand apartments and Condominiums
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
what we're finding is that in the last
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
three months we're at least getting
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
resumes of good qualified people a year
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
ago we'd post a job for a maintenance
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
technician at 25 an hour maintenance tax
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
engine you don't have to know how to do
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
anything you're not an electrician
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're not a plumber you're not a
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
carpenter you're just a maintenance guy
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we would get no response at twenty
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
five dollars an hour now we're getting
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
some decent candidates so I think it is
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
loosening up a little bit I think people
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
have spent through what they saved
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
you've heard the federal Home Loan Bank
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
show that savings from all the coveted
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
relief that's been spent down and people
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
are back in the market but I think long
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
term people have bailed out of
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
hospitality and the only way we're going
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
to be competitive is we're going to have
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
to overpay to get people to stay in that
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much great next I'd like
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
to introduce uh Brian Murphy he's the
 
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
co-owner of Boyce Highlands here in
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
Concord and Highland hardwoods in

not to beat a dead horse you've heard it
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
from many many people uh
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing is a is a key issue a
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
very big issue one I'd like to at least
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
bring to light today
 
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:49.930 align:start position:0%
bring to light today
um

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:49.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
is attracting people to the trades
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
there has been and continues to be a
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
stigma in this country including the
 
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
state of guidance counselors
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
asking students that if they're going to
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
be successful they need a four-year
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
degree they need to go to college
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the national board
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
of skills USA
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
which is trade schools starting in high
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
school and these young people get
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the trades and with a
 
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
involved in the trades and with a
two-year

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education degree these
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
students can be making anywhere between
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
sixty and ninety thousand dollars a year
 
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
being an electrician a plumber and
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
working in our industry The Woodworking
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
industry and I think that we're doing a
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
disservice putting that stigma on not
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
having a four-year college education
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous workforce out there
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
that they're they're going to college
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
and they're coming out with 100 to 200
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
000 in debt and
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
European or ancient Chinese studies
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
where are they going to get a job that
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
is going to contribute to the economy so
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
Florida has a very good program and I
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
would just like to start to start the
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
process New Hampshire
 
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
combined with the state and private
 
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.490 align:start position:0%
combined with the state and private
businesses

01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
make investments in trade schools in
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
supporting students with incentives to
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
have their education partially or
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
completely subsidized if they remain in
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
this great state and begin their careers
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
the governor talks about people
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
getting their education and then leaving
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
the state this would be a great
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
incentive to stay here there are a
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of job opportunities
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the trades nationally and also here
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
we are down
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
14 employees uh since covid and what has
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
forced us to do is to we've been in the
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
forced automation now we're our third
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
year of a five-year project with that
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
and at the end of that we're going to
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity for Less employees
 
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.350 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity for Less employees
and

01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
Machinery is great but when you have a
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
trained Workforce who cares about what
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
they do it's very important to producing
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
a good product
 
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.890 align:start position:0%
a good product
uh

01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
the skills are aging out and need to be
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
replenished in New Hampshire and across
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
the repercussions from this we're
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
experiencing burnout from employees
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
working 50 60 70 hours a week it not
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
only puts them in danger it puts their
 
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
mental attitude in danger and it and it
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh puts a crimp upon their home life uh
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
being it's very important to be home
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
with their families these people are
 
01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:43.820 align:start position:0%
very dedicated very hard to work
 
01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
they show up early they stay late and
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
they would like to have some people
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
working next to them that they could
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
train so that they could all work
 
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.669 align:start position:0%
train so that they could all work
together

01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:30:52.679 --> 01:30:54.530 align:start position:0%
together
uh

01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
if we ask our customers for longer lead
 
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.610 align:start position:0%
if we ask our customers for longer lead
times

01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
our industry is two weeks or sooner
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're the last trade on the job so to
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
speak at Boyce Highlands we manufacture
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
the finest architectural moldings in the
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
industry right here in Concord New
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our moldings are in the White
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
House they're in the Senate they're in
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
Harvard and Yale and everywhere across
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
where all the moldings downstairs and
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
across the street are and
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
the carpet and the Millwork so we're the
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
last trade everyone else has nine or ten
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
months to get their job done they're all
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
late so we come in and we we have to
 
01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.250 align:start position:0%
late so we come in and we we have to
perform

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
perform
 
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
so if you go out to 8 10 12 weeks then
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
those jobs can be taken offshore they
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
can be done overseas and they come back
 
01:31:41.219 --> 01:31:42.050 align:start position:0%
can be done overseas and they come back
in

01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
so we are all about getting it done
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
perfectly with a highly trained
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce and meeting or exceeding our
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
customers expectations
 
01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.330 align:start position:0%
customers expectations
so

01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
revenues are down because of wage
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
inflation and turnover costs that's
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then the the biggest part I'd just
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
like to say I'm I'm originally from
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
Finger Lakes region of Central New York
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to be a New Hampshire resident
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great state I love the
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
state I love the fact that one voice
 
01:32:15.179 --> 01:32:16.370 align:start position:0%
state I love the fact that one voice
counts

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
counts
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
which today is an opportunity to
 
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
represent that I think we have a very
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
good business atmosphere I'd like to be
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
part of making it better
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips huh thank you
 
01:32:34.139 --> 01:32:34.850 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips huh thank you
um

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about you're
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there should be more
 
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
trade schools I'm wondering where are
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that you're referring to
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
because I live in Grafton County and I'm
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't know of trade schools that
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
are up in there in that area and the
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
second question I have has to do about
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
your Workforce do you train them on the
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
job or what skills do they if not what
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
skills do they need that that's a great
 
01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.250 align:start position:0%
skills do they need that that's a great
question

01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:04.910 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
they need to show up on time and they
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
need to have a great attitude
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's the beginning and we will teach
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
them all the rest
 
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
we have we have uh very
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
very nice German equipment that we have
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
molders we have Sanders we have finish
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and we have so many areas uh
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
Steve mentioned uh
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
maintenance people our maintenance
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
people are the highest paid people in
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
our organization and they are people who
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
have all the skills of the plumbers the
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
electricians and whatnot and they're
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
they keep us they keep us running so as
 
01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
as far as schools uh Pennsylvania has
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
many trade schools and they have
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
specific woodworking trades they have
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
Plumbing trades and these students
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
coming out of skillsusa which is a
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
National Organization of students who
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
work in everything from out outboard
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
motors to Millwork to sewing everything
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
in the world and when you see these
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
students go to a national competition
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
and compete and you see their eyes light
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
up with what the possibilities are
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
because people from industry are there
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
to hire them and put them into trade
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
schools right out of there
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
so uh we recently had uh UNH come and
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
talk to us and they talked about helping
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
the the co-investment and what one of my
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
the trades are much more useful to
 
01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:36.620 align:start position:0%
manufacturing here in New Hampshire than
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh 18th century studies of Europe
 
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
so give give us give us students who
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
have skills that we can put into
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing in this state and it's and
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's a great it could be a great career
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
it could be as little as a two-year
 
01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:51.950 align:start position:0%
it could be as little as a two-year
program

01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
with that comes a lot of infrastructure
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I know that being involved in an
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
organization called architecture
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
woodworking Institute AWI they're a
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
National Organization of accreditation
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
of quality of Millwork standards and you
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
have a whole nation of business owners
 
01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
who are willing to work and step up to
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
the plate to help educate these students
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
in these trades
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
so it's a great opportunity thank you Mr
 
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
Murphy there's a question behind you
 
01:35:35.410 --> 01:35:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
that's a great question three years ago
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
our starting wage was at 14 an hour for
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
an entry entry level position our lowest
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
wage right now is 18 an hour
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
and we have our skilled operators are
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
the number of questions I have
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative leapley next
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um

01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
presentation sheet I'm wondering if um
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
can give us your last names and show
 
01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:15.380 align:start position:0%

Murphy m-u-r-p-h-y
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and just a comment that my
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
doctorate in medieval studies actually
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
makes it so I appreciate fine
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
architecture and um the trades because
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
of course they were using well spoken
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald has a question thank
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
you and let me also offer my art history
 
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:55.189 align:start position:0%
you and let me also offer my art history
degree

01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
as if you if you don't want me properly
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
I said they would they would be
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
applicable in my industry
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
but I would appreciate the architectural
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
molding I have two questions if I could
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally we've heard that along
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
with the wage and burnout problems in
 
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
both hospitality and construction
 
01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.850 align:start position:0%
both hospitality and construction
there's

01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
um the problem of alcohol and substance
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
use disorders and I'm wondering how you
 
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
feel that's impacting your industries if
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
not your particular
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
our particular businesses both at boys
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
Highlands and Highland Hardwoods we've
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
been very fortunate in that we haven't
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
experienced those we have and continue
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
to develop a family atmosphere at our
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
work so it's very open that the person
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
on the floor can come up any their
 
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
manager or anyone above if they have
 
01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
issues we're very involved in in housing
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
if if we have an employee who has a
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
critical housing situation and they need
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
a loan to get into something else we
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
take care of them we realize we want we
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
want to have people for life and then
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
these days that's not something that's
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
usual people come and they go but we're
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to create a skill level and have
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
them feel that they're part of something
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
bigger and that we currently are not
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
experiencing anything that I'm aware of
 
01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:27.860 align:start position:0%
in those issues no but in your industry
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
at large do you hear I would say no
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
because our industry is uh very very
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
technically focused with very expensive
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
woodworking equipment which you can get
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
hurt or killed very easily I mean
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's great uh
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
safety involved in everything that we do
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
so if our all of our managers are very
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
highly trained to detect any type of
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
impairment when the employees come in in
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
the morning and in
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
since I've been here since 2003 we've
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
had one incident in that amount of time
 
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
where someone came in and paired great
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
and Mr Dupree your industry
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
um we we do a bunch of things we have
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory drug testing before you become
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
an employee I will say that we have
 
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
about 300 employees full and part-time
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
and a fair percentage of those our new
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
Americans conquered a resettlement
 
01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
community and I'll be very honest
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
they're some of our best employees and
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
they tend to have fewer of those issues
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
because frankly they're just grateful to
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
be in this country legally and have a
 
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.050 align:start position:0%
be in this country legally and have a
job

01:39:35.050 --> 01:39:35.060 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
what we've found though it started in
 
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
covid uh child care we have a lot of
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
single parents who work for us you know
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
like everyone in New Hampshire and the
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
compounding of having to try and do a
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
job and also be educating your child at
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
home or Child Care lack of child care
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
was a huge huge challenge so what we
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
found overall is that our HR department
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
has had to beef up and we're much more
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
of a wrap around service so we count on
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
all our managers our our groupings are
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
very small like for example at the
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
courtyard I think we have eight
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
housekeepers and there's a housekeeping
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
supervisor that housekeeping supervisor
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
is responsible not only for making sure
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
the job's done but making sure they
 
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on with that in
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
that associate is that associate having
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
a problem with sick child at home that's
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
gotta continue to make so what it's
 
01:40:28.129 --> 01:40:28.139 align:start position:0%
required I think every business has had
 
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:30.659 align:start position:0%
to spend more effort and in our case
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
it's obviously more money and I think
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
true for any size business on HR
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
functions HR has become much more of a
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
taking care of your employee
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
holistically rather than just making
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
sure you're following the wage laws and
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
the i-9s and stuff like that and I don't
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
see that changing frankly the younger
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
employees who come to us now expect that
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
they expect HR to help them with
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
everything and that's that's cool that's
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
fine if that's what we have to do for
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
employees it makes for a better balanced
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
employee we generally because we're not
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
like a fast food restaurant that has
 
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
that really high charge we have the
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
Grappone Conference Center when we're
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
plating 400 dinners as a Hustle but it's
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
not it's not like as difficult as it is
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh as stressful perhaps although my
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen crew would argue and shoot me
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
for saying that
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um as some restaurants so we've been
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
able to have it have we had some people
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
who have come to work impaired yes
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
um we tend to you know we've if we
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
referred some people out who a few
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
people over the last five years who've
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
needed really a strong intervention yes
 
01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
if you create a good workplace culture
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
and people want to work there you tend
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
to attract people who hear about you who
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
know that we're looking out for you and
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
but it takes a lot more effort for every
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
business thank you if I could ask a more
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
general question or follow-up
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
um yesterday we heard that women with
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
younger age children are
 
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
disproportionately staying out of the
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
workforce and that
 
01:42:06.179 --> 01:42:07.090 align:start position:0%
workforce and that
um

01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:07.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
that social assistance
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
category of Labor is is among our
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
highest job loss and I'm just wondering
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
among your members of the Bia how
 
01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
serious a concern is lack of access to
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
available and affordable child care in
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
addition to the wage issue and housing
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
that you've brought up yeah thank you
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
for the the question Senator when I when
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earlier that when I meet
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
with our members across the state or
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
with business owners
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
usually the conversation starts around
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce availability and Workforce
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
challenges and then it goes in one or
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
two directions as the one of the
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
potential root causes of some of the
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
challenges they're facing housing is is
 
01:42:59.209 --> 01:42:59.219 align:start position:0%
usually there Child Care is the next one
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
and it's right there alongside of it
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
increasingly and
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
um it has uh become a a topic of much
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
more frequent conversation in terms of
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
as part of our Workforce Development
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
strategies an area where we need to be
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
thinking what Partnerships can we have
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
with other organizations and how can we
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
work with the legislature on solutions
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
that will strengthen the child care
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
industry that will see more capacity in
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
the child care industry
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I can speak to this myself I have uh
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
I have two children my my youngest is in
 
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
daycare and recently the daycare that
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have a spot in
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
and have our children go through let us
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
know that it for all the families that
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
are in our daycare if you're planning on
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
having giving another child to let them
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
know soon because the waiting time for a
 
01:43:53.770 --> 01:43:53.780 align:start position:0%
new spot was 16 months
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
and that and uh you know that just the
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
for families to have to manage that and
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
to then to your point about ensuring
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
that they can be available in the
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
workforce I think that is a huge part of
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
the labor participation rate changes
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the past few years and
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's both a cost issue and a capacity
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
issue in the child care industry and I
 
01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:18.179 align:start position:0%
know that's a whole other topic we could
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
dig into but there's lots of different
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
entities that are looking at how can we
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
strengthen that industry and I think if
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
we're able to make some positive gains
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
and strengthen that industry our
 
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for the excellent
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
insights into what's happening and
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
your worlds and our world
 
01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.169 align:start position:0%
your worlds and our world
um

01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
this uh paper Mr Dupree it's very useful
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
and helpful
 
01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.370 align:start position:0%
and helpful
um

01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
down two-thirds of the way you talk
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
about high property tax towns and uh it
 
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
looks like there's a premium on the
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
resulting rent that
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
would result in those towns of about 165
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
dollars a month I think what do you mean
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
by high property how do you measure that
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
go into the property tax impact more
 
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.669 align:start position:0%
go into the property tax impact more
broadly

01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
um Concord you know we have in Concord
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of tax-exempt property
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the resulting costs you know our tax
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
burden although Concord does a great job
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
managing that tax burden compared to
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns but we also have an
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
independent school district which sets
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
its own budget independent of the
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
Concord city council so those just get
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's a bill handed in the city and added
 
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:44.900 align:start position:0%
so that's a high tax burden town
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
moultonborough is a low tax burden town
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
because they're fortunate to have a lot
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
of lakefront property at a very high
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
value I mean the rule of thumb generally
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
in apartment
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
nationally if you looked at it it you
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
usually assume your base cost of
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
production it's another 50 percent that
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
can be everything from utilities that
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
you pay for common areas some apartments
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
they actually pay the utilities it can
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
be snow up here and you know Florida
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably greater land care but that
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
40 is actually pretty lean I think most
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
apartment developers in New Hampshire
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
will tell you that they run at a 50
 
01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.669 align:start position:0%
will tell you that they run at a 50
percent

01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
burden over the base cost of the housing
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
for maintenance Property Management
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
leasing all those all those things
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and the 300 a foot is is to be very
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
honest low for new house construction I
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
checked with three builders in this
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
market in the Concord Market because I
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
Was preparing for this they're quoting
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
starter homes what we would call a good
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
basic starter home at five to six
 
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a foot and I can you
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
know I can I can tell you just can
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
commercial construction I just got
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
approved for 25 000 Square foot five
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
story building that when I looked at it
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
pre-covered I had a price quote of 250 a
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
foot and we've been working really hard
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
to get it down to 480 dollars a foot now
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that's you know there's still stuff
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline the surveyors are busy
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
the engineers are busy but they have
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
noticed that in addition to residential
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
construction dropping off interest rates
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
and costs being those two factors that
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
in the commercial construction it's
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
Municipal and governmental and
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
institutional work that's still very
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
busy but they're seeing that start to
 
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
thin out a little bit as all the relief
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
money and and towns have spent that
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
upgrading their schools or their police
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
stations and that you're seeing a lot of
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
commercial construction like I I do for
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
Office Buildings getting priced but
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're putting it on hold because it's
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
just impossible to make the numbers work
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
compared to where they were four years
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
ago so I think even if we don't have a
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
recession just for your planning
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
purposes you're going to see a slow down
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
start to hit obviously it's already
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
starting to hit in the housing market
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
because the interest rates if you're
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
going to start to see a fairly
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
substantial slowdown in commercial
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
construction just because people cannot
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Southwest and
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
questions I want to ask Brian a question
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a great business I was
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
trying to picture maybe you can describe
 
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
it the starting person at 14 an hour are
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
they perhaps either living at home or
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
maybe even still under their parents
 
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
health insurance you know I'm just
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
trying to see with all of our housing
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
that's a great question that puts
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
everything in perspective the answer is
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
yes yeah they're generally a young
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
person who's living at home or have
 
01:48:46.739 --> 01:48:48.050 align:start position:0%
person who's living at home or have
roommates

01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
roommates
 
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:48.770 align:start position:0%
roommates
um

01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
we have had some pretty good success
 
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
people living together in recovery homes
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
and one person comes to work and they
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
show up at work and they say hey this is
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
a pretty nice place to work and then a
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
year later we have four of those folks
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
working with us so yes a lot of a lot of
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
our employees are living at home or
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
their dual income families who are you
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
know the father works the night shift
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the mother works the day shift we
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
run from five in the morning until
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
midnight so they have the availability
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
to work either shift to so that they can
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
work around child care and things of
 
01:49:26.649 --> 01:49:26.659 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah when you you get to 18 an
 
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
hour that is a function of not having
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
people go and and flip Burgers uh as I
 
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
say that's a that's a starting wage yeah
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
at boys Highlands it's even more
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
difficult at Highland Hardwoods because
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're closer to the Seacoast in
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
Brentwood with your your cost of living
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
over there even higher yeah so we have a
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
great Workforce uh right now we are in
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the uh hiring a
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
top-line manager who's going to move
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
from the Catskill region of New York
 
01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.609 align:start position:0%
from the Catskill region of New York
State

01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we're very concerned about finding a
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
place for him and his family to move to
 
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
in that area and have it affordable yeah
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful I think
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
like this chart
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
um that having an idea of what the 14 an
 
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
hour person 18 person looks like is very
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah and they they also see the
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity we do a lot of cross
 
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
training and we give credits and you get
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
an increase in pay every time you
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
cross-train for a different department
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
whether it be the finished apartment the
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
rough Mill the sanding Department the
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mulder department so they they can see a
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
ladder to getting
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
an increase in pay and a better standard
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
of living for themselves that's useful
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Steve I was struck
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
by one of the things that you just said
 
01:50:53.159 --> 01:50:54.590 align:start position:0%
by one of the things that you just said
about

01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.490 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
commercial building seeming to slow down
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
and I wonder
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
given the fact that so many businesses
 
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
were switching to
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
work from home
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
and some of those folks are staying home
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
whether you're seeing that the need for
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
commercial Office Space
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
is going to stay low and how that would
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
affect your job your business yeah it's
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
great to great and cover to be in
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
hospitality and Office Space
 
01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
and not a big great horses huh
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
um business travel Hospitality uh you
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
know we were fortunate concord's a
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of an aberration where state
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
and federal governments are offices tend
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
to be it's very hard for the Bia to be a
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
great government relations function and
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
interface with you by Zoom all the time
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
you all lived through that during covid
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
so concord's a little bit of an outlier
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
that law firms that do anybody who does
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
business with the government's probably
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to still need an office when covet
 
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
started a lot of our tenants and we're
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
the landlord to a lot of the law firms
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
in town said oh we want to give back
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
space but then when they thought about
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
it they said we have more people coming
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
and going but we're probably going to
 
01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
keep the same space and reconfigure it
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
but in terms of new demand you know
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
absent a chub or Lincoln Financial
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
moving back into town you've just not
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
seen those big big users although again
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
aberrations the the two markets that
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
really stand out the Upper Valley
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has started to really
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
capitalize on the the brain power there
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
engineering school Medical school you
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
know and and there's a lot of startup
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that take off and then grow
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
employees and of course I'm the chairman
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the peas Development Authority and I
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
can tell you we're we're filled with the
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
gills over there and trying to find a
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
way to fit more businesses Sig sauers
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
expansion lawns's expansion very high
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
paid jobs but so office space I think
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
over the long term in downtown cities uh
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
is changing uh Shane Brady and Arthur
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
Sullivan who own a lot of buildings in
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester are converting empty floors a
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
thousand Elm Street for those who
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
remember that first they're converting
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
empty floors into Apartments
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
and just a footnote on that because I
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
love studying this five years ago we
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
were 5 000 housing units short today
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
we're theoretically 22 000 housing units
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
short but we haven't seen that much of
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
an increase in household formation what
 
01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.729 align:start position:0%
an increase in household formation what
gives

01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
gives
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm not saying this because I'm in
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
the hotel business and I have any ax to
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
grind with third-party rentals like
 
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
Airbnb I've used them but I think what I
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
know what's happened in Mount Washington
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
Valley is you're much better off to rent
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
your condo for one weekend a month at a
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
nice high rent rather than letting a
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
tenant take it for a year and that you
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
know again I'm not saying it's bad it's
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
create a lot of wealth for people who
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
engage in that it's been great to help a
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
lot of people but that has taken a huge
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
number of available rental units in my
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
opinion out of the market
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
we have we're a little short on time but
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
we have a bunch of hands up so we're
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to start with representative
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
palette and go to representative orrs
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr Dupree you uh caught my
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
attention I'm going to ask a 500 a foot
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
for construction does that apply to all
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of construction housing or a
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
commercial what that's housing right now
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
well it's 500 a foot if those numbers
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
are fantastic because you have a 16 100
 
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
modest home foot a lot of some that's
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
800 Grand that's and literally that's
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
why the trading market and Commercial
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
properties people are bidding up prices
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
like right now the hotel business isn't
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
great but we're seeing and interest
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
rates are high but we get we get
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
unsolicited offers all the time at
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
record high rates because they figured
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
out you can't replicate it for what you
 
01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:39.530 align:start position:0%
out you can't replicate it for what you
can

01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
own it
 
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:44.060 align:start position:0%
um and commercial construction
 
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know I I looked at the numbers for
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack County Courthouse that we
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
did what seven years ago and we were 300
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
a foot that would be a thousand dollars
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
a foot now for an Institutional quality
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
building can't stay there I know and you
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
know it will come down somewhat that's
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
why if you look at the home builders
 
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
looks at every every recession we've had
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
it brings stuff down some level but it
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
never goes back and I'll give you this
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
example I tracked two by four prices in
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
in in February of 2020 before covid a
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
ten foot two by four was three dollars
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
when covet hit in the summer of 20 it
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
went to 11 dollars
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 21 it dropped down to
 
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
450 and everybody thought we were
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
getting a bargain it was a 50 increase
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
but we wanted all you could get and then
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the fall of 21 it bounced up to ten
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and I haven't dared looks since
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
then but it's never going back to three
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
is it going to be 450 or 5 but even if
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's 4.50 that's a 50 increase in your
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
framing most Builders now who are doing
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
home building and even construct
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
commercial construction like I'm fitting
 
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
up a building for the Department of
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
Justice they'll only give you a quote 20
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
to 30 days in advance of when they start
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
because they can't take the small
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
Builders particularly can't take that
 
01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so earlier you
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned you screen individuals for
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
drugs and that kind of thing so how's
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
that impacting your business and what is
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
the percentage that pass I have a friend
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
that hires in Pennsylvania
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
and he was telling me it takes 20 people
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
to hire two so he's got about a 90
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
rejection rate and I'm just curious if
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's still true or what you're
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
experiencing here in New Hampshire
 
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's a lot less I mean we
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
um we're not nearly that high because we
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
tell people when they apply for a job
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
they have to take a drug test so a lot
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
of people self-screen out and you know
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
to be honest we I mean we used to have a
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
policy that if you had any felony
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
conviction at any time in your life you
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
were not eligible for employment with us
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
but we've looked at some I'll say we've
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
made exceptions where somebody was
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
convicted of marijuana possession at a
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
felony level 17 years ago and they've
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
never had another offense great we'll
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
give that person a shot but it's not
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
nearly that high I you know again we're
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
probably biased because people
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
self-select and go I'm not going to
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
apply but the other thing that's amazing
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
though there are people who do apply and
 
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
take the drug test and fail a drug test
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
knowing you're going to take one I'm
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
going they they didn't we didn't not
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
hire him because of the drug test we
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question and
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
then we'll look for like a closing
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
statement from you Michael thank you
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
thanks uh staying with the workforce
 
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
again on we
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have had a problem in a number of our
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
schools including in Lebanon that the
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
school is oriented entirely towards
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
College as you started out saying at the
 
01:57:56.410 --> 01:57:56.420 align:start position:0%
beginning on
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
have on and what happens is that a lot
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
of kids who feel like they don't want to
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
do college and that kind of career on
 
01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
they drop out mentally very early in the
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
school process and they start doing
 
01:58:12.599 --> 01:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
school process and they start doing
drugs

01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
we had one of the first heroin crises in
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think in our area does
 
01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
the member have a question please the
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
question is is this uh are you having
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
any more success than you've had in the
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
past with breaking through to school
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
boards and school superintendents
 
01:58:39.729 --> 01:58:39.739 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
their understanding that there are
 
01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
productive careers for people that are
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
not going through college that's a
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question uh I as I've
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
recently become involved with the MEP
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
which I find is a great organization in
 
01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
this state and getting involved with 8th
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
and ninth graders getting them all early
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
7th 8th and ninth graders it's almost
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
too late when they're seniors because
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
you they do tend to drop out
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
and we are going to take part in a
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
program that they have every year of
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
bringing the students to manufacturing
 
01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
facilities throughout the state
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
I personally am very open to anyone that
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
I could get in front of to talk about
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunities in the trades to the
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors are doing what they
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
were taught to do but there are
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of students being left behind
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
and these students you know you you take
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
a farm kid who's got a good work ethic
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
and they have more skills and a lot of
 
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
people coming in the door and those are
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
the type of people we'd like to to take
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
and train and work with but getting
 
01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:49.340 align:start position:0%
trade organizations to do that
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
would be a fantastic way to grow
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:59:57.649 --> 01:59:57.659 align:start position:0%
I'll just add one quick addendum to that
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
um and this may be something that the
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
legislature can think about and and help
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
with I think our challenge
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
um with Business Partnership with our
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
Public Schools is how to scale it we
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
have lots of school districts in New
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they all work
 
02:00:13.619 --> 02:00:16.370 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they all work
independently

02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
independently
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
there has to be more ways that when
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking for business Partnerships
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
we can do it at scale with many of them
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
at once rather than individually having
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
to work with each individual School each
 
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
individual District going to each school
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
board that becomes simply too much for
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
our business organizations and
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
businesses who don't have the time and
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to do that there's
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
a willingness to partner but we have to
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
find a way to scale it up at a higher
 
02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
find a way to scale it up at a higher
level

02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of great information here we're
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to wrap it up I think
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:51.589 align:start position:0%

02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
if you have any information that you'd
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
like to submit to us it would be great
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
because we've been taking copious notes
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
but if you have more that you want to
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
share with us we would probably really
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that as we look for our
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates thank you very much if
 
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:08.820 align:start position:0%

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
I could just add one closing comment to
um

02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's always a treat for me when I'm able
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
to bring members to settings like this
 
02:01:15.169 --> 02:01:15.179 align:start position:0%
because you can see the wealth of
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
knowledge they bring and I would just
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
leave this as an open invitation that at
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
any time during the legislative session
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
if the Bia can be a resource and
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
bringing members from various industry
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
sectors to come and give you a
 
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:29.460 align:start position:0%

good morning my name is Ben Cushing and
 
02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
I reside in New London and do work in
 
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley I'm licensed as a
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
realtor both in New Hampshire and in
 
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
Vermont and basically practice real
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
estate in the Lake Sunapee region of New
 
02:12:11.219 --> 02:12:12.109 align:start position:0%
estate in the Lake Sunapee region of New
Hampshire

02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know as a realtor we've had a pretty
 
02:12:17.649 --> 02:12:17.659 align:start position:0%
good ride in the last couple of years
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
sales have been rather brisk and we have
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
done very well we've had records not
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
only from my company but we've had
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
record sales in the state of New
 
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however there's a little bit
 
02:12:34.570 --> 02:12:34.580 align:start position:0%
of a different feel in the air right now
 
02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
that things might be changing and I'm
 
02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
sure that's part of the reason why we
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
might be here chatting with everybody
 
02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:44.099 align:start position:0%
today that some of us feel that same way
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
I know in my company we're feeling that
 
02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at different things
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
that might be happening even though
 
02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
we've started the year off with some
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
really big sales high dollar sales uh in
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley region at least that
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
have been happening
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
so you know what's what has gone on in
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
the last few years has been uh very
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
interesting in that you know my my 25 26
 
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
years in real estate
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the average days on Market
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
when I was uh a 10-year veteran uh in
 
02:13:19.609 --> 02:13:19.619 align:start position:0%
the New London area was about 150 days
 
02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
the average days on market for a home we
 
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
thought that was really good
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
if a house is on the market for more
 
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
than 15 minutes today we joke that
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
um uh and as you see on the sheet that
 
02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bob I believe had handed out to
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
everybody the average days on Market at
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
least for the uh end of 2022 was 23 days
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
so home was on the residential home was
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
on the market
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
um that is a record for us here in the
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
state as is the median uh Statewide home
 
02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
state as is the median uh Statewide home
value

02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the problem that
 
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're running into
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
I have many buyers that I'm working with
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
that would like to move into the Lake
 
02:14:03.169 --> 02:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
Sunapee region predominantly New London
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
where I live and an entry level home to
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
get you into the town in London today is
 
02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
about five hundred thousand dollars
 
02:14:11.169 --> 02:14:11.179 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
 
02:14:13.729 --> 02:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
whereas ten years ago that same home
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
would have been 250 300 000 dollars
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a it's a problem that we
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
face and I'm you know we don't have all
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
the answers
 
02:14:25.250 --> 02:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we're not economists sitting here
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
even though Chris likes to think he's an
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
economist uh because he deals with
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
commercial all the time
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
um but we're not economists and and as
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
Bob and Chris will talk today we do have
 
02:14:38.569 --> 02:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
some information from our chief
 
02:14:40.729 --> 02:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
Economist at the National Association of
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
Realtors Dr Lawrence Yoon who we all uh
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
look at everything he mentions and and
 
02:14:49.729 --> 02:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
use some of that
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
um you know entry-level values in the
 
02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
500 000 range hurt a lot of people
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know that young couple that wants to
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
move to New New Hampshire New London
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
area it's hard for them to get in New
 
02:15:05.569 --> 02:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a very desirable state
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know when the pandemic started to
 
02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
happen we uh I saw many many young
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
people and younger than I moving in from
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
the cities wanting to move to the
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
country but that's New Hampshire the
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
country and they had plenty of money and
 
02:15:25.729 --> 02:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
they were paying cash six seven eight
 
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in cash to buy
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
a home because like they can now work
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
out of their house
 
02:15:34.209 --> 02:15:34.219 align:start position:0%
and we're still seeing that happen
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
however one of the things that I was
 
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
talking with Bob out in the hallway
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
before we came in that I've always said
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
throughout my career is if I see new
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
construction happening new residential
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
construction that's what I I'm referring
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
to residential Crystal speak to
 
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
commercial if I see new residential
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
construction happening throughout the
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
state I think things are moving in the
 
02:15:57.169 --> 02:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
right direction I'm not seeing a lot of
 
02:15:57.179 --> 02:15:58.189 align:start position:0%
right direction I'm not seeing a lot of
that

02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
I recently had a client that bought land
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
in Newbury New Hampshire on a very nice
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
property that overlooked Lake Sunapee an
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
expensive piece of land
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
but wanted to build they're not from
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
here they bought the land they met with
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
some Builders and found out the average
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
cost to build a nice home in that area
 
02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
was four to five hundred dollars a
 
02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
you can do the math and figure out what
 
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost you to build a 2 000
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
square foot house
 
02:16:28.129 --> 02:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
he ended up finding a builder from
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that was willing to come
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
up here and build that for half the cost
 
02:16:35.089 --> 02:16:35.099 align:start position:0%
um so those are some of the other things
 
02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
that you know we're facing
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
um the other issue being in the Upper
 
02:16:40.139 --> 02:16:40.990 align:start position:0%
um the other issue being in the Upper
Valley

02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
Valley
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of nurses and doctors
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
that go to Dartmouth
 
02:16:46.439 --> 02:16:47.330 align:start position:0%
that go to Dartmouth
um

02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
we have many stories from clients agents
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
of mine rather that have clients that
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
can accept jobs at Dartmouth high paying
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
jobs at Dartmouth but they can't find a
 
02:17:00.889 --> 02:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
place to live and or they're living an
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
hour hour and a half away and accepting
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
that job so those are some of the real
 
02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
issues that we are up against in real
 
02:17:09.849 --> 02:17:09.859 align:start position:0%
estate today
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that this is no
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
secret is inventory you all have heard
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
it you've heard it nationally it's the
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
same here in New Hampshire we have one
 
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
of the lowest if not the lowest amount
 
02:17:25.730 --> 02:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
of inventory right now I think we're
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
just over 1500 residential homes for
 
02:17:31.969 --> 02:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
sale at the end of 2022 in the state of
 
02:17:32.929 --> 02:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
now if you go back and I'm sure I don't
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
know if this is on a slide if they have
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
it in their packet I think it's in their
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
packet isn't it that 20 uh 2000 and 2015
 
02:17:44.219 --> 02:17:45.530 align:start position:0%
packet isn't it that 20 uh 2000 and 2015
maybe

02:17:45.530 --> 02:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
um we had 15
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
000 residential homes for sale at the
 
02:17:52.929 --> 02:17:52.939 align:start position:0%
end of December in 2015 and here we are
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
2022 we have just over 1500 that's not a
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
lot to choose from even though we've
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
seen home values go through the roof
 
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's pure supply and demand so we are
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
working on this on a daily basis trying
 
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with ways as to how we can
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
generate more listings you know it's
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
very hard if I said to each and every
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
one of you I could sell your house today
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and make you
 
02:18:22.009 --> 02:18:22.019 align:start position:0%
um five hundred thousand dollars profit
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
you'd all be very excited I know Tom
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
would be because Tom Tom and I are
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
neighbors down in New London and
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
Wilmette but but Tom would say to me
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
geez Ben that sounds great right but
 
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
where am I I going to go if you're going
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
to stay in the New London Wilmette area
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay for that on the
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
other end so why would you sell
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
or you move in with Ben yep you have to
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
deal with my wife so go for that
 
02:18:48.129 --> 02:18:48.139 align:start position:0%
um uh you know right
 
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you knew my wife you wouldn't do that
 
02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:53.450 align:start position:0%
if you knew my wife you wouldn't do that
um

02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
um uh so so that is one of the other
 
02:18:58.250 --> 02:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's one of the other issues you know
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
we are facing is a lot of sellers are
 
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
saying we don't want to sell right now
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
because where we're going to go unless
 
02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
they're moving out of state right so
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
those are some of the issues that we are
 
02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:08.089 align:start position:0%
those are some of the issues that we are
facing

02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
facing
 
02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
um you know real estate has been a has
 
02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
been a great career for me I've
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
thoroughly enjoyed it I love working
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
with buyers and sellers
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm a native of New London and New
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire obviously I love selling New
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to people it's a wonderful
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
state to live in I'm very proud to raise
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
our Amy and I raise our two sons and my
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
folks live in Wilmot uh near near Tom
 
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a great area it's it's
 
02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
just very frustrating when people want
 
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
to come to our area and we can't find
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
them anything to uh to buy even if they
 
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
have a lot of money so it's it's very
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
very tough so with that I'm going to
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Bob and he'll start or
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether I don't know Barbara Chris and
 
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
he'll start his
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation to give you some
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
more statistics so thank you very much
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%

quick question before we move on awesome
 
02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.090 align:start position:0%
quick question before we move on awesome
representative

02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:06.770 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this was just a a
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
talking point but it you you mentioned
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
now 400 to 500 dollars per square foot
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
to build which you know we've been
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and you gave an example of a
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
young couple I think that that wanted to
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
build and found that high and then found
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
a builder and Mass to do build it for
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
half the price how how is that possible
 
02:20:26.399 --> 02:20:27.469 align:start position:0%
half the price how how is that possible
labor

02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
labor
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah they didn't charge as much in labor
 
02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
costs you know we've seen Lumber
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
materials come down a little bit
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
um but that with a apparently they they
 
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
knew this person as well so they gave
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
them a better deal on the labor is where
 
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
it really turned out to be you know and
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
I talk about that four or five hundred
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar square foot home we've
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
had a lot of builders in the Lake
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
Sunapee region that have had it really
 
02:20:50.929 --> 02:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
good for a long period of time and they
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
built some places on the lake that they
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
were able to bring those prices up and
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's an unfortunate thing that it's
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
no longer 75 dollars a square foot I was
 
02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
hoping that was some sort of repeatable
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
thing right right I don't have though I
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't think so but thank you
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%

02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go through some of the
 
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
statistics and put some of the data into
 
02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
into context
 
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I think we've all heard and seen in
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the media notion that real estate both
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and nationally is
 
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
cooling off a bit and this may not be
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the best analogy to make today but it's
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
sort of like saying yesterday was 105
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
degrees out and now it's 95 degrees out
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
so it's cooler yes it is but you got to
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
put it in context it's still a red hot
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
market so the first if I can do this
 
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.389 align:start position:0%
market so the first if I can do this
correctly

02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um slide I'll share with you is um
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire affordability index so
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
this is something that we put together
 
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
to sort of give uh folks a sense of
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
how much home can a typical New
 
02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
how much home can a typical New
Hampshire

02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um uh citizen afford
 
02:22:06.889 --> 02:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
and so again it's uh so if you had an
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
index here of 120 that means a median
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
household income is 120 percent of what
 
02:22:15.889 --> 02:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
it would necessary to qualify for the
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
median price home under prevailing
 
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
interest rates so the higher the index
 
02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
the more affordable
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
we are clearly now at the lowest we've
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
ever seen and that has been the case
 
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so we're down to 73
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
percent right now so that means income
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
is only 73 percent of what is needed uh
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the median price home so a lot of
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
prop a lot of buyers simply are not
 
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
going to be able to afford properties in
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
and I also want to point out that you'll
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
notice this chart starts in 2005. so
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
this lack of affordability this slow
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
decline started about a decade ago yes
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
there was sort of an accelerant uh
 
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
earlier this year as interest rates
 
02:23:08.330 --> 02:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
increase our and leading to higher
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates and that has certainly
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
been a contributing factor but it's
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
probably not the only Factor as well to
 
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
so other contributor obviously to
 
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
so other contributor obviously to
um

02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
affordability as a part to interest
 
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
rates is the median sale price again
 
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
same sort of and you'll kind of see a
 
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
theme here uh over the past 10 years
 
02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
there has been a slow steady Inc
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
increase in uh median sale price
 
02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:39.410 align:start position:0%
increase in uh median sale price
starting

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
starting
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
just after the recession about 2012 and
 
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
keep in mind for
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
eight years prior to the pandemic
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates were pretty consistent
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know say three and a half percent
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
plus or minus a little bit but even with
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
that sort of consistency and interest
 
02:23:58.690 --> 02:23:58.700 align:start position:0%
rates you did see
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
both median sale price increase
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
the next slide is the volume of closed
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
sales so this is probably one that's
 
02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
most interesting if you're interested in
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax so this is
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
total value of all property uh and the
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
yellow line is single family homes the
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
blue line is condo sales now keep in
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
mind Chris is going to talk about
 
02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial contributes a
 
02:24:29.690 --> 02:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
great deal to the real estate transfer
 
02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
tax as well
 
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
so one thing I point out here is
 
02:24:40.610 --> 02:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
throughout 2022 you saw on a
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
month-to-month basis so we always
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
compare January of 22 to January of 21.
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
you don't want to go January of 22
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
comparing to February 22 because as you
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
can see with
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
um their seasonality to real estate uh
 
02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh there's more likely to see a greater
 
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
number of sales in the spring and summer
 
02:25:03.650 --> 02:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
winter time people aren't as interested
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
so those decrease and that's consistent
 
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
year in and year out
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the past three months you will notice
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
that the total
 
02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
volume of sales has declined so October
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
was down 10 percent November is down
 
02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
about 17 percent December significant
 
02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:22.700 align:start position:0%
decrease down to 25 percent
 
02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
and you will notice that in all of these
 
02:25:26.929 --> 02:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
charts the past three months there's
 
02:25:29.150 --> 02:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
been something that's a little bit
 
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
different from the previous months in
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
2022 whether or not the long-term Trend
 
02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
or not I don't know but clearly
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
something is is is happening undoubtedly
 
02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
related to the the interest rates in the
 
02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:45.349 align:start position:0%
related to the the interest rates in the
economy

02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
closed sales
 
02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
so a factor in terms of total volume yes
 
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
median sale prices are increasing but
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see here that closed sales are
 
02:26:00.530 --> 02:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
dropping we saw throughout much of again
 
02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
post recessionary period year in year
 
02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
out increases in closed sales I will
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
point out that in 2020
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
the pandemic year it was a record number
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
of closed sales in the state of New
 
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at 18 474 single-family homes
 
02:26:21.889 --> 02:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
this past year in 2022 we were down to
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
um closed sale since 2014 in New
 
02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
um closed sale since 2014 in New
Hampshire

02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
so there was a significant drop during
 
02:26:37.969 --> 02:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:40.790 align:start position:0%
question is
um

02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:42.650 --> 02:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
how much demand is there still out there
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
for housing we see prices increasing
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates increasing is there's
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
still a market out there well Ben
 
02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
alluded to it during the pandemic in
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
2021 it was not unusual for an open
 
02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.849 align:start position:0%
2021 it was not unusual for an open
house

02:26:57.849 --> 02:26:57.859 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
to see 50 60 70 people walk through that
 
02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
house in the first day enormous amount
 
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
of penned up demand does that still
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
exist so this I think is one chart that
 
02:27:11.530 --> 02:27:11.540 align:start position:0%
gets at that which is days on the market
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
so this is from the time house goes on
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
the market until you not the closing
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
date but uh when you when the property
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's an offer on the property that's
 
02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:24.110 align:start position:0%
there's an offer on the property that's
accepted

02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
so you can see again same Trend past 10
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
years that's been declining consistently
 
02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
all right and now we're down to in
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
December it was 32 days
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
but this past summer it was as low as 13
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
days again sort of record numbers of low
 
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:46.220 align:start position:0%
um so there's still
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
as as Ben mentioned earlier it was not
 
02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:51.410 align:start position:0%
as as Ben mentioned earlier it was not
unusual

02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
um to see
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
this number being
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
90 days 100 days so there's still an
 
02:27:59.690 --> 02:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of demand out there
 
02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
something goes on the market it goes
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
maybe not quite as quick as it did in
 
02:28:08.510 --> 02:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think the other factor in all of this
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
again same Trend past 10 years steady
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
decline fewer and fewer homes are going
 
02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
on the market
 
02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.610 align:start position:0%
on the market
and

02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
we have seen that that really bought
 
02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
started to bottom out during the
 
02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:32.150 align:start position:0%
started to bottom out during the
pandemic

02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and we've kind of been bouncing
 
02:28:37.690 --> 02:28:37.700 align:start position:0%
in the past two years still
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
historically low levels of inventory
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
both in the single family home Market as
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
well as in the condo Market
 
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
some of it certainly is going to be
 
02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
attributed to the fact that
 
02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
individuals Property Owners may not want
 
02:28:53.809 --> 02:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
to put their homes on the market right
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
now because they have locked in an
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
interest rate at three percent so if
 
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
they sold their home yes they're going
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
to reap benefits larger equity in the
 
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
home but they're also now going to be
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
potentially paying an interest rate
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's twice as much
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's currently but you can see
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
previous to the pandemic the trend was
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
still occurring that we were seeing
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer homes in New Hampshire
 
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
and inventory is a real problem
 
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
same thing argument months of Supply so
 
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
this chart shows if everything that's on
 
02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
the market right now nothing else came
 
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
on the market everything that's on the
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
market right now would a sell how long
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
would it take to sell all of that
 
02:29:34.319 --> 02:29:35.270 align:start position:0%
would it take to sell all of that
inventory

02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
so we're down to about a month's worth
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
of inventory a healthy Market not an
 
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
economist but all economists will tell
 
02:29:43.370 --> 02:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
you this it should be between four and
 
02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
six months all right so we are well
 
02:29:47.809 --> 02:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
below that uh the past couple of years
 
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
we have hit certain months where we had
 
02:29:51.969 --> 02:29:51.979 align:start position:0%
just three weeks of inventory
 
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
and that leads to the fact that days in
 
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
the markets declining demand is there
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
they just aren't enough homes available
 
02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
um this chart is just to give you a
 
02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
sense of what's happened the past year
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
so if you look at it uh in January
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
um median sale price was about 14 higher
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh than it was in January of 2021 so you
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
can kind of see
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
um month to month in 2022. so the idea
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
here is
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
median sale price each month is still
 
02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
median sale price each month is still
increasing

02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's just increasing at a slower rate
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
and the question would be are we going
 
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
to get down to that number being zero uh
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
next slide is mislabeled so I'll skip
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
over it's it this is really about just
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the past 10 years
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
um a lot of equity has been created in
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
homes uh and 2022
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
what we saw in terms of again
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
seasonality uh is very similar to
 
02:30:57.730 --> 02:30:57.740 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic years
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 we saw these wild
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuations we don't see them uh
 
02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:06.410 align:start position:0%
fluctuations we don't see them uh
now

02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'll also bring up the fact that if
 
02:31:10.849 --> 02:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
you're interested uh in sort of diving
 
02:31:10.859 --> 02:31:11.650 align:start position:0%
you're interested uh in sort of diving
into

02:31:11.650 --> 02:31:11.660 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
your own communities statistics we have
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
that available on our website nhar.org
 
02:31:21.050 --> 02:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
nhr.com also works if you go to the site
 
02:31:23.090 --> 02:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's called Fast stats and you can kind
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
of bore down so I
 
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
randomly chose Bedford as an example
 
02:31:30.969 --> 02:31:30.979 align:start position:0%
and you can see
 
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
how the sale price has changed
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout the past
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
decade or so and some additional
 
02:31:41.809 --> 02:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
information and I also randomly chose oh
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
let's guess it's not there that's okay
 
02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and also randomly chose Laconia to
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
show you as well so
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you can see that it'll give you a
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
sense of median sale price how long
 
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
something's staying on the market
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
Etc so this is available for most
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
communities in in the state of New
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can always check on it
 
02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:02.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can always check on it
um

02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:05.389 --> 02:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in boring down into
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
um deeper data on your community feel
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
free to contact myself
 
02:32:13.790 --> 02:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
and we have access to that information
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:32:18.889 --> 02:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
so I guess summarize sort of what we're
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
trying to say here is that
 
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:21.730 align:start position:0%
trying to say here is that
um

02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:21.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
and you heard I think previously the
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
difficulty in finding workers we believe
 
02:32:27.889 --> 02:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
is tied directly to the lack of housing
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
options and I think we just demonstrate
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
that how the lack of inventory and
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
housing options for workers exists and
 
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
that that's a restraint on New
 
02:32:40.610 --> 02:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy we need to work
 
02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
together to try and find Solutions
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to turn it back over to
 
02:32:47.809 --> 02:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
Ben and Ben can talk a little bit about
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh what he sees happening
 
02:32:50.399 --> 02:32:51.170 align:start position:0%
uh what he sees happening
um

02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
moving forward he's going to play may we
 
02:32:55.610 --> 02:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
interject I see a bunch of hands flying
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
maybe this is going to be addressed but
 
02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:03.410 align:start position:0%
maybe this is going to be addressed but
uh

02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you're seeing any uh
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
a change in who's buying
 
02:33:12.770 --> 02:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
the stock particularly interested in
 
02:33:15.130 --> 02:33:15.140 align:start position:0%
investors who may be
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
essentially converting
 
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
housing to short-term rental
 
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:23.270 align:start position:0%
housing to short-term rental
use

02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.969 --> 02:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
and all that Bob and Chris speak to this
 
02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
as well you know for me personally in
 
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
the segments of the state that I work in
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
I have not seen a lot of investors
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um buying single-family homes
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a ton of apartment buildings
 
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
in the Upper Valley or excuse me Lake
 
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
Sunapee region Upper Valley has a little
 
02:33:47.929 --> 02:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
bit more but we haven't been seeing them
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
Changing Hands much so I don't see a lot
 
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
of investors doing that in at least in
 
02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
my segments I don't know what these two
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to get you some data actually
 
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
the National Association of Realtors
 
02:33:58.849 --> 02:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
recently just did a national a
 
02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
nationwide study on this and they looked
 
02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
at it from every state
 
02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough New Hampshire
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
ranked 50th in terms of investor buyers
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
into the into the into the state the
 
02:34:09.889 --> 02:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
reason for that is a lot of the
 
02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
investors uh that and I'm not just
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
talking about short-term rentals I'm
 
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
just talking about larger investors I
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
mean they're buying in areas like Texas
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
and Florida Utah areas where you can go
 
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
in and what they're generally doing is
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
they're finding neighborhoods that still
 
02:34:24.889 --> 02:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
exist where sort of depressed pricing
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
they see an opportunity so they buy a
 
02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:27.650 align:start position:0%
they see an opportunity so they buy a
lower

02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
value homes they fix them up and then
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
they rent them out at a profit those
 
02:34:33.770 --> 02:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
opportunities are not really going to
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
exist in New Hampshire for that type of
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
investment property in terms of
 
02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
specifics on short-term rentals happy to
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
try and get you more data on that if you
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
want to dig into it there is a really
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
good uh Source called air it's not BNB
 
02:34:49.550 --> 02:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's called air DNA and they track
 
02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:50.929 align:start position:0%
it's called air DNA and they track
nationally

02:34:50.929 --> 02:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
02:34:50.939 --> 02:34:51.650 align:start position:0%
nationally
um

02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
how many people are utilizing their
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
properties for single for short-term
 
02:34:58.849 --> 02:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
rentals and so you can kind of you're
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to see that I will say that over
 
02:35:04.010 --> 02:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
the past three years it has increased
 
02:35:05.290 --> 02:35:05.300 align:start position:0%
the number
 
02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a percentage for you
 
02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge increase but again
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's going to be somewhat dependent
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
upon your community
 
02:35:16.849 --> 02:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
Senator Lane
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
question so my question is around
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
um so again it seems like we're talking
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
about affordable housing earlier and
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is defined by the
 
02:35:29.090 --> 02:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
cost of the house the interest rate and
 
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
the wage right those are the three
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
components as you figure out what the
 
02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
index looks like and so obviously we see
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
the velocity of home prices in New
 
02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what it's doing and we've
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
seen what happened with interest rates
 
02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's now causing a real bottleneck and
 
02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
we're seeing you know again it was we
 
02:35:46.849 --> 02:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
talked about the slowdown in sales
 
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
happening because no one wants to give
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
up a four percent interest rate for a
 
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent interest rate
 
02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent interest rate
um

02:35:53.330 --> 02:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:54.770 --> 02:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
what's going to change what's that
 
02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
looking like what do you guys see or
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
what's your crystal ball thinking about
 
02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
for 20 end of 23 and you know 20 going
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
into 24 and 25.
 
02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
sure well my crystal ball will tell you
 
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're coming back down to three but
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's not micro symbol is really what
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
all I do is change I think that's a
 
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
bottle yeah yeah absolutely you got that
 
02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:13.730 align:start position:0%
bottle yeah yeah absolutely you got that
right

02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:36:15.290 --> 02:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
um well you know a couple things and
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'll mention you know like I said we're
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
not economists but I'll mention what Dr
 
02:36:21.650 --> 02:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Yoon our national Economist for
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
the National Association let's talk
 
02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
about interest rates one thing I'll say
 
02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
about interest rates that's interesting
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:36:30.710 --> 02:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
eight ten months ago a buyer could have
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
come in and bought a home and got a
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
three four percent interest rate right
 
02:36:37.010 --> 02:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's almost like free money for those
 
02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:38.660 align:start position:0%
of us been in the market for a while
 
02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
however I'm dealing with Buyers today
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
that are saying okay we're going to get
 
02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
a six six and a half percent interest
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
rate however they now know in most
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
situations they don't have to offer a
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars more on that
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
house to get it now than they did 10
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
months ago at the three percent interest
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
rate you know even though they're at six
 
02:37:01.010 --> 02:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
now so it's not exact science and and
 
02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
math but they understand that they're
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
not paying more than asking price for
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
most situations in residential real
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
estate today and they know that there is
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
going to be the chance that they might
 
02:37:14.570 --> 02:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
be able to refinance down the road so
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the buyers that I'm dealing
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
with are thinking that process they
 
02:37:20.570 --> 02:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
still need a place to live and they've
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
been talking to their parents their
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents and know that six six and a
 
02:37:28.849 --> 02:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
half is still historically a very good
 
02:37:31.849 --> 02:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
interest rate historically we were we've
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
been very spoiled in the market in the
 
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
last few years where we were in the high
 
02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
twos threes for interest rates
 
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm seeing that happen now what
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
is what is the prediction uh well
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
Lawrence uh Yoon uh who we we think is
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a genius in in our Realm of
 
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
the world
 
02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
um he's thinking that interest rates
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
have peaked and that he predicts that
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
they will be coming down
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
um he he uh thinks that the
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
um eclipsing at late of uh 2022 is seven
 
02:38:07.849 --> 02:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
percent he thinks that it might settle
 
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
at 5.7 at some point later this year as
 
02:38:15.410 --> 02:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
the FED tries to slow the pace of rate
 
02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
hikes to control inflation so that's
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
kind of his prediction so if that comes
 
02:38:20.819 --> 02:38:22.370 align:start position:0%
kind of his prediction so if that comes
true

02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's still not three or four
 
02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
percent but if it's in the fives that is
 
02:38:29.809 --> 02:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
really going to be very attractive to a
 
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
lot of buyers you know there still are a
 
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
lot of buyers out there that still have
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
to get mortgages one of the things that
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
we have been seeing in the buyer pool
 
02:38:43.490 --> 02:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
relative to getting mortgages is the
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
adjustable rate mortgage we did not hear
 
02:38:48.250 --> 02:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
about adjustable rate mortgages
 
02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic one people paid
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of cash throughout the pandemic
 
02:38:56.210 --> 02:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
and two interest rates were so low for
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
those that know what an adjustable rate
 
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
is right you can't get much lower than
 
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
two or three percent so the adjustable
 
02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
rate mortgage wasn't even heard of we
 
02:39:09.290 --> 02:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
joke about this but we have members that
 
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
are realtors that are brand new to the
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
industry they've never even heard of an
 
02:39:15.050 --> 02:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
adjustable rate mortgage right so we
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
have to teach them what that product is
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
that some of their buyers May benefit
 
02:39:21.889 --> 02:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
from it so we are seeing that the
 
02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
adjustable rate being offered by some of
 
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
our lenders at a little lower rate to
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
get people into the house to help them
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
out with it being adjusted over over
 
02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
time now you'll see this slide this is
 
02:39:36.650 --> 02:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
from the National Association Dr
 
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Yoon so you can see the years
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
that he has there what his forecasts are
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
for unit sales in 2022 23 and 24. and
 
02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
what he thinks the home prices may do as
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
well as dollar volume so you know he's
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
very optimistic about what's going to go
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
forward here now this is on the national
 
02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:00.670 align:start position:0%
forward here now this is on the national
scale

02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
scale
 
02:40:04.849 --> 02:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a firm believer in our state and
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
I and I hope that these are more a
 
02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
little more more positive than the
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
national scale looks for New Hampshire
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
because our values have always held
 
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
strong here in this state and I think
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
they will continue
 
02:40:19.250 --> 02:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn over either Bob or Chris
 
02:40:21.290 --> 02:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
whoever wants to start now
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh certainly so uh grab this microphone
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Chris Norwood and I am the
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
the commercial broker here on the panel
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you may see me from time to time
 
02:40:34.610 --> 02:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
in these hallways I am also the public
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
policy chair
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
um at least until they kick me out
 
02:40:39.889 --> 02:40:39.899 align:start position:0%
um so I thought I would at least Define
 
02:40:42.530 --> 02:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate as I work in it
 
02:40:45.050 --> 02:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
and so so everyone in this room knows is
 
02:40:46.849 --> 02:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
I am part of the New Hampshire
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors uh which
 
02:40:51.530 --> 02:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
predominantly focuses on residential but
 
02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
also we have about two to 250 members
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
that Focus exclusively or primarily in
 
02:40:59.929 --> 02:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate and as I Define
 
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
commercial the primary food groups are
 
02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
the office Market the industrial Market
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
in the retail market and then you can
 
02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
also look at the investment Market be
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
that a triple net leased CVS or a
 
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
multi-family investment or a
 
02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
specialty-use product like a hotel motel
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
gas station Etc
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
so historically and I don't have the
 
02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
pretty graphs because commercial data is
 
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
not as transparent so when you go to
 
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
sign a lease for a building it's great
 
02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
that if I can capture that data so it
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
helps me with my next opinion of value
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
or an appraiser helps it with their next
 
02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
valuation but you know leasing data is
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
hard to come by and on the sale data
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's just there is some uh
 
02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
some trends that we can follow but it's
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
not as transparent you need a lot more
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
data to really uh to talk about that but
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
I am help happy to answer any questions
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
02:42:00.050 --> 02:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
so starting back in 2020 there was a the
 
02:42:01.969 --> 02:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
shutdown right so if you look at the
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
second and the third quarters of 2020 we
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
were I we could should have gone
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
unsabbatical right there was no
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
properties to transact the phone wasn't
 
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.570 align:start position:0%
properties to transact the phone wasn't
ringing

02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
ringing
 
02:42:14.450 --> 02:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
um people were in the office Market were
 
02:42:15.889 --> 02:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
really trying to do what we referred to
 
02:42:17.929 --> 02:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
as blend and extend they were trying to
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
extend out their lease rates seeing that
 
02:42:21.770 --> 02:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
there may be a decline in the leasing
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
environment but a lot of the
 
02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
um the thinking in that time was maybe
 
02:42:30.969 --> 02:42:30.979 align:start position:0%
ill-formed because starting in the third
 
02:42:34.130 --> 02:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
and to fourth quarter of 2020 and then
 
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
for about six to seven quarters as Ben
 
02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
said it was pretty good business to be
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
in in commercial real estate
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so where where are we right now and
 
02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
where are we going so if we look at the
 
02:42:49.130 --> 02:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
major food groups and we talk about uh
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
things like the cost of construction and
 
02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
the impact of interest rates I'll just
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
go through them real briefly I think the
 
02:42:58.730 --> 02:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
office Market our employees as we look
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
at ourselves as a state where are we I
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
think for the most part New Hampshire as
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to larger cities like Boston are
 
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing a better job inviting folks back
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
into the work environment that is
 
02:43:15.410 --> 02:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
continued to bolster the office Market
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are there segments of
 
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
the economy and segments of the business
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
Community where people are less likely
 
02:43:26.929 --> 02:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
to go back absolutely when you have a
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
large office building of a single tenant
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
of hundreds of thousands of square feet
 
02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
and you have multiple employees that can
 
02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
share desks in that environment I do
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
believe their real estate footprint is
 
02:43:42.290 --> 02:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
going to shrink but if you're talking
 
02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
about the local real estate office or a
 
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:46.580 align:start position:0%
local attorney's office or engineering
 
02:43:48.770 --> 02:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
those people are still coming back
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
because they're smaller offices
 
02:43:53.210 --> 02:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
typically in New Hampshire and unlike
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
Boston we're not asking employees to
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
fight 93 for an hour and a half each way
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's a different invitation back into
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
the market so I do think there's going
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be a softening in the office Market
 
02:44:08.090 --> 02:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
but perhaps not as dramatically as as
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
some of our neighbors
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you look then at the retail Market
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
retail has continued to strengthen and
 
02:44:18.830 --> 02:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
we saw this in the early 2000s and I
 
02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be doomsday that because
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
obviously there was a cliff there but a
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
lot of retail is is predicated on
 
02:44:29.330 --> 02:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
interest rates and as we see interest
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
rates climb we have to be cognizant the
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
credit card rates climb but what we've
 
02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
seen now that didn't happen in 2007
 
02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
before the Great Recession is the
 
02:44:41.809 --> 02:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
Adaptive reuse of a lot of retail
 
02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
facilities so if you notice retail now
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
is no longer where I go to Just
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily buy my groceries there's
 
02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as experiential retail
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that cities and towns and us
 
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
as a state needs to think about what
 
02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
that means I take my kids out we go to a
 
02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
bouncy house and that is our afternoon
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
then we go and get coffee next door and
 
02:45:04.969 --> 02:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
an ice cream on the way home so that
 
02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
bouncy house or that education facility
 
02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
or that insert your experiential retail
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
here is an Adaptive reuse of something
 
02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
that was initially thought to be a
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
grocery store but now it is something
 
02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
else and I think that that trend is
 
02:45:21.730 --> 02:45:21.740 align:start position:0%
going to continue
 
02:45:24.650 --> 02:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
the next piece to talk about briefly is
 
02:45:26.270 --> 02:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
the strongest part of our economy
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
relative to real estate which is the
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
industrial sector
 
02:45:32.929 --> 02:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
so Ben you were talking about his
 
02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
history and so I've been in real estate
 
02:45:38.690 --> 02:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
now I think I got licensed in 2000 2002
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there and for most of my
 
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
career how much does it cost to rent an
 
02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
industrial building I don't know five to
 
02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
six and a half bucks a square foot day
 
02:45:50.570 --> 02:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
in and day out day in and day out now
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
that same building is pushing into the
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
low double digits and if you want new
 
02:45:58.250 --> 02:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
construction which by the way new
 
02:45:59.809 --> 02:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
construction needs to be high Bay
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
meaning 24 foot higher or sorry 20 foot
 
02:46:06.250 --> 02:46:06.260 align:start position:0%
clear or higher
 
02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
those buildings you're renting out now
 
02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
for double digits and it's the only way
 
02:46:15.170 --> 02:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
an investor or or in some cases an owner
 
02:46:17.929 --> 02:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
occupant can justify the cost of new
 
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
construction because construction steel
 
02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
labor is so high not to mention
 
02:46:28.010 --> 02:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
um just the the added cost of code to
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
build these buildings has been
 
02:46:31.849 --> 02:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
increasing over over the years but let's
 
02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
stay with a positive industrial
 
02:46:35.469 --> 02:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
continues to be strong
 
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
and and that is I think directly
 
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
correlated to the challenges we've seen
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
in the last two years
 
02:46:44.330 --> 02:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
I was at a meeting this morning with a
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who said I I need warehouse
 
02:46:51.969 --> 02:46:51.979 align:start position:0%
space I am not going to risk my business
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
like I have in the last 24 months to
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
supply chain I need to know that I have
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
in this case he wanted a seasonal
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
business he wanted to have at least 12
 
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
months of inventory in his own Warehouse
 
02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
that he could touch if there was ever
 
02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
another supply chain issue so I do think
 
02:47:13.130 --> 02:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
that we we do exist in a broader uh
 
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
political environment where people
 
02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
understand what's happened in the last
 
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
12 to 24 months relative to supply chain
 
02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
and on the industrial Side manufacturing
 
02:47:25.490 --> 02:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
and Warehouse that's where we're seeing
 
02:47:26.809 --> 02:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
the increase
 
02:47:29.090 --> 02:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's for the larger buildings there
 
02:47:30.830 --> 02:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
are still a lot of smaller industrial
 
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
that again continue to be strong I I
 
02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
share Ben's view that when I see
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
single-family home constructions what I
 
02:47:41.570 --> 02:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
see are title companies mortgage
 
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
companies plumbers electricians that are
 
02:47:46.450 --> 02:47:46.460 align:start position:0%
helping put those homes on the market
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I do think that if there is going to
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
be a Slowdown in the economy I am
 
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
concerned about the smaller what we
 
02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
refer to as the contractor industrial
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
Bays so that that plumber who has six
 
02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
trucks and um and is right now has just
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
been putting those people out all day
 
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
long are they going to continue to have
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the income to pay their condo
 
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
fees to pay their real estate taxes and
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
so forth because they've just been going
 
02:48:17.270 --> 02:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
fly I mean I can't get a plumber I mean
 
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
God forbid any one of us has a sink
 
02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:20.450 align:start position:0%
God forbid any one of us has a sink
burst

02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
burst
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
um but that's how I view the office
 
02:48:25.309 --> 02:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
industrial retail Market lastly I do
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
just want to touch upon the invest
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
assessment Market because I do think it
 
02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
goes to the question about interest
 
02:48:33.050 --> 02:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
rates so the investment Market where
 
02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
that may be anything from a four to six
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
to twelve unit apartment building or
 
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
whether it's a larger Mall retail
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
building or a single tenant leased
 
02:48:45.770 --> 02:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
office or
 
02:48:48.050 --> 02:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
um Pharmacy
 
02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
the the largest single change that I
 
02:48:54.650 --> 02:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
have seen in the last six months has
 
02:48:57.290 --> 02:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
been the I don't want to overstate it
 
02:48:59.270 --> 02:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
but the uh
 
02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
I was going to say Exodus of investors
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
but I think that that's too strong uh
 
02:49:09.170 --> 02:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
the uh Movement by investors away from
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
Real Estate not 100 percent but what
 
02:49:15.889 --> 02:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
they're saying is sellers are still
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
pricing their assets at a three percent
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
interest rate
 
02:49:22.490 --> 02:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
and investors are coming in and
 
02:49:24.410 --> 02:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
borrowing seven
 
02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
and there's no more room for an investor
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
or in some cases developer if I'm going
 
02:49:33.889 --> 02:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
to build a new building and lease it out
 
02:49:36.530 --> 02:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
to tenants that developer that investor
 
02:49:39.170 --> 02:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
that profit margin is now taken by that
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
growth in the interest rates a quick
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
math I did yesterday was on a 20-year
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage which is traditional for
 
02:49:48.429 --> 02:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate
 
02:49:51.050 --> 02:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
the buying power for every hundred
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of buying power that
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
you had six months ago you now have
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
eighty one thousand dollars worth of
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
buying power with traditional rates
 
02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
now the the bright side I like to think
 
02:50:05.570 --> 02:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
somewhat optimistically is that Real
 
02:50:07.370 --> 02:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
Estate Investors real estate developers
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
do not have the same Horizon window that
 
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
single-family homeowners do my wife and
 
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
I just renovated our house and that's
 
02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
going to be the house
 
02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
knock on wood that we're going to raise
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
our four kids in
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
um but most res commercial folks have a
 
02:50:26.809 --> 02:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
five-year balloon on their interest rate
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they're thinking of okay I'm gonna
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
lock it in and it may be 10 years right
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon it but they're looking at
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
a declining real estate interest rate
 
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
that they foresee forecasting coming up
 
02:50:42.889 --> 02:50:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the next five years so I do think
 
02:50:45.650 --> 02:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
that there is some positive news that
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
some investors are doing this they're
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
holding their nose they're taking the
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
seven percent interest rate in the
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
thought that things will be at a point
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
that they can refinance some cash out in
 
02:50:59.150 --> 02:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
a number of years but again holistically
 
02:51:00.889 --> 02:51:00.899 align:start position:0%
industrial is leading the market
 
02:51:03.230 --> 02:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
interest rates have really pushed
 
02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
investors particularly on the apartment
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
units to the side whereby we are seeing
 
02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
more owner occupants particularly on the
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
commercial side the industrial users
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're saying I want to buy I know the
 
02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
interest rate seven percent but darn it
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
I need that building because I don't
 
02:51:21.849 --> 02:51:21.859 align:start position:0%
want to be impacted by the supply chain
 
02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
so uh happy to entertain any questions
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
on that as well
 
02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:29.389 align:start position:0%
on that as well
foreign

02:51:29.389 --> 02:51:29.399 align:start position:0%

Madam chair
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
um if there's an economic downturn
 
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
what what do you see as the chances of
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
us having another foreclosure crisis
 
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
as we did in the last recession
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
is it high or have there been enough
 
02:51:57.230 --> 02:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
structural changes in how much of a
 
02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
purchase homeowners can Finance
 
02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
well just from a
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know from our our Economist relative
 
02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
to that what his prediction is that he
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
he predicts foreclosure rates are still
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
going to be very low
 
02:52:15.170 --> 02:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
um nationally less than one percent of
 
02:52:16.809 --> 02:52:16.819 align:start position:0%
all mortgages is what he predicts for
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
2023. so I don't think we're going to
 
02:52:21.170 --> 02:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
see too much of that here in New
 
02:52:22.849 --> 02:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know it's
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
we obviously had the Meltdown crisis
 
02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we all remember
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
um but over the last few years I've
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
haven't really seen that much and we
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that that's going to
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
happen much and nor does Dr Lawrence
 
02:52:38.210 --> 02:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
Yoon Bob yeah just added you know prior
 
02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
to the the Great Recession
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
um as often referred to I hear from a
 
02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
lot of Realtors you know if you had a
 
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
pulse you got a mortgage
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
um no matter what it was it was very
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
simple to get a mortgage
 
02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um the structural changes have occurred
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
and that's no longer true
 
02:52:55.550 --> 02:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
um so you don't have people who are
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
basically putting down no money for a
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
400 500 000 home that suddenly is valued
 
02:53:02.210 --> 02:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
at three hundred thousand dollars and
 
02:53:03.650 --> 02:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
they're underwater and go into
 
02:53:06.050 --> 02:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
foreclosure so that's not the case and
 
02:53:07.849 --> 02:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
in the past 10 years if you see the
 
02:53:09.650 --> 02:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
median sale prices have increased
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of equity has been built
 
02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
up in those Property Owners so you know
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you bought a home uh in 2019 you're
 
02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
doing pretty well right now in terms of
 
02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
how much Equity has been built up in
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
that home and I think that's going to
 
02:53:25.309 --> 02:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
change and that and that's something in
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which um maybe isn't the
 
02:53:30.650 --> 02:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
case everywhere in the country
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say lastly on the
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
investment front and I said I wasn't
 
02:53:36.769 --> 02:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
going to get too statistical but prior
 
02:53:39.410 --> 02:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the Great Recession you saw average
 
02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
per unit multi-family sales be somewhere
 
02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
around 80 to 100 000 and then decline
 
02:53:48.590 --> 02:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
down to uh you know forty or fifty
 
02:53:50.210 --> 02:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the Great Recession
 
02:53:52.190 --> 02:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I can say from personal experience
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
that I was doing opinion of values in
 
02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession driving around in uh
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
you know Manchester Nashua and the
 
02:54:03.170 --> 02:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
lenders whom were my clients never set
 
02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
foot in the state and there was a lot of
 
02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
cash chasing investors that wasn't the
 
02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
best underwriting I think the
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
underwriting that I've seen in the last
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
decade particularly on the multi-family
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
investment side has been a lot stronger
 
02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
so that gives me a little bit more hope
 
02:54:21.530 --> 02:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh where we're going great news thank
 
02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:22.969 align:start position:0%
uh where we're going great news thank
you

02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
and and I'll also um just mention that
 
02:54:28.969 --> 02:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
we can talk about
 
02:54:31.370 --> 02:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
um as we're looking at where the housing
 
02:54:33.410 --> 02:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
market New Hampshire is going inflation
 
02:54:36.410 --> 02:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
rates mortgage rates wages General
 
02:54:38.210 --> 02:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
Health of the economy
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but that that those economic data
 
02:54:46.250 --> 02:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
points can't be the only reason for the
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
decline in inventory because we've seen
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
the study decline over the past decade
 
02:54:55.309 --> 02:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
so there is something that 800 pound
 
02:54:57.170 --> 02:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
gorilla I guess is sitting here which is
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
we as a state are not creating enough
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
housing supply enough housing stock to
 
02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
meet the demand it is decreasing and
 
02:55:10.130 --> 02:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's I think still an in a very a crisis
 
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
level when you're talking about only a
 
02:55:13.969 --> 02:55:13.979 align:start position:0%
month worth of inventory available
 
02:55:13.979 --> 02:55:15.170 align:start position:0%
month worth of inventory available
so

02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know I was talking to Ben earlier on
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh in his neck of the woods there's a
 
02:55:21.650 --> 02:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
municipality up there that has taking
 
02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
the challenge of housing seriously and
 
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
they are doing all sorts of creative
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
things both with Apartments
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and other ways
 
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:34.370 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and other ways
because

02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
their businesses their local businesses
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
are demanding it indicating we cannot
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
find employees and when we do they
 
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes will accept the job but then
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
have to decline because they cannot find
 
02:55:47.170 --> 02:55:47.180 align:start position:0%
an adequate home
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
so we have some municipalities who are
 
02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
taking that very sincerely that same
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
municipality I was talking to there
 
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
someone who worked for that
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
um that's it that time the municipality
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
so the problem is the towns around us
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
have pulled up the drawbridge and they
 
02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
are not permitting anything from being
 
02:56:07.969 --> 02:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
built so it's all on our shoulders we
 
02:56:11.330 --> 02:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
all value local control that's the way
 
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
things are done in New Hampshire but we
 
02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
would also suggest to you as public
 
02:56:17.570 --> 02:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
policy makers that there is a role for
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
the state to plan all of this or else
 
02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
you're just going to have when does one
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
Town's local control start to impact
 
02:56:26.809 --> 02:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
another Town's ability to control their
 
02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
local control
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
their their borders if you want to add
 
02:56:30.180 --> 02:56:31.070 align:start position:0%
their their borders if you want to add
anything

02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative again
 
02:56:35.809 --> 02:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't know who wants to answer this
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
but um we certainly know that there's a
 
02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
lack of housing in New Hampshire it's a
 
02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
huge problem and we need to figure out
 
02:56:47.090 --> 02:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
how to address it is New Hampshire how
 
02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
unique is New Hampshire in this or is
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
this a problem across the country
 
02:56:54.650 --> 02:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
so it's a problem across the country
 
02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:55.250 align:start position:0%
so it's a problem across the country
um

02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
but it is a bit more acute here in New
 
02:56:59.809 --> 02:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think probably it's hard
 
02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:01.220 align:start position:0%
to compare New Hampshire to Colorado
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to pair New Hampshire
 
02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
to Maine so if you look at Maine in
 
02:57:07.849 --> 02:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
month supply inventory they have more
 
02:57:14.330 --> 02:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
inventory available I don't have the
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
data right in front of me you know if
 
02:57:18.290 --> 02:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
we're at 1.2 they were they're still in
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
trouble but they're at 2.5 2.6 or
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
something like that New Hampshire always
 
02:57:25.969 --> 02:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a um
 
02:57:25.979 --> 02:57:27.530 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a um
advantage

02:57:27.530 --> 02:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
02:57:30.849 --> 02:57:30.859 align:start position:0%
in many ways over Massachusetts
 
02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
especially that Northeastern corner of
 
02:57:37.490 --> 02:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the value of uh median
 
02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
sale price was always a bit so it was
 
02:57:41.929 --> 02:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
more affordable that's not quite the
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
case anymore I was looking at
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts data this past week in
 
02:57:47.769 --> 02:57:47.779 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
you know uh your median sale price for
 
02:57:55.370 --> 02:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
the county uh at the year end was 550 or
 
02:57:57.769 --> 02:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
something it's in your packet that's
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
pretty much what it is in Northeast
 
02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well so we've kind of
 
02:58:05.410 --> 02:58:05.420 align:start position:0%
caught up to them and
 
02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
I it's being around County
 
02:58:11.929 --> 02:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
um the total number of homes that were
 
02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
sold single-family homes in Rockingham
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
County only 10 percent sold for less
 
02:58:18.410 --> 02:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
than 400 000
 
02:58:19.610 --> 02:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
um last year
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
so the vast majority of properties in
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County are being sold for
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars and above
 
02:58:28.429 --> 02:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact your first time
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
home buyer you know that's a very
 
02:58:32.210 --> 02:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
challenging thing for someone to do I
 
02:58:33.410 --> 02:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
will also bring up and I met someone
 
02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
recently who who mentioned this to me
 
02:58:37.490 --> 02:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
they were retiree they were living in a
 
02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
they were retiree they were living in a
community

02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:58:40.250 --> 02:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
they just retired they had to downsize
 
02:58:44.870 --> 02:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
can't find anything in their town that
 
02:58:46.670 --> 02:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
they can afford and so he's like listen
 
02:58:48.769 --> 02:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
I've grown up in this town of Linda's
 
02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
town all my life I have to move I have
 
02:58:51.769 --> 02:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
to leave the town because there's
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
nothing available for me
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy
 
02:59:03.410 --> 02:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my sense is that
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the many many factors that are
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
affecting the housing market and driving
 
02:59:07.730 --> 02:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
it such
 
02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:09.110 align:start position:0%
it such
situation

02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
that the influx of people we had from
 
02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
other States during the pandemic was a
 
02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
big was a big cause
 
02:59:16.500 --> 02:59:18.349 align:start position:0%
big was a big cause
um

02:59:18.349 --> 02:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:19.969 --> 02:59:19.979 align:start position:0%
is there any indication that they're
 
02:59:21.889 --> 02:59:21.899 align:start position:0%
leaving have any there has been any
 
02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
buyers in Mars or they just should be
 
02:59:24.650 --> 02:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
playing for them to stick around for the
 
02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:25.490 align:start position:0%
playing for them to stick around for the
next

02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah you know I I that's a great
 
02:59:35.929 --> 02:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
question uh you know being from New
 
02:59:37.849 --> 02:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
London small little town we don't have
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
enough stop light in New London but in
 
02:59:41.210 --> 02:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
the summertime when it takes more than
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
10 minutes to get from the post office
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
to the college as Tom knows I'm ready
 
02:59:47.870 --> 02:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
for all of them to go home uh meaning
 
02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
the summer folks
 
02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know I I'm not sure if they're
 
02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
leaving you know one thing I can tell
 
02:59:56.990 --> 02:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
you is I know uh being on the school
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
board and the curesearch Regional School
 
03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
District and and having a good friend
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
that is on the Sunapee School Board
 
03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of families actually moved up
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and enrolled their
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
kids in our school districts our numbers
 
03:00:12.889 --> 03:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
went up a little bit as did centipedes
 
03:00:15.650 --> 03:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
and they're staying they're they're not
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
leaving you know they had a they had
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
another house up here already and this
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
is their primary residence now so I
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of people moving out
 
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
um once again
 
03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
um you know I I sell the New Hampshire
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
experience to be people and a lot of
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
people want to live here and
 
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing also is because of what
 
03:00:38.690 --> 03:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
happened throughout the pandemic you can
 
03:00:40.969 --> 03:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
work from home now why would they leave
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
why would they leave
 
03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
I think just one piece of data so as as
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn mentioned I also
 
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
serve as the chair of New Hampshire
 
03:00:54.050 --> 03:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority Ben Frost and
 
03:00:55.849 --> 03:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
his team from New Hampshire housing had
 
03:00:59.090 --> 03:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
done some research in 2021 and I don't
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
know if they captured that same data in
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
22 but what they did is they looked at
 
03:01:08.690 --> 03:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
all the transfers in historic years to
 
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
find out typically how many
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
transactions happen from New Hampshire
 
03:01:17.530 --> 03:01:17.540 align:start position:0%
sellers to out-of-state buyers
 
03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
and again I don't have the data for 2022
 
03:01:22.490 --> 03:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
but I share it from the increase from
 
03:01:25.269 --> 03:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
2020 to
 
03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
2021 was only around two percent from an
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
increase of out-of-state buyers and so I
 
03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
I suggest that to say that I do think
 
03:01:40.010 --> 03:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
that the out-of-state folks are mostly
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
in line of what Ben is saying is where
 
03:01:44.690 --> 03:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
there are already folks who had a second
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
home and they're moving here the people
 
03:01:49.849 --> 03:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
who are buying in New Hampshire knew I
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
think have got a lot of media attention
 
03:01:53.690 --> 03:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not saying that they're not
 
03:01:55.849 --> 03:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
there I just don't believe that the
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
statistics say that they are the only
 
03:02:01.250 --> 03:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
reason for the increase in in um in
 
03:02:02.690 --> 03:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
housing prices
 
03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think those stats were somewhere in
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of 70 about 70 percent of
 
03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
all transactions uh are New Hampshire
 
03:02:13.250 --> 03:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
residents moving to another home in New
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so 30 percent would come from
 
03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
out of state when it changed during the
 
03:02:22.570 --> 03:02:22.580 align:start position:0%
pandemic maybe it went down to 67.
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang and then representative
 
03:02:27.050 --> 03:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
Bolton please so I I I'm sorry I just
 
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on that this this
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
conversation so are you saying that we
 
03:02:32.809 --> 03:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
we there's no data point to capture
 
03:02:34.849 --> 03:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
because they already owned a home and
 
03:02:35.929 --> 03:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
they may have made that now their
 
03:02:37.969 --> 03:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
primary home and so there's no housing
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
data point to capture is that is that
 
03:02:42.290 --> 03:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
your yeah for the subset that Ben
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned which are folks that
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
um were already had a second home that
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh moved up here I think the data to
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
capture and I spoke with folks
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
anecdotally is if you looked at school
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment records from 2020 to 2021 in
 
03:03:01.730 --> 03:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh communities that are predominantly
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
vacation communities you saw upticks in
 
03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
um but you wouldn't necessarily capture
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
that subset I.E people who already owned
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.210 --> 03:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:03:19.309 --> 03:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
um this is gonna get a quick one but uh
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
regarding that town or city that is
 
03:03:23.450 --> 03:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
doing creative things for Housing
 
03:03:28.929 --> 03:03:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.130 --> 03:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
I think there are clearly some
 
03:03:37.610 --> 03:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
communities which
 
03:03:40.690 --> 03:03:40.700 align:start position:0%
um have met the
 
03:03:46.190 --> 03:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
housing and um Challenge in a way that's
 
03:03:49.250 --> 03:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
um sincere and I I don't it's hard to
 
03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
point to each Community because then you
 
03:03:51.769 --> 03:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
forget one and someone says well where
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
do I mean I think places like Exeter and
 
03:03:56.450 --> 03:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh Lebanon
 
03:03:59.389 --> 03:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
um are are making real attempts to and
 
03:04:01.250 --> 03:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
there are others too I'm not in Dover
 
03:04:03.230 --> 03:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
and there are plenty of others
 
03:04:05.330 --> 03:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that the overall point
 
03:04:05.340 --> 03:04:06.550 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that the overall point
is

03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
some communities are doing this uh and
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
others are not and so then the question
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
becomes is there a state role to play to
 
03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
ensure that hey looks and everybody's
 
03:04:21.050 --> 03:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
gotta participate in this in order to
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
meet this affordability problem
 
03:04:26.809 --> 03:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
and if I could there are a couple quick
 
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh solutions to like exchanging of
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
development rights if you take land that
 
03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
you would otherwise put into
 
03:04:34.670 --> 03:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
conservation in exchange what could be
 
03:04:36.769 --> 03:04:36.779 align:start position:0%
developed on that land into an area that
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
already has Municipal Water and Sewer uh
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a solution that could be a
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
uniquely New Hampshire solution that we
 
03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
could offer to uh municipalities
 
03:04:50.210 --> 03:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
to the senate members who are here the
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
speaker created a special committee on
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
housing to try to really drill down on
 
03:04:57.469 --> 03:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
this so hopefully you will participate
 
03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
in whatever they're doing there I saw a
 
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
hand on this corner did I not no any
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
other hands for questions
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think this
 
03:05:11.809 --> 03:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
message is for Chris uh this question is
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
for Chris
 
03:05:14.330 --> 03:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that the
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
multi-family Market
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I think pre-great recession was about
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
80 to 100K per unit dropped to about 40K
 
03:05:27.410 --> 03:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
per unit what is it now uh
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
for the class you know B wood frame
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
stuff it's probably 100 to 115 120. for
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
the class A stuff where there's a nice
 
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
Lobby and you know the the above a
 
03:05:41.690 --> 03:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
builder grade you're talking many many
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
higher multiples because it goes back to
 
03:05:46.010 --> 03:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
that cost of construction so I can put
 
03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
on my New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
Authority hat and I can say that you
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
know to build new construction nowadays
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's three hundred thousand dollars per
 
03:05:57.530 --> 03:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
unit all in land soft costs Etc
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
aren't you
 
03:05:59.760 --> 03:06:00.889 align:start position:0%
aren't you
guys

03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
guys
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
um I I know everyone's eager to get to
 
03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
lunch and we're the last I guess of the
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
two days so
 
03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
um but just to sort of wrap up in terms
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
of getting into some of the questions
 
03:06:12.410 --> 03:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
regarding you know how do we improve
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh inventory in the state and bring
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
down affordability we do have to take
 
03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we have reached out to and we've had
 
03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversations with Municipal
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
leaders in terms of some of the
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
challenges that they face land use
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
boards what are they hearing from from
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
their residents and um you know one of
 
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
the contributing factors certainly not
 
03:06:32.929 --> 03:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
the only is a concern by some
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
communities have is hey if I build more
 
03:06:34.319 --> 03:06:35.469 align:start position:0%
communities have is hey if I build more
housing

03:06:35.469 --> 03:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
then that means we're going to see more
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
school-age kids come into my community
 
03:06:42.290 --> 03:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
those school age kids are then going to
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
go into my school and I'm gonna have to
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
pay for them and so therefore my taxes
 
03:06:48.429 --> 03:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
are going to go up if more kids come in
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
so several years ago we looked at this
 
03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
issue we actually
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
brought in a an economist from the
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and he
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
basically just went through every single
 
03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
town in New Hampshire uh looked at what
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
their education tax rates have been over
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
the past decade and what their
 
03:07:05.450 --> 03:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
enrollment and try and find a
 
03:07:07.210 --> 03:07:07.220 align:start position:0%
correlation to it
 
03:07:10.670 --> 03:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
with your Indulgence we actually have a
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
quick five minute video that uh if you
 
03:07:16.610 --> 03:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
are willing to uh watch
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and then this will kind of explain it
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
follow and educating those kids means
 
03:07:30.530 --> 03:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers will pay more what is
 
03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
it really true two additional school-age
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
kids actually engage property tax
 
03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:35.809 align:start position:0%
kids actually engage property tax
increases

03:07:35.809 --> 03:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:07:37.250 --> 03:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
the question is critical to New
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policymakers at the local and
 
03:07:40.490 --> 03:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
state level because of reluctance to

to the state's growing house and

affordability crisis it seems to be
 
03:07:49.370 --> 03:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
believed at least in some circles across
 
03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
the state that if you build more housing
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a town and that brings families and
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
children into town the additional School
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment will raise local property
 
03:08:00.479 --> 03:08:01.670 align:start position:0%

taxes
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
that belief I think is an impediment to
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
building more housing uh more affordable
 
03:08:11.090 --> 03:08:11.100 align:start position:0%

03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
to determine if more kids in town
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
inevitably leads to higher property

taxes
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
my research found that it simply isn't
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
true one cannot say that that if you
 
03:08:39.290 --> 03:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
bring more children into town and they
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
enter the public schools that the
 
03:08:43.849 --> 03:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
property tax will go up it simply isn't
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
supported by the data or by Logic the
 
03:08:48.530 --> 03:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
school administration costs could stay
 
03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
roughly the same does Debt Service on
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
the bonds that were issued in past years
 
03:08:57.170 --> 03:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
go up no the the cost of Debt Service
 
03:09:01.010 --> 03:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
stays the same if enrollment goes up not
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
all parts of the cost side of the budget
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
go up in proportion to even
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs go up school
 
03:09:11.450 --> 03:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
transportation costs probably not uh
 
03:09:13.610 --> 03:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
because they're they're often are empty
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
seats on school buses if you have more
 
03:09:18.290 --> 03:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
enrollment you just put more kids on the
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
existing buses so it's not the case that
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
if more kids come to town that the costs
 
03:09:29.929 --> 03:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
go up by the average cost of educating
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
the kids who are already in the district
 
03:09:34.250 --> 03:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
in virtually every Community across the
 
03:09:36.050 --> 03:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
state the number of students enrolled in
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
public schools has been steadily
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
declining in fact prior to the pandemic
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the state's 234 municipalities only
 
03:09:45.410 --> 03:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
29 communities experienced growth in
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
school enrollment in the previous decade
 
03:09:49.370 --> 03:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
while more than 200 saw School
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline
 
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
so as School enrollment has decreased at
 
03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
property taxes in towns dropped in fact
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
the opposite has been true in many cases
 
03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
as towns have seen a steady increase in
 
03:10:03.170 --> 03:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
tax rates even as school populations
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
have declined
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the decade just before
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
the onset of Covenant and what's
 
03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
happened to class sizes what you find is
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
that in a large majority of school
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
districts across state class size
 
03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:21.769 align:start position:0%
districts across state class size
declined

03:10:21.769 --> 03:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
declined
 
03:10:24.290 --> 03:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
what you find when you do that data
 
03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
analysis is that there's almost no
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
correlation at all between enrollment
 
03:10:32.929 --> 03:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
percentage changes in enrollment and
 
03:10:35.809 --> 03:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
changes in the school tax rate yes there
 
03:10:39.769 --> 03:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
are examples of of communities where
 
03:10:42.590 --> 03:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment went up over a 10-year period
 
03:10:45.769 --> 03:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
and the school tax rate went up but
 
03:10:48.349 --> 03:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
there are also plenty of examples of
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
communities where enrollment went down
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the school tax rate went up
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
of the 11 largest school districts in
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
the state Dover for instance saw
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
substantial growth in its student
 
03:11:01.309 --> 03:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
population yet had a smaller increase in
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
its School tax rate than six of the
 
03:11:04.730 --> 03:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
largest districts with declining student
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
enrollments this provides some
 
03:11:08.210 --> 03:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
preliminary evidence that student
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment is not the primary driver of
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
the local tax rate for public schools
 
03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
the largest increase in school tax rate
 
03:11:16.849 --> 03:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
came in Salem a town that experienced a
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 percent decline in the number
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
of elementary students during the decade
 
03:11:23.450 --> 03:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
in fact only seven communities in New
 
03:11:25.370 --> 03:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire experienced both a decreased
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
School enrollment and a lower school tax
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
rate and many communities which saw the
 
03:11:31.730 --> 03:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
largest drop-in students also
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
experienced the largest increase in
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
their school taxes the issue of
 
03:11:37.910 --> 03:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
construction of Workforce housing and
 
03:11:39.710 --> 03:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
the impact on the tax rate is an
 
03:11:41.929 --> 03:11:41.939 align:start position:0%
important one and I can understand why
 
03:11:46.330 --> 03:11:46.340 align:start position:0%
many Town officials in in town residents
 
03:11:49.969 --> 03:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
are asking this question but I think we
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
have to be uh be look into the data we
 
03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
can't just assume that if we enroll more
 
03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
kids in the schools that the tax rates
 
03:12:02.330 --> 03:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
will go up and to assume that is to
 
03:12:04.370 --> 03:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we're going to continue
 
03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
to have a housing affordability problem
 
03:12:08.210 --> 03:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
so what are the long-term implications
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
for a town and a state with fewer kids
 
03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
after all working age people generally
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
have school-aged children if the public
 
03:12:19.849 --> 03:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
policy position of a municipality is to
 
03:12:21.410 --> 03:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
keep children out of its Community by
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
limiting the housing Supply it should
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
logically mean that it will also have
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
fewer working age residents without
 
03:12:29.809 --> 03:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
those workers employers will not have
 
03:12:32.450 --> 03:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
the employees to expand and help to grow
