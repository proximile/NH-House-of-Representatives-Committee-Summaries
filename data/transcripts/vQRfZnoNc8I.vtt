attack today is uh we only have our last
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
two bills um both Senate bills obviously
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 605 which deals with um with
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
ethics and uh we also have the other
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
bill um that deals with the portrait for
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha full Clark um and we're
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
waiting for an amendment on that so
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully that arrives before we get uh
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
anticipating much of a problem um with
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
any of the Amendments that I've seen um
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other amendments that
 
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
anyone has that that we want to talk
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
about repres representative trki you
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment or no
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
coming okay um dealing with what what I
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
would like to do is take up 605 first
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with the ethics um the amendment
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
is for 605 excellent um so let's uh
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
let's jump into the work session um and
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
we can have dueling amendments going
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
here um I have a feeling my prior
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge is that um
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
605 Amendment um 1669 here will take
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
care of yours so yes that's my that's my
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
secret information we'll see um so with
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to hand
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
out and I should explain a little bit
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
too while this is going out the the
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
process that we've gone through um that
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
goes that way this goes that way
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you should be extras if you want to
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
just leave them down at the end rep box
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
if you can leave whatever's extra just
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.990 align:start position:0%
at the
table

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
um are we still missing one or
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
page yeah that's right you would have
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
um the only piece of information after
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the hearing that we had uh a couple
 
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.190 align:start position:0%
the the hearing that we had uh a couple
weeks

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
ago the that was done two or three days
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
prior to the ethics committee meeting um
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
I attended the Ethics Committee uh
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
meeting and they were nice enough to
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
push me to the top of the agenda and we
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you have before you
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.910 align:start position:0%
is a
direct

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
um understanding of what was discussed
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
at that Ethics Committee meeting so the
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
changes that I'll point out to you came
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
from that Ethics Committee meeting um
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
and this will be the first time that
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
them I would I don't have one um
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll first point
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
to the the uh the I think there's four
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
total changes the first is beginning on
 
00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
total changes the first is beginning on
line

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
eight um in the original Bill
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
organizations uh were defined in this
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
section beginning on line
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
five and beginning on line seven they
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
excluded the United States of America
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and a county
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire that was that's
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
where it ended in the original bill this
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
amendment ads or any political
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
subdivision within the state of New
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the reason for that change um
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
was a discussion that our house uh um
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
attorney had with the Senate attorney
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
asking why political subdivisions
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
weren't included in that um that
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
list and the answer was that we received
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
back was well we left them off because
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have qualified anyway
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
because they weren't receiving Financial
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
remuneration by any organization in line
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
13 so he was under the impression that
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
they weren't paid um any of the
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
Selectmen Fire Chiefs and so on all the
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
way down water Commissioners and
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
everything else were it it was his
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
assumption that those positions weren't
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
paid so therefore they wouldn't qualify
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
under this anyway so when it was pointed
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
out that they do get paid in some
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
instances Alderman
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
um it was necessary to add that back in
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why you see or any political
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
subdivision within the state of New
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's change number one and
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make that that
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
one change number two um is just a
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
couple of lines down uh on line 11
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
beginning on line
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
11 this is the um this is the section
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
that says the legislature shall recuse
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
him or herself from participation in any
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
official legislative activity only when
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
the legislator a member of the
 
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.749 align:start position:0%
the legislator a member of the
legislator's

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
legislator's
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
household and then it listed those three
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
items it wasn't n clear in the original
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill to me that you needed to satisfy
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
all of those and so that's change number
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
following change number
 
00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:20.990 align:start position:0%
following change number
three

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if I'm going
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
backwards or forwards here um I included
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
the language um
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
are not limited
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
to on both line
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
19 and
 
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.269 align:start position:0%
19 and
line

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
26 one of them had it
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
originally and one didn't I put it in
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
both of them but I don't remember which
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
one had it
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
original all that is doing obviously is
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
making it clear
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
to the reader
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
that um those aren't um exhaustive lists
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
there are other possibilities that
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
someone could
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
have that's all it does you look you're
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
looking puzzled at me uh representative
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
but um so that's change number change
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
number three and change number
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
four is on the last line of the second
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
page um effective date January 1st
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
2025 that was specifically asked for um
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
by the Ethics Committee I think um
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
reflecting the fact that
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
um and I'm and I'm thinking
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
both the house bill and the Senate
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
Bill both had a 30 days um effective
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
date on it um it was pointed out to me
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
in that ethics meeting that uh there
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
would be some difficulty in in well just
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
for one practical purpose crafting the
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
books for the next legislative session
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
um in time so everything an agreement
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
was made to say January 1st so that it
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
was clear that these were to be in
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
effect for the upcoming legislative
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
session and that's change number four
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what those this amendment
 
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:30.749 align:start position:0%
and that's what those this amendment
does

00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
now um open for conversation questions
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
comments represent D thank you chairman
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
Hill I want to thank you for um having
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
me I just want to clarify something um I
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
will well I will say that your
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion number two which is found on
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
lines 11 and 12 um for the most part
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
meets the amendment that I had had
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
drafted to CL verify the language um on
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
those certain situations where the
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
person would have to recuse themselves
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
can you just for my own information um
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
give me a little more explanation of the
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
first change on um any political
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision within the state of New
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just explain that a little
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
more in depth of what that actually
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
means um sure um it would just as we are
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
excluding um someone that works
 
00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
excluding um someone that works
for

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
um back up just a second this this 65
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
this um Senate
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I liken it I gear it more
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
towards the employer employee
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
relationship than um what we crafted in
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
the house originally um this is this was
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
brought to um the table because of the
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
request um for for an opinion done by
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson primarily and her
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
relationship uh with her employer at uh
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
UNH yes UNH um so what they were trying
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
to do here um if I understand um my the
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
explanation I received is they were
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
trying to exclude from recusal anyone
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
that worked for the uh their employer
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
would be the state the federal
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
government the state of New Hampshire a
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
county and it was their understanding
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
that um because
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
no um Municipal
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
Employee would have qualified
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
anyway um using those uh three
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
qualifiers beginning on line 13 14 and
 
00:18:57.159 --> 00:18:59.230 align:start position:0%
qualifiers beginning on line 13 14 and
15

00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
that there was no need for them to have
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the Municipal Employees included in
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
that uh definition under organization of
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
who was excluded that's my understanding
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question I think
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
so so that line any political
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision is meant to include anyone
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the municipal level that it would
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
qualify to correct great that that seems
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be the the phraseology that we use in
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of places all needed to know thank
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate the time
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
yep yes representative men um
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
so um I have a little bit of a concern
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
about the process um with that third um
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
change that was suggested um which adds
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
but are not limited to um I'm just a bit
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
concerned that if we don't kind of
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
outline these like specific areas of
 
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.350 align:start position:0%
outline these like specific areas of
influence

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
influence
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean would it then be up to the
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
individual member of the general court
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
to say I don't fall in these categories
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to recuse myself or kind
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
of how how does that work on a practical
 
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.029 align:start position:0%
of how how does that work on a practical
level

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
um welcome to legislative Administration
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we have been um dancing around with
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
definitions for three years or so and um
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and it's virtually impossible in in my
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
estimation it's virtually impossible to
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
for us to have listed every possibility
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
of of every case that someone may be
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in reps hall or the Senate
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
chambers that would would fall under
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
that category it
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
so you may look at this as a copout but
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
um it it does
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
serve the purpose of at least alerting
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
people that even though they may not
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
fall into one of the named that they
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
that there are possibilities of other
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
occupations or positions that would also
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
qualify and I think the genius of uh oh
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
I'll hate that'll come back to me
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the lines but um the Gen
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
of um of the drafter of this um was
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
including the title saying facts and
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances tending to show
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
substantial influence
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
um to me that clearly indicates that th
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is not an exhaustive list um these
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
are these are uh every if if I learned
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
one thing in going to ethics committees
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and and listening and reading uh
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
opinions from
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
them it's it's impossible to um foresee
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
every possibility that could come forth
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
so I think this is their best way of
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
doing that okay thank you for clarifying
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
sure yes representative wall thank you
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I appreciate what you just
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
said for clarification because uh the
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee has really struggled
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
with this for a long long time and I
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
agree with the chairman because because
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way we could create a whole
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
laundry list of every position and I
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
think inevitably people will be going to
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
Rich Lambert or or the Ethics Committee
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
to ask for further clarification as time
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
goes by but I think this is as close as
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
we could get at this time thank you
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'll just give you some
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
more of the background here um our
 
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.669 align:start position:0%
more of the background here um our
original

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
goal was to try to create something that
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
someone sitting in section three middle
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
of the row um and a bill is in front of
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
them have the ability to um decide for
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
themselves if there is an issue that
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
they need to recuse themselves for um
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
we've all been in a situation where
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
something a bill comes up that flew
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
under the radar for us personally and
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
didn't know that it was coming up and
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you start thinking gee I
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if I have a problem with this
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
I've said this time and time again if
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
you think you have a problem with this
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
you should recuse yourself that's the uh
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's the catchall um to to me that's
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
how I would operate um having failing
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
that what we started with I think in the
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
very first conversation the very first
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
hearing was a was the idea of perhaps
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
even creating some kind of a decision
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
tree for that for a a new rep coming in
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
and orientation and hand them a tree
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that says if you have issues with you
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
and your employer and you start
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
following down that way and and the same
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
thing if you have individuals in your
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
family that um have employers that may
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
be having um legislation that comes
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
before the before us in committees it
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
there seems to be the a need or desire
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
for that it's very difficult to do um
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
the more we worked with it so um I'm not
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
going to say this is an
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
exhaustive process um and this is the
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
outcome of that I'm going to say these
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
are um two significant steps forward one
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and one in the house um
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
that operate in different areas
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
um there still needs to be further work
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's there are other places we can go
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is darn good as far as I'm
 
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.990 align:start position:0%
this is darn good as far as I'm
concerned

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative evil I think it's darn
 
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
representative evil I think it's darn
good

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
too uh well my day is made I don't know
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
what the rest of you are going to do for
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
the day but my day is made but I just
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
could you um just explain again the
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
rationale for pushing back the effective
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
date I think I followed most of it sure
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind thanks and and and
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
we may want to actually bring in um um
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
more learned uh person from the Ethics
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
Committee actually we have on our our
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
committee a member of the Ethics
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
Committee but uh you came in I'm not
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
sure for this part of the conversation
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh the other day um they just uh they
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
just assumed um right from the jump that
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
um a 30-day effective date um was going
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
to be it was 60 in the original I
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
apologize I'll take that back 60 days um
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
they thought that that was going to be
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
um unworkable from their standpoint from
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee standpoint and and
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
it seemed from that conversation that
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
their goal was always um or they thought
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
our goal should be to have this ready
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
for the next legislative session um and
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
then I think it was Mr Lambert that
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
brought up the idea that yes we' have to
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
have new um guidelines printed and there
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
was some discussion over the color um
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's purple or not and um and
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
and so they were thinking that if they
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
could get this um ready for January 1st
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
that would be the acceptable date
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
um I also upon the drive home started
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
wondering I wonder if also there may be
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
some concern with the um the ethics
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
cases that they have before them now um
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
um applying that to it um anything that
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
changes um in the interim so that's
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I that part was not
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
brought up that was just from my own
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
head on the way home but I know when you
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
start changing rules Midstream there's
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes problems and and even having
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
this discussion in ethics knowing that
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
there were petitioners well I don't know
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
if that's what they're called but
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
um already there to talk about their
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
cases I'm sure they would be thinking
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
about how that affects their case any of
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
the changes that are that are coming
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
forth so it um truly I did not question
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
them on the on the January 1 date any
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
further because to me it is designed for
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
the next legislature not this
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
legislature so I had no re problem with
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
it representative I was speaking with
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
representative evil earlier and my only
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
question would be would there be a need
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
for this to be um go into effect for
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
organization day since we're all sworn
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
in the month
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
prior I don't want to I don't want to
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
Mud The Waters I'm just yeah I the
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
reality is we're sworn in as as
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives on December this coming
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
year um I'm getting a headshake no uh
 
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.070 align:start position:0%
year um I'm getting a headshake no uh
from

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
Mr lamber can you maybe jump on the
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
sit reluctantly even I think the biggest
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
reason for holding back is because the
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
statute requires that the guidelines be
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
consistent with the statute and so we
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
need to amend the guidelines which is a
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
process in and of itself we'll probably
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
just in the past we've just
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
almost verbatim Incorporated any sort of
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
statutory change into the guidelines but
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
decisions would have to be made as to
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
where exactly the guidelines that would
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
go and language has to be agreed upon
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
and then the house and the Senate must
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
approve that
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment so um I don't know if they'd
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
be willing to do that on any sort of
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
veto day in the past that's not been the
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
case when
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
um when is that accepting
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
done in relation to organization day is
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
that done on or I my memory is not what
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
it used to be when do we normally accept
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
the guidelines when you vote on the
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
rules because the rules incorporate the
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that's the that's January
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
so process process is everything thanks
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that helps thank you oh
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
also the all of our opinions and
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted rulings need to be reviewed
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
because um some of them give guidance
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
which we don't no longer would apply for
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
example the interpreted ruling in the
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
back of the booklet is all about
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest and so that should
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
be added into that um a provision about
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
when recusal is
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
required and they probably perhaps
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
they'll be an additional interpretive
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
ruling that would help be something
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
short and just about this that also
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
could be something that would be helpful
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
so all those things have to be done by
 
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.029 align:start position:0%
so all those things have to be done by
the

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
committee I think I actually should have
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
just had you come to the table first
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
rather than me stumbl through it I think
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
that would have been a smarter move live
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
and learn thank you can you hold for
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
just a second see if there's any other
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
questions I was just going to say though
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
before that's January works because
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's when we actually vote on the
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
things the house rules and and all those

we're it's just us here we're not
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
talking to anybody else so um what what
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
I've also done
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
taken this language um in this
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and asked the drafting
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
attorney to assume this language passes
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
as is and then give me a um welcome
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
representative not take any any seat is
 
00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:59.950 align:start position:0%
representative not take any any seat is
fine

00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
um and then give me back a merged
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
version of the house ped position for um
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
what the Senate has the our ethics our
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
house version of the ethics
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
Bill and this 605 Senate version as
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
amended with what I just gave you and
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
and and my like my likening is make this
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
a zipper so that we have one document
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
that um is containing the information
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
from both the house and the Senate
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
versions and the reason I did it was so
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have conflicts between
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
what 14
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
c44a said in one version versus what 14
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
CA ver Roman a said on the not Roman a
 
00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:00.110 align:start position:0%
CA ver Roman a said on the not Roman a
14

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
C4 d a said in the Senate version so
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
this is her attempt at that I'm not
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
sure whether that um clarifies or not
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's more done for me for a process um
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
or a a belt and suspenders approach
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
might thought is that if I could get
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
um this over to or have this in one
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
document then I don't almost care
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
whether the Senate tables our house
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
version or not or something we have one
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill that has both things in it and and
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
the house would be in control of of this
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
ethics package from the house and the
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
Senate so that's what this is um I'm
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
happy to hand it out or just have
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
discussions on it or anything
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
else that we have yes so essentially
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying uh the Senate is having
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're having we hope um so
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
that whichever version is adopted
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
reflects the other one where's the other
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
actually I have had thank you for the
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
question um because I have had
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Senate chair um
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
who has our house version and it is not
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
their intention obviously to not deal
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
with it um they intend to stranger
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
things have happened
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
so um what I hoped to do after this
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had is provide a
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
copy to the chair of the Ethics
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
Committee and let him amend or decide
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
whether he wants to amend the house
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
version to this so that it has both the
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
House and Senate
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
because these two don't work um in
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
opposite ways they they cover different
 
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
areas of the ethics um laws so one as I
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier 605 deals more with
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
the employer employee relationship the
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
house version works more with the
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
individual personal um or in financial
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
benefits from a legislator so they're
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
not in they're not doing opposite things
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing s um simultaneously
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing different things so to me
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that at some point we're
 
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
going to have these merged I was going
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
to see if we could just pass it in that
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
version in both the House and Senate off
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
the bat so representative tki um do you
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
know off the top of your head the bill
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
number on the house version I was just
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
going to pull it up so I can see what
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we heard that they're having
 
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
and I think we heard that they're having
that

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
hearing May 8th which
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
is what's that May 8th 9:30 in the
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
morning I think at State House 100 oh
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not I'm not aware um when I
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
spoke with the chair he wasn't sure when
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
he was going to have the hearing so but
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
but that's what this is if anyone
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
wants it or whether I I don't know
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
whether we should just set it aside and
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
know that if the House and Senate passes
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
it um this is what it'll ultimately look
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
like more than likely um or whether we
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
should uh take it up in exec session and
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
and pass it and then provide them a copy
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
of it um in the hearing on May
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
8th representative evil
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't mind taking a look at it I
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
mean basically what you're saying is
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
it's a mashup of 1388 and 65 but
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
nothing's really changed nothing changed
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
unless there was a mistake or something
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah only the only um and maybe um
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
our researcher can well I don't know if
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
you've had a conversation with OSS
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
attorney or not about it no okay um the
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
only thing that I was concerned about is
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I didn't want one bill in some
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
area to conflict with another or not
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
make it possible to work um that's all I
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
was trying to do and try to do it in
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
advance rather than get to a point where
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
we passed them both and then find that
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
we either have to come back to do
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
something so that they actually fit
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
together I was trying to be proactive
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's all but yep I'm happy to hand it
 
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.710 align:start position:0%
that's all but yep I'm happy to hand it
out

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
time and I did confirm that the changes
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we just talked about are in this
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
one so it's it's
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
actually because we haven't voted on
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
those that Amendment yet um and I and I
 
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.069 align:start position:0%
those that Amendment yet um and I and I
think

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
I need
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
to I think I need to confirm with
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
representative tki um do we want to did
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
I go out of order should I have should I
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
have brought up the amendment that you
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
have here or is is that pretty much Tak
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
care thanks for your consideration I I
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
think with um my ranking members
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
approval that my amendment has been
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
absorbed into your first one okay all
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
right do you agree Mr chairman y uh may
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
I ask a question absolutely you thank
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
you very much didn't you want to add the
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
word and at the end of her it's
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
understood but it's better to clarify it
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
I can I can show you the what the
 
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.950 align:start position:0%
I can I can show you the what the
language

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
is I'm not sure well I guess if we're
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually drafting another amendment and
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
merging both and there's any tweaks made
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
all right I will pass this out just so
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
the clarification there was an extra and
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's it oh okay in the in the
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
section um where that's Incorporated on
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
change number two it yes change number
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
two if you look at line oh there is an
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
and after Roman two right there's a and
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
after line 14 I my draft has an and
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
after line 13 and it just says all of
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
the following so it be receives
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
Financial REM a from an organization and
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
holds a position to Expo and it's one
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
and however if there is going to be
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
another draft that would be the only
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
change yep I
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
I will say I did review this as best I
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
um Keener eyes than mine to make sure
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
that um something wasn't either
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
duplicated or dropped
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
or but but this is a uh an easy way to
 
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.550 align:start position:0%
or but but this is a uh an easy way to
do

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
it Mr chairman yeah could you just point
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
out the end of the first bill in the
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
beginning no you can't okay no because
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
they're truly a zipper oh well then I'm
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
not going to be much help well this is
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying it's very hard to do um
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
sure um as I told you our original goal
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
was to make this uh and getting to
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative menal bomb's point to get
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
this to the point where um the average
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
person could read this in section
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
three I'm not sure where where they yet
 
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.430 align:start position:0%
three I'm not sure where where they yet
but

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
um but it
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
does as far as I can see and the places
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
that I looked it does incorporate all of
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
spots repr yeah Mr Lambert Mr
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
chairman I see a possible conflict um on
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
page one line 31 the word
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
only which line 31 you say yes the word
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
only so that part was language from
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
605 yeah so those are the only
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances where recusal is required
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
right later on there are other
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances where recusal is required
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
and I did mention this to the vice chair
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
the other day that it it does seem when
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
you merge these things like like we have
 
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.750 align:start position:0%
you merge these things like like we have
done

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
um it would seem that something like
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
that would pop up that we didn't
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate when we drafted the house
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
that there would be a senate version so
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
um that that's one of them
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
does I agree with you that it could
 
00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:21.710 align:start position:0%
does I agree with you that it could
potentially

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
my only thought is if we're GNA all go
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
through this super carefully we might
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
not be able do it I know that's what I
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
wondered as well um I think it's a great
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
idea but yeah and and more from a
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
procedural standpoint than anything else
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
because it um I think it would save an
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
awful lot of floor time either in the
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate if all one or the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
other group was doing was standing up
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
and saying the Senate has already passed
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the combination bill so it renders ours
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
move we don't need to we don't need to
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
vote on this that saves or the reverse
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
if the house has pass both of them that
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
incorporated the changes in both were
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
done um procedurally it's just a cleaner
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
way to do it but I agree with the
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
interest of time it may not be the
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
although if it's something as simple as
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if that would be
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
picked up in enroll bills or not um
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
I you
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
know it it
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
seems I don't know maybe it's too clever
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
know we can do whatever you'd like um
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
why don't
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
we could you check to see if we have the
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
amendment yet on
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
um on the Marthur Fuller Clark bill
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
which number escapes
 
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.349 align:start position:0%
which number escapes
me

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
want I was trying to do it but the the
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
numbering has changed and it's not the
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
language is here's here's how I finally
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
looked at it it seemed to me the
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
language is all the same it's the
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
placement that was different so um I'm
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
not sure that there's anything more
 
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.390 align:start position:0%
not sure that there's anything more
than

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know um Deep In The Weeds uh
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
conversation than than it is Mr chairman
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
basis yep I think maybe some of the
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
confusion might be that we have the
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
Preamble in this and didn't have it in
 
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment so they're having trouble
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
placing that so um yeah that's a good
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
point um all of line one through
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
line well 16 I guess um is the language
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
from the original House bill that
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
um that were the findings in other words
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the purpose that was um that comes
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
from the original not from Senate Bill
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
605 so um essentially Mr chairman that's
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
the preamble to the bill just so people
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:12.109 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes on the original 1388 yep rep conable
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
sorry no no you're fine uh it's just a
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
minor minor thing on page two line six
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
um rightfully we don't have to recuse
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
ourselves for the budget but it says
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
shall not recuse and I'm one of those
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
shall means you must so shall not recuse
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
is telling me that I'm not allowed to
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
recuse myself on on you know what I'm
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
not that's already in the that should be
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
brought up next on May 8th in the uh
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
Senate version really yeah like it's
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
it's just to me I think it's just a
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
clerical legislator shall not recuse him
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
from the budget is saying I'm not
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to recuse myself from the budget
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.670 align:start position:0%
 
himself

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm um you laugh but but in review of
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
all of the other states that um that Jen
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
put together for us more often than not
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
that is what they are doing is is making
 
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:36.190 align:start position:0%
that is what they are doing is is making
them

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.069 align:start position:0%
them
yeah

00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
yep would you mind thank
 
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.510 align:start position:0%
yep would you mind thank
you

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
um I uh I think I'm of the mind and I'll
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
see what everyone thinks I'm of the mind
 
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
to set as side this amendment um and and
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
just deal with the original amendment
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
that we dealt with and and not bother
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
trying to be clever and merge these
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
things together where where is everybody
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
that bring I that would work I mean I
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
could easily drop this on them and say
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
by the way um here's what we've done in
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee it wouldn't have passed the
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
house by then but here's for your
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
own usage yeah and that gives more time
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
for other people to look at it I guess
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay see this is why we do work sessions
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
um all right I uh what is our plan right
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
now the plan is we have one more um one
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
more Amendment coming on the other Bill
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'm putting aside 605 for right now I
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
think we beat that horse um but thank
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lambert um you're free to go um
 
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.069 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lambert um you're free to go um
the

00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh I will describe for you the amendment
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
um and then follow up with the when the
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
copies come um so on the other bill um
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
331a that as you may or may not be aware
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
um was to authorize the historical
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee to accept a portrait of uh
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha Fuller Clark and hang it
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the state house um it has been
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
pointed out to us uh several times by
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
several different people that the
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
historical committee would like the
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
discretion of being able to hang things
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
things where they where they choose um I
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
guess in the interest of space Andor I
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what else um so I went to OS
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
originally with the amendment to just
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
change that state house to simply saying
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the joint
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
historical committee the hanging would
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
be uh overseen by the by The Joint
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
historical committee while I was there I
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
tacked on um an
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
acceptance and mirrored the language of
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
the um of the Martha F Clark line and
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
just said the joint historical committee
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
um is authorized to accept a portrait of
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.510 align:start position:0%
um is authorized to accept a portrait of
Wentworth

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
Wentworth
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
cheswell um and oversee the hanging at
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
their discretion
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
um in the State House complex or
 
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
something like that so that's all that
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment has it's just those two
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
lines and then an effective date I guess
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
um but um if anyone wants background on
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
why we put in um when we're cheswell um
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
I think that was in the prior term was
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
it it wasn't last year was it prior term
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
yes you do so so um for those that
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
aren't aware Wentworth cheswell is in
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
some circles um called um the um the
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
black Paul reir um is one thing he was
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
known for there's other groups that um
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
believe and this is uh questioned I
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
guess um whether he was the first
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
elected official um first black uh
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
elected official in the United States um
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
and yet um we had a bill two terms ago
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
that ran into difficulty the house
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
passed it it went to the Senate the
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
senate had difficulty with it um for two
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
reasons one that we were being asked to
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
it um there are there more oh you have
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
some over there
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the original bill that the
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
legislature was being asked to pay for
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
the uh commissioning of a of a portrait
 
00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
the uh commissioning of a of a portrait
um

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that was one issue the senate had
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
the second issue was they didn't believe
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
it was brought up in testimony that they
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
didn't believe that there was a a
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
picture of uh ww worth cheswell that
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
they could replicate for a portrait so
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
um they substituted and sent back to us
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment to turn the portrait into a
 
00:53:52.359 --> 00:53:54.030 align:start position:0%
an amendment to turn the portrait into a
plaque

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
plaque
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
um that didn't sit well with this
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
committee and um I think we even went to
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference over it um to
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
say what are you thinking and um and it
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
ended up dying with no one signing off
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the bill so this is a way of bringing
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
it back uh to the attention of um of of
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
us um and say that we do think that
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
there should be some portrait of the um
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
of Wentworth cheswell um hung somewhere
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the state house or hung somewhere in
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
the State House complex so that's uh
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment in front of
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
you does you can see that um lines 11
 
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.470 align:start position:0%
you does you can see that um lines 11
through

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
14 um mirror lines three through six
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
except for the names
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative W thank you Mr chairman
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for all that you've been
 
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for all that you've been
offering

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
offering
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I will say that we met with Senator
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
Susie this morning who said that
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
actually the Martha F Clark portrait ran
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
into some bumps in the Senate which
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
surprised me um I'm holy in favor of of
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
the legislation for us to accept the
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
portrait and or direct the historic
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee to accept the portrait I serve
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
on that committee um the committee has
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
to choose where can be
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
displayed and right now a lot of the
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
portraits are being rearranged in the
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
state house uh according to certain
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
priorities and we don't know in the
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
future what will be happening uh with
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
the various portraits and such um but
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying very hard to recognize
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
women in the state house at this point
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm fully in favor of the bill for
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
Marth 4: CL when it comes to adding WTH
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
cheswell we're fulfilling a commitment
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
that this committee made uh I believe
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
two years ago um because WTH jeswell I I
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
do have some facts on him yes he's known
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
as the black Paul Riv he was the first
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
elected person actually um they called
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
him a molato um because of his skin
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
color at the time uh but he was the
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
first of color to be elected to any
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
office in this country um what was chz
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
was a significant individual from New
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
Market there is a state plaque on a
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
stand in New Market near his grave uh I
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
remember one time when we were working
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill I went to the
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
research office and all four researchers
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked with me diligently one whole
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon trying to find some picture of
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
wentw ches and we I remember running up
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
to Paul Smith and saying hey we at least
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
have a picture of a descendant of his
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
near descendant you know one generation
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
down um all we're asking for is a
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
likeness of him um trying to come close
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
at least this gentleman really really
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognized um because he was the first
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
personal color in the whole country and
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire uh he was a
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
Mason uh he had a very distinguished
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
career well educated came from a good
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
family and certainly does deserve
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
recognition I don't have copies of what
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
I have here on him to hand out today but
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just reminding the committee
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we were committed to doing
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
something with this so I'm I I was I'm
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment because I'm
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
totally in favor of the Martha F Clark
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
portrait coming forward uh for those who
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it in some room I think
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's State House 102 it's Donna suusi a
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
senator Donna susi's office um it is
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
really a fine fine portrait and she did
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
accomplish a lot here but it is up to
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the historic committee to figure out
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
where to place it once we give them
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
authority to accept it um we're still
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
having some concern about a portrait of
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
w was jezell but there are people a lot
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
of people came and testified in favor of
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
the portrait we will not be paying for
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
it um I don't know if the offer still
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
stands it does Paul Smith is a Mason and
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
he's saying that the Masons will pay for
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
this so it's no obligation financially
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
to the state so I will support that as
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%

kind of difficulty in the Senate um with
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
the mark clerk I thought that I I

thought everyone signed on to it
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%

raised about uh frequency of changing
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
where the portraits are and this that
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the other umot lot of the portraits
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
were just put up by someone's judgment
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
back when without a lot of consultation
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
with the historic committee I'm not even
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure the joint historic committee
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
existed way back when um great thought
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
respect and consideration is given to
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
where the portraits are hung and we
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
don't get them that often uh most
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
recently we had the portrait of merilla
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
Ricker uh donated to the state it is at
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state house she was the first woman
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
who ever ran for governor she didn't
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
qualify to vote because she died just
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
before women got the right to vote
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's hanging on the first floor of the
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
state house um if anyone has any
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns about where uh
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha Fuller Clark's portrait
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
might be displayed uh they're welcome to
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
come to the Joint historic committee and
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
express opinions and I think that would
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
be very welcome um it's a bipartisan
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%

legislation we do have however a couple
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
of um probably impromptu meetings coming
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
up uh one is going to be if any of these
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
um are changed and we need Concur and
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%

01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
existing bills that are over in the

Senate that we're working on legislative
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
youth advisory council is still being
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
worked on on um the others lose me
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
else um so this isn't going to be the
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%

substitutes who came in today it was
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
really good of all of you to show up um
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's kind of tough showing up in a
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
different committee and getting up to
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
speed on the issues but you did it and
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
you did it beautifully I want to thank
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
the staff also and thank our our
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
leadership on the committee thank
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
you uh I Echo um our our staff is
 
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
phenomenal um I I actually
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
thought this is probably more than you
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
ever want to know I actually thought we
 
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
were in deep trouble when we lost Pam
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
smling as our researcher
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
um uh it it's a and one a and 1B I think
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
is what we have a very fine researcher
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
that has helped us enormously here um
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
likewise we also have a committee
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
assistant that has been very helpful I
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
always think some of this is good when
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's seen and not heard and everything
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
just moves smoothly sometimes that's the
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
best for as a assistant but our
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
researcher is
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
spectacular um I hate saying that
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
because now somebody will try to steal
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
her so that's not not good um anything
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
else that anyone else wants to bring up
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
any other concerns comments questions
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none um we are done for the day
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
have a nice
