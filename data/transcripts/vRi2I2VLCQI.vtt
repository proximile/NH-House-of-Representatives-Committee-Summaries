and I'm Ben Frost Deputy executive
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
director of Manchester
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
we have a few comments to get started if
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
you'd like sure okay well thank you very
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
much for having us this morning uh for
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know New
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing was established by
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
state law in 1981 when the governor and
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
legislature at the time saw the need for
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
uh entity to help meet the housing needs
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the state to the extent that they
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
weren't being met by the private market
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
and so we've worked for more than 40
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
years to do that to run programs uh that
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
Finance multi-family affordable housing
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
provide rental assistance help
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
first-time homebuyers get into their
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
first homes and otherwise help people to
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
be consistent with that that mandate
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
that we were given
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
I will uh so I'm we're here to speak
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
about the uh recommended appropriation
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's in Senate Bill 231 uh I'll start
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
by saying that as an instrumentality of
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state we don't really see it as our
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
role to advocate for or ask for money
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
we're not a state agency and we don't
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
get any operating money uh from the
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
state but to the extent that the state
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
sees a need for Solutions uh for
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
problems that are facing uh Granite
 
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.569 align:start position:0%
problems that are facing uh Granite
Staters

00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:46.579 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
specific to housing we're here to help
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that we help is to
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
administer the affordable housing fund
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
so I will just speak for two or three
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
minutes about four key characteristics
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
of the affordable housing fund uh to
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
help I hope inform your decisions
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh so one characteristic of the
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund that we
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
particularly appreciate in doing our
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
work is its flexibility and I will say
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does get money from the
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
federal government to help Finance
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and we administer
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
most of it and we do our darndest to
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's we make maximum
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and impact for every
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
dollar that comes from the federal
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
government to New Hampshire for housing
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
purposes but it's not always easy
 
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:25.700 align:start position:0%
because it comes wrapped in all kinds of
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
layers of bureaucratic regulations and
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
policy mandates that have been layered
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
on over the years and it doesn't always
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
make it a good fit for the work that the
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
people on the ground are doing to serve
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's most vulnerable
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
residents and that's why some of the
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
finance some of the projects that we
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
financed over the years that we think
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
are most impactful and most squarely
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
aimed at the needs of the the people who
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
need it most uh wouldn't have been
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
possible without the affordable housing
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
fund and some of those are highlighted
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
in the handout that we've given you I'll
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
mention 434 Union Street in Manchester
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
for people who have experienced
 
00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:01.130 align:start position:0%
for people who have experienced
homelessness

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.970 align:start position:0%
homelessness
um

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan house in Claremont which we did
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the county for
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
people exiting incarceration with
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders I'll also
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
mention though it's not in the handout
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
Compass House in Laconia Ruth driven
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
place in Portsmouth I think that is
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
there is a picture of that one and
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
Bridge Street recovery housing in uh
 
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
Bridge Street recovery housing in uh
Bennington

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
Bennington
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
again these are very important don't
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
happen to fit well with Federal funding
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
and and probably wouldn't have been
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
possible without the resource that is
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
second characteristics I want to mention
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
is recyclability and I'm not exactly
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
sure if that's a word but what I mean by
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
it is all affordable housing fund pretty
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
much goes in as a loan and it's not like
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
a hard bank loan where if you don't make
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
your payments every month somebody
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
starts to foreclose on you no payments
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
are are due unless the project is
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
spinning off cash which does happen from
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
time to time with affordable housing
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
funds sometimes that's because the owner
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
or property manager has succeeded in
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
securing a Federal grant to subsidize
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
People's rent and the operations of the
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
property and when that happens when
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
those properties make money every dollar
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
of that uh of that cash goes back into
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund to help fund
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
future affordable housing projects in
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and so uh
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably my favorite thing
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
about the fund to be honest I think
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
Appropriations over the years have
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
totaled something around 62 million
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
dollars we've deployed substantially
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
more than that to fund housing in New
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now we're averaging uh
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
something north of a million dollars
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 1.4 million per year in
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
repayments that we put right back into
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
the state and affordable housing
 
00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:35.090 align:start position:0%
the state and affordable housing
projects

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
third thing I'll mention is process
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
we've got a team of housing
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
professionals with combined centuries of
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
experience in underwriting and reviewing
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing deals and we ensure
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
that enough money goes into these deals
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their well-built
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
adequately capitalized with reserves to
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're well kept make their
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods better they're places that
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
people are proud to call home but no
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
more than that and what I mean by that
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
is no dollar of affordable housing has
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
been used or would be used to enrich a
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
project that was going to happen anyway
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that takes a lot of work to ensure
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
that we can make that statement I'm
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
we're proud to be able to make it
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
fourth and final thing I'll mention is
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
true long-term affordability and by long
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
term I mean at least 20 years that's
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
what the statute says it has to be in
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
practice depending on the other programs
 
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
that the properties are making use of
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
many of uh the properties that we
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
Finance are affordable to for 40 to 60
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
years and we have a team of compliance
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
professionals that go out and check on
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
the property every year two or three
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
years to ensure that they're being
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
managed in compliance with those
 
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.250 align:start position:0%
managed in compliance with those
commitments

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh by true affordability what I mean is
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
these are subject to not only rent
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
restrictions but income restrictions so
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's common for affordable housing
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
programs to ensure that the rent is
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
limited to something that's affordable
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
to people working people people who are
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
not rich uh this is also uh to ensure
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
that it's rent these apartments are
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
actually rented to people who are Income
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
qualified and I think that's an
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
important characteristic as well
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
so once again we really appreciate your
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
time we'd be happy to answer any
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them and we hope
 
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
I want to add to what Rob said he
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned Senate Bill 231 uh that the
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
same appropriation and language is
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
included in House Bill 2 on page 20 uh
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah since you've gone to a house bill
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
too I I know we have some questions
 
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.629 align:start position:0%
too I I know we have some questions
about

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire and then there's uh
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
number 47 also on page 20.
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund how to do
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
those two impact you at all do you get
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
any of your funding from those two
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
sources or those proposed to sources
 
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:12.740 align:start position:0%
because they're both general fund
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
Appropriations this time
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
so invest New Hampshire is I guess
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
similar in purpose but different in
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
terms of the administration of the fund
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
that's not administered by New Hampshire
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
housing that's the beer uh uh division
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
of business and economic Affairs that
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
administers those funds so if you're not
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
Central but that can be used for
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing too right yes I can
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought
 
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
and then the other question was which
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
respects to line 69 the affordable
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
housing fund is that I'm sorry 25
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
million on line 40 or line seven
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
section 47. yeah so that's that's the
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund and I I spent
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
all my time talking about the affordable
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
housing fund which is the fund that New
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing administers
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
so the comments that I made are specific
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
to to that 25 million dollar
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation and may not be applicable
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the contemplated invest NH
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation or the other elements of
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that so far most of
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
your not all your funding has been
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
Federal but this would be General funds
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
the 25 000 that you would have access to
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say that uh most of our I
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
mean I would say yes most of our funding
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
but not all of our funding so the
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund was created soon
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
after New Hampshire housing was created
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
and has received Appropriations from
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
time to time over the years totaling uh
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
is it 62 million dollars
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
all right representative Sweeney I
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe has a question thank you very
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman thank you both for
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
being here today I have a curiosity
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
mainly on the projects that you do
 
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.970 align:start position:0%
mainly on the projects that you do
Finance

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
say if a developer wanted to build the
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
first floor as retail and then floors
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
two through five are going to be
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
do you work with the developer on saying
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to help Finance the
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
construction of two through five and
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
you're on your own for floor one or is
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
it strictly just buildings that are all
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
housing you know that kind of mixed use
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh is allowed and so Bradley Commons and
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
Dover uh there's one in uh uh Nashua
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's under construction now those are
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
projects generally there's a condominium
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
structure so they get a commercial loan
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the commercial space and then we
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
just Finance the housing portion of it
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up and maybe a rough estimation
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
in your view what what's the number of
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
missing units that we have in New
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to meet our demand
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
we are about to release a Statewide
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
housing needs assessment so we've been
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
working on for the past year and that
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
will indicate that we we estimate that
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
there is a current shortage that is to
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
meet current demand of about 23 000
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
units Statewide that does not account
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
for future growth and future need that's
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
just current need
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin followed by
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
you guys seem to have
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
the statistics on housing in the state
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you study them closely
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
I served on a now defunct commission
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
called uh
 
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.890 align:start position:0%
called uh
the

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:20.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
commission on New Hampshire demographics
 
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:28.940 align:start position:0%
and part of that Commission
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
looked at housing
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
this legislative
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
passed the law
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
provided for accessory dwellings
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
on the I guess some of the theory that
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
people would build an accessory drowling
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
dwelling maybe for their in-laws
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
and in time that accessory dwelling
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
might might end up being affordable
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
housing do you have any statistics of at
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
all on whether that theory has been
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
successful or not intuitively it seems
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
like it should have been successful
 
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.590 align:start position:0%
like it should have been successful
uh

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative this is an excellent
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
question and the the answer is yes and
 
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
question and the the answer is yes and
no

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um the the yes part of it is that we
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
hear a lot from different communities
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
about what is happening there so places
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
like Portsmouth and Merrimack and Dover
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
they tell us what the the permitting is
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
that's going on with accessory dwelling
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
units but there's no Central repository
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
in the State uh for these kinds of
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
Records you'd have to go to each
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
municipality and look at their building
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
permit uh data and sometimes that's
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
available in their annual reports but
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's not universally available the
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
office of planning and development in
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Business and economic
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
Affairs does do an annual Municipal
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
survey and they ask municipalities about
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
their ordinances but they don't ask them
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
about the building permits that are
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
issued pursuant to those ordinances so I
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
think I think you're right that
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
intuitively we would say it has had an
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
impact but we don't have really hard
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
numbers on it yet this but this is this
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
question keeps coming up and we
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that it would be helpful if we
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
could do some more research on this and
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
well that's that's kind of what I
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
thought and I thought by asking the
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
question I might
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
stimulate the interests to get an answer
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so noted
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm the invest and the H
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
when when those folks were here we asked
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
them specifically could the same develop
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
or apply for both sets of funds and they
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
said yes do you have any reason to say
 
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.130 align:start position:0%
said yes do you have any reason to say
no

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
I don't that's true
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
I see and so would that affect the
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
amount that if you knew somebody was
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
getting these other funds would that
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
affect what how much you give them of
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
your funds or exactly yes and that's
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's the underwriting process that I
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
referred to when I was talking about our
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
process so we would uh reserve a certain
 
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299 align:start position:0%
amount of funds if that developer went
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
out and got money from any other source
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
including invest NH prior to closing on
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
the real estate transaction we would
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
review their sources of funds and
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
there's no way to hide them and we would
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of public subsidy that
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
is going into that into that project I
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
mean we see that as an important part of
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
our our responsibility as stewards of
 
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
so would there be any gain if all the
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
money was in one program or the other as
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to this kind of scattered
 
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.810 align:start position:0%
opposed to this kind of scattered
method

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
I mean they're both grants right they're
 
00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
I mean they're both grants right they're
both

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
for similar purposes well ours are not
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
technically grants they're loans that
 
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
are recycled back into the affordable
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
housing fund oh I see uh so whether
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit to you know putting
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
all the money into one versus another uh
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's sort of a policy
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
decision for New Hampshire housing to
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
really weigh in on I mean I guess I
 
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:20.059 align:start position:0%
would say that they're aimed at
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
overlapping but slightly different
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
problems where the invest NH funds have
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
less uh Less in the way of affordability
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
requirements on them and so I think
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
you're unlikely to see invest in age
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
financing something like
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
um you know the recovery housing the
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
housing for people who are exiting
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
incarceration or who have experienced
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh it's pretty much all
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
sort of higher uh higher income but but
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
still with some restrictions on it
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
and as I said there's overlap
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
um and representative require one thing
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
I would add is that that the the way
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
these two programs have been
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
administered is somewhat different for
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
one statutorily the affordable housing
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
fund was created by the legislature in
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
1988. we are allowed to do grants or
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
loans we only do loans because we
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of bringing
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
that money back and reusing it and we've
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
done a substantial amount of that
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing is that
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
um that the targeting is different so as
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
as Rob said uh invest in h it applies to
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
a much uh greater range of incomes we
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
are limited by what you have told us in
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
statute uh we can use the the affordable
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
housing fund for
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
and invest in H has used that as Bea has
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
used the invest NH funding from arpa uh
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
to essentially Move Along projects that
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
are already well on their way they're
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
essentially shovel ready we use the
 
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:54.740 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund to
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
finance projects from the beginning that
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
probably otherwise would not happen
 
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.310 align:start position:0%
probably otherwise would not happen
listen

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
listen
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you further yes so if we did not
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
give you this 25 million since you have
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
loan funds and they're being paid back
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
you're going to make new loans yeah so
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
how much what would your activity be uh
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
would be substantially less I mean we
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
would still have access to the federal
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit and other federal
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
funds but you know I think that we uh in
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
a typical year Finance 500 to a thousand
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
new units and that wide variability just
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
has to do with timing and the long
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
gestation period for multi-family
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
housing I would say without this 25
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars we would be a lot closer
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
to the 500 or somewhere south of 500
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
whereas with it I think we could uh be
 
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:46.940 align:start position:0%
much closer to the 1000 units Finance
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I guess the question is
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
what's the balance that you have
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
available to loan right right now uh
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's about five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
oh I see so as soon as you get a dollar
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
you will own it yes yeah I mean we have
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
a robust pipeline of developers who want
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
to develop affordable housing but the
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
resources aren't there we're well
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed in terms of uh projects
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
let me ask it a different way how much
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
how many how much repayment are you
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
getting every year
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh so it's is it 1.4 million that we
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
looked at over the last few years seven
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
years the average over the last seven
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
years is about 1.4 million yeah oh very
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.610 align:start position:0%
years is about 1.4 million yeah oh very
tiny

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
tiny
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you say it's tiny keep
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
in mind that over the last 30 plus years
 
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
we've received Appropriations totaling
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
62 million dollars so it's not like
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
we've received 25 million dollars in
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
each appropriation and I would also say
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
because we underwrite these pretty
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
rigorously it is not typical for them to
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
spin off a lot of cash it's only when
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
they do that some of that cash comes
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
back into the affordable housing fund so
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
I wish that it were the kind of
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund that was truly
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and you could just get
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
it up and right are you saying it's not
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
a mortgage
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
it is it we have a mortgage and a lien
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
on the property and we use that to uh
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
sort of enforce the affordability but we
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
do not it's not the kind of Home
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
Mortgage that I have where I make a
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
payment to the bank every month and if I
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't they foreclose on me
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
that is to say it's non-amortizing yes
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
we don't expect regular payments on the
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
mortgage but the mortgage as an
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
instrument is there to protect our but
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
there's not a fixed term of 20 years or
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
something and and you're going to get
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the whole thing in that period of time
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
the law requires us to have a fixed term
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
of at least 20 years so we do have that
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh but they it as Rob said sometimes
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's cash in the project and we will
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
take a portion of that and sometimes the
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
projects are refinanced at which time
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
the money would come back to the
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
affordable housing Fund in full okay
 
00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:47.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin please thank you
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.789 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
um

00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
did I hear you correctly to say that you
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
believe that this section 47 is a mirror
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
it it is representative uh the and I'll
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
note that there is a an amendment that
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance has right now which we
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
expect to move forward the amendment is
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
has been proffered by Senators Rosenwald
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
and Ennis uh that would change the bill
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
as introduced to reflect that it should
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
be the funds the 25 million would be
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
coming out of FY 23 Surplus as is shown
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. so the Senate bill as
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
introduced had it coming out of the the
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium this would be coming
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
out of surplus so it's not a duplication
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
I take it right this this 25 million is
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
the same 25 million the senates talking
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
about we expect both Chambers to treat
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
Melissa we don't need it today but if
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
you get us a copy of 231 please at some
 
00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:08.690 align:start position:0%
you get us a copy of 231 please at some
point

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure would you like paper copies I
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
believe I sent it out yesterday oh I
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to see it with all the
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails that we received
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:26.299 align:start position:0%
do with that okay
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
so I have a
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
a quick question where did the 25
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars come from because one of
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
your responses to representative
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question was you have about
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
500 000 in there now I believe which
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of money so I'm curious why
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
the ask of 25 million do you have a
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
place for that or is that just a number
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
that you thought might be a good number
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
to choose
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
well we did not come up with a number
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
so we we do not ask the legislature for
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
funding that's the role of advocacy
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
organizations and legislators who are
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
interested in this uh we understand that
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
the the governor put it in into his
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
budget so we'll take him as a strong
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for this
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and we recognize that the Senate is
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
is looking at this the same way
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so we it would go to the affordable
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
housing fund which is a specific Fund in
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
statute administered by New Hampshire
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
housing so your group specifically
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
didn't obviously Lobby for this with the
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
governor as something that somebody else
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
did I guess correct okay
 
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair to your question about whether
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have a place for it we certainly do I
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
mean we have a pipeline that would is
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
nearly double this in terms of projects
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
that are on the boards and waiting to go
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
forward not every one of them will
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes they hit snags with permitting
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
or other construction costs that are
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
higher than they expected but over the
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
biennium I'm certain that we will have
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
places for all of it
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
I guess what I was looking for is if you
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
had more of a specific number if you had
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
say 10 000 units that were out there to
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
be supported by you folks or you had 2
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
000. we're wrestling with obviously we
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to give to
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
everybody that's asking so we're just
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
trying to get a firm figure from folks
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
so what they really might need versus
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
what they hope they might be
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
I understand represent Maguire thank you
 
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so you said you started in
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
1988 correct 1981 is when our
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
organization was uh 1991. so we're
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
talking 40 years
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
you've you've invested 62 million over
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
40 years
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
right so that's a run rate of more like
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
a million and a half a year it's not
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
nothing like 25 million over two years
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
but you say you've got way more projects
 
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
than 25 million so how is that possible
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
I mean your normal rate is a little
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
well we we have funding sources beyond
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund so Rob
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned the low income housing tax
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
credit which is a federal program and
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
where this the state's agent for the U.S
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
treasury in that program that's the
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
principal source of developing capital
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing rental affordable
 
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:15.740 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire and Nationwide
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
and we receive also Federal block grants
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
for similar purposes so there there are
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
other funding sources the return rate is
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
not something that we we count on it's
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that just happens on a
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
kind of an ad hoc basis depending upon
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
the condition of any particular
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
development so some years it may be zero
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
in other years it may be double uh 1.4
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
it varies considerably that's that's
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
just an average over the past seven
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
years of returns
 
00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:47.630 align:start position:0%
years of returns
foreign

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
if I may representative I would say also
 
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.210 align:start position:0%
if I may representative I would say also
that

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
we're in a housing crisis now that we
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
weren't in 25 or 35 years ago and so the
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
need for public investment in meeting
 
00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:01.700 align:start position:0%
the needs in terms of housing Supply uh
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
is is uh there's a clearer case for it
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
now I guess than there was a few decades
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
ago man sure so how much money has the
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
federal government put in over those 40
 
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.330 align:start position:0%
federal government put in over those 40
years

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we've tallied that but
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
we could do that and get that number for
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
you okay so it's a big number is that
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
what we're saying yeah much bigger than
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
62 million yes and representative
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
McGuire I I would also point out that in
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
the preceding biennium uh uh the
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund was appropriated
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
25 million
 
00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:39.019 align:start position:0%
we anticipated using that over two years
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
and in fact we used it in the first year
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
of its utilization because the need was
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
so great
 
00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:49.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
additional questions from the division I
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
do have one I guess as a follow-up to
 
00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
how is this the first time I'm sure it's
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
not but I never like to assume this is a
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial ask the 25 million
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
dollars what have you received from the
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
state in the past as far as general fund
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
dollars towards this fund do you know
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
the the number 62 million 62.6 million
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
total Appropriations to the affordable
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
housing fund since it was created in
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
1988. that's all that was all General
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
funds it there there I I have a tally
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
but I did not bring it with me but some
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
of it was bonded and was in House Bill
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
25 in in any budget year there were a
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
couple of off-budget Appropriations
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
um I think one of those was a bond uh
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
you know wrapped into other things the
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
state was bonding for as well at the
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
um do those generally go through uh
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
public works because we've had some
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
discussion within the division a number
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
of these items that we're seeing this
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
year had historically gone to Public
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
Works which has a threshold top of about
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars that they have to
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
work with so I'm guessing all this came
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
here because the fire exceeded their
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
threshold well I'm just curious why this
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
may not have gone to public works first
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
or maybe again
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
I think the the point is that anytime
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's bonded yeah anytime anytime it is
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
proposed to be uh in a bond it goes to
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
public works first
 
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
and then comes here uh whenever it's not
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
included as part of a bond it comes to
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
the finance committee first
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not always true but
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
well it in our in our experience it
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
should but it's not always true in our
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
experience that has been the pattern
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
with these Appropriations to the
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund okay for the
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
affordable but we've seen a lot of
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
things come there go here we had the
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of Public Works here just the
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
other day because there was some
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
crossover that we wanted to try to
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
address so
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent grassy
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
um question I have is you know when we
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
talk about how much money that you're
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
you're getting here and compared to what
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
you've got in previous years you said
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of about 23 000 units
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state of New
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the Latin number of years
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
that you've been in existence how many
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
units annually do you bring online
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
well it's more annually now than it was
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
earlier in our uh earlier in our history
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh right now as I said it's 500 to 1000
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
per year in our 40-year history I think
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
we've uh financed something around 17
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
000 units about 15 000 or still of which
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
are still in our portfolio and still
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
affordable so you you say you bring on
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
annually you've probably averaged about
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
between 500 and a thousand units per
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
year and we've got a 23 000 unit
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
shortage so that's why this money is
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
looking to try to put a dent in that and
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
if I remember one of the comments you
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
made you could probably with this money
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
there's a chance you could do half that
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
those number of units so we could
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
probably be looking at about 11
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
000 units coming on based on the amount
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
of money that you have here that's I
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's a big ask but that certainly
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
would address a substantial uh you know
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
going to its addressing the need that we
 
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.849 align:start position:0%
going to its addressing the need that we
have

00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think we would not be able to create
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
11 000 units with with this funding uh
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
it would be substantially less than that
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh it it you know it contributes toward
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
solving the problem but it is not alone
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
the solution
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up to that
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
um The Realistic figure you're saying
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
about a thousand units is your hope or
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
goal or so what do you have any idea
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
what that would cost as far as
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
well let me tell you why it's difficult
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
I know it's difficult because of the
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
size of the units where the units are
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
and all that but just a guesstimation
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
It's Not Unusual for us to need a
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of public
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy to make an affordable housing a
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
permanently affordable housing uh unit
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh to bring it into existence now I will
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire asked a question
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
earlier about whether invest in age
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
could be combined with this fund These
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
funds and so that's a big variable if 30
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars of invest in each money
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
is available and a substantial portion
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
of these projects are availing
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
themselves at both there may be fifty
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of affordable housing
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
fund going into that project and it
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
might kind of look like we're creating
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
twice as many units but obviously a
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
dollar public subsidy is a dollar public
 
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.630 align:start position:0%
dollar public subsidy is a dollar public
subsidy

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
hey thank you uh
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further questions so
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look at this and take a
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
look at the Senate bill as well and see
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
how they correspond
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 46 which is new to the
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
division we haven't seen this before
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
this is establishing a committee to
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
study replacement of bail Commissioners
 
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.020 align:start position:0%
with court
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
magistrates do we have a copy of that 46
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman we do not the last one has
 
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:42.950 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman we do not the last one has
49.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
so those guys
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
don't seem very good at getting paid
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
back right I mean if I loaned out 60
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars I'm sure you'd get paid
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
back you'd get paid back you wouldn't
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
get paid back a million and a half a
 
00:39:56.099 --> 00:42:10.010 align:start position:0%
get paid back a million and a half a
year

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the work session on House
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 436 I see the prime sponsor is here
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
we'd like to
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
there you go make sure you turn the mic
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
on there you go yes
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Linda Harrier gathwaite I'm a
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative from Nashville New
 
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.109 align:start position:0%
representative from Nashville New
Hampshire

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um Hills 10 Ward 9. and I'm here to
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
and this is my first time before you so
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
I have no clue oh no no not to worry
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're we're fairly nice sometimes uh Mr
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hoffman do you have the docket held
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
this made it through the house and the
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represent we usually
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
try to get a little history first and
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
try to get a little history first and
okay

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
I hate to assume but I would have
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
thought it went to
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
well that's what
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I thought attorney
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
head would be here and I text him and he
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
said it was no physical impact so
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
the bill was referred to criminal
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety and the
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
committee report was ought to pass with
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
amendment by a vote of 20-0 and that
 
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.770 align:start position:0%
amendment by a vote of 20-0 and that
Amendment

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:11.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
which is in front of you now passed on
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney so so Mr Hoffman
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
with the original version of the bill
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
did that have a fiscal impact yes and
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime sponsor
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire um
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
not really I'm sorry not for you I just
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
I think we should simply say off the
 
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
I think we should simply say off the
pass

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
um but I do notice two typos on line ten
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
so maybe we nine ten yeah
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
um this sentence the committee shall
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether bail commissioner
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
should be replaced or supplemented by
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
Court magistrates and assess the
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
following so it should be bail
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners should be replaced
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
right or something
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's all okay thank you yeah so maybe
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
we make a little a little amendment to
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
fix that sentence and just say off the
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
past if that makes sense
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh been moved I Believe by
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire with those two
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
grammatical Corrections is it seconded
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
represent a Sweeney
 
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.530 align:start position:0%
represent a Sweeney
okay

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes discussion
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a this bill is uh
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
something that's been kicking around in
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
the court system for quite some time and
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
I believe I don't know whether I saw it
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the in the court system budget or
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line uh in this
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
session I saw a
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
a bill of provisions and a bill that
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually accomplished what's in this
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
study committee and I think the probably
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
the reason the study committee is being
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
proposed is because they may have run
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
into some problems as far as getting
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
getting it done because there is
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
there is a fair amount of cost involved
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
in accomplishing what this what this
 
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.210 align:start position:0%
in accomplishing what this what this
bill

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
would result in if the if the study
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh examined into the the cost
 
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.490 align:start position:0%
committee uh examined into the the cost
of

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:36.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
creating a magistrates and also the
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
logistics involved in the bail system
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
I would have to completely revamp the
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
bail system because of the present time
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's run well it's run locally not at
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
State funds that work out but bail
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioners work locally and are
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
generally under the supervision of the
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
district court system
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
and the spirit court gets involved to
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
some degree but most of the most of the
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
bail issues are started in the district
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
court system because they start when
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we can put you on this committee
 
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.710 align:start position:0%
maybe we can put you on this committee
representative

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
well there's a line of fiscal impact the
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
so it has been moved and seconded our

00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
all right moving right along Mr Hoffman
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
moving right along uh Mr Hoffman you
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
have a number of documents I know to
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr hoppen are very busy they've
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
got a status documents for us
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
and some other things
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
maybe we can start with the revenue not
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
sure two Hospital one back budget
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:53.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mike or Melissa whatever you want to
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at the back of the
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of this
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
actually most of this
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
reappears every every two years
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
um describes all the footnotes that you
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
see in the budget as you flip through it
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
the letter footnotes
 
00:50:30.839 --> 00:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
the letter footnotes
um

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
used to be assigned to various class
 
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.410 align:start position:0%
used to be assigned to various class
lines

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so for example
 
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
um so for example
um

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
footnote f
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
identifies that that's an appropriation
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't elapse in the first year
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
and is available for the two years of
 
00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.750 align:start position:0%
and is available for the two years of
biennium

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:50:54.849 --> 00:50:54.859 align:start position:0%
G restricts the use of a particular line
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
so that it cannot be
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
transferred or used for anything else so
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
you may see that in things like
 
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
you may see that in things like
utilities

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
and then a B and H used to be used but
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
footnote I you'll see with other sources
 
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:18.380 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that if the revenue doesn't
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
come in agencies don't don't spend
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
section two that's something that
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
um division two will deal with regarding
 
00:51:40.569 --> 00:51:40.579 align:start position:0%
University system accounts and Community
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
has to do with the assignment of Office
 
00:51:50.579 --> 00:51:53.210 align:start position:0%
has to do with the assignment of Office
Space

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
a department of administrative Services
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
manages the office space and
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
if such state-owned space is available
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
they try to make sure that agencies
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
using state-owned space before they go
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission is another
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
then Section 5 all of the positions that
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
are no longer needed and abolished in
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
this case
um

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget or Hospital want
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
to introduce are listed here
 
00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:39.859 align:start position:0%
and those positions go away permanently
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being just unfunded
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
so anything that's authorized that's on
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
the abolished list
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
can never be filled again they would
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
have to seek new positions through
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire followed by
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin so if a position
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
is existing but unfunded sometimes the
 
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or whoever can shift
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
money into that unfunded and then hire
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
somebody is that right certain
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have that Authority like
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and it may be
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
one or two others Corrections
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
allows them flexibility but anytime you
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
see that language it also includes the
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
sentence as long as they don't exceed
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
their Appropriations for salaries and
 
00:53:32.819 --> 00:53:34.370 align:start position:0%
their Appropriations for salaries and

was funded but didn't have a person for
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
a long time they might decide to
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
to move it into some other position
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
right right yeah or if if the
 
00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:50.450 align:start position:0%
right right yeah or if if the
commissioner

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
has vacancies
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
this one's funded but I don't need it
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin are any of these

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
most likely not and if they were the
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
governor would have already accounted
 
00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
section 6 appears every year and
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services Bureau of
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
Child Support gets assert a certain
 
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:32.900 align:start position:0%

to provide that they can
process

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%

child support orders and and services in
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%

and this is
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
as long as I can remember this section
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
then seven shows you the governor's
 
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.630 align:start position:0%
then seven shows you the governor's
recommended

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues for the general
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
fund and the education trust fund
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
then on the back you have the highway
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
and Fish and Game fund
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
the other handout is from house Ways and
 
00:55:08.819 --> 00:55:12.109 align:start position:0%
the other handout is from house Ways and
Means

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
and that is the
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
house unrestricted revenues
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
so similar sections the back of the
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.730 align:start position:0%
so similar sections the back of the
budget

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
for the bill introduced includes
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
Governor's Revenue estimate and the
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
document that you have with
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler as a sponsor is
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so the main difference between
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
these two other than the specific
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
numbers is the new one contains the
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
communication tax right that's still
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
taken out in House Bill 2 so maybe we
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't put it back into how spill one
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
the uh the way Ways and Means presents
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
these is based on current law
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
so whatever happens whether the
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
communications tax stays in or comes out
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the Surplus schedule
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
that Mike Kane prepares you'll have your
 
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
base revenues
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
and then he has scheduled two
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments adjustments to revenue so
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
we'll have another line on the Surplus
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
that shows Revenue adjustments
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
so right now the governor's budget
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
communication tax is out if the house
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
leaves it in Mike Kane will have a
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
surplus adjustment to reflect that
 
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
right but I mean this amendment 0868
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
has the communication tax so if we
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
adopted this amendment all of a sudden
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
one and two House Bill one and House
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
Bill two don't match anymore
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
you were you would be agreeing with Ways
 
00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
and Means up to this point in time yeah
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then the house still has the option
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
of deciding What Becomes of the
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax okay so when
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
if we left it out you would we would
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
have another amendment to this section
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
right that would yeah okay
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
because that's about what 56 million
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of money but yeah
 
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.650 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of money but yeah
yeah

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:23.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah they'd have to go after those that
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
were delinquent and chase people that
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right we'll just take a quick three
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
minute break and start at 10 30 on House
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.760 --> 01:01:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
my ways and means on the revenue figures
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
where the norm major Susan only whoever
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
would come in but we don't have to do
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we can accept what the house took
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
up yesterday and just accept their
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
numbers and use it as our Baseline so
 
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:03.260 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that represent McGuire
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay I mean revenues our thing because
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
so miss representative McGuire will move
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
to we just accept the
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue figures that have been presented
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
to us by Ways and Means correct
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it's seconded by representative
 
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.750 align:start position:0%
and it's seconded by representative
Griffin

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
and seeing no more discussion we'll just
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
have a show a hand so Mike and put it in
 
01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:33.859 align:start position:0%

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
pension cap annually that was done to
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
keep up with inflation
 
01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.829 align:start position:0%
keep up with inflation
um

01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
added cost to the bill it has certainly
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
added stress to the actuaries and trying
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
to determine what all that means
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of making this work
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
better it was struck out in the
 
01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:27.470 align:start position:0%
better it was struck out in the
amendment

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
so the hard 125 000 hard cap will just
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
be the hard cap it won't it won't adjust
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
it won't increase the
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
the legislature someday could address
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
that if they need to if it's a problem
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.090 align:start position:0%
but that
um

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the interest of making things better
 
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.689 align:start position:0%
in the interest of making things better
for

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
for the bill and for the ability for
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
forecasting that that was the precipice
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
all right questions representative
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
for being here to take the question so
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt this amendment what
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
would the new fiscal note roughly
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
estimate say for the bill
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
that's why representative Pearson asked
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
me to join him up here for the record
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin representing nhrs we don't
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
have a position on the bill one way or
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
the other but because of the complicated
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
nature representative Peterson I thought
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to get up together
 
01:09:23.699 --> 01:09:25.309 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to get up together
because

01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
um some questions he may be able to
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
answer and some and I may be uh so so
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
essentially the
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
um increase to the maximum benefit limit
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
and the 1.25 escalator going forward
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
added um cost both to the normal cost
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
and to the unfunded liability piece for
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
um on the normal cost side it was about
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
you know 0.12 percent of pay to 0.22 and
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
on the unfunded side it was about 0.25
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
to 0.5 and these These are rough numbers
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you know from the actual they haven't
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
valued this amendment or change or
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
anything but by way of illustration the
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the covered payroll
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
um for group two police and fire and
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 was about 483 million dollars
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
so if this change were to lower the
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
employer rate impact by one percent of
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
pay okay and that it may be lower than
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
that that's that's sort of a high-end
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
estimate that would cut off the annual
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
employer contributions about 4.8 million
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
dollars so it would it would reduce it
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know in fiscal 26. you know by any
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
again these aren't down to the penny
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
numbers this is this is a rough ballpark
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
if the normal if the
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
if the if the elimination of the
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
escalator or whatever you would call the
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
1.25 is less than that it's going to be
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
less but on an optimistic end it's 4.8
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
maybe at 0.75 off the rate it'd be about
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
3.6 you know but we're talking Millions
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
but for eliminating that
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you Mr chairman in
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
we see fiscal year 25 had a 25 million
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation uh but combined for
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 the expenditure was 165 000
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
for the state and then uh indeterminable
 
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
for the state and then uh indeterminable
for

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions in 24 and 25 but
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
then in 26 with another 25 million
 
01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:27.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the state uh 3.28
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
million from expenditures from the state
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
but then a 13 13 million eight hundred
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
and sixty thousand dollar expenditure
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
from the political subdivision so this
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment would it lower
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
the state expenditures or the political
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
subdivisions expenditure it would lower
 
01:11:45.659 --> 01:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
subdivisions expenditure it would lower
both

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know proportionally
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
so you know the political subdivision
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
projected cost just for the police and
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
Fireside in uh 26 so like 11.5 million
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and the States was 2.88 so you know it
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
would you know it as a on a proportional
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
basis the reduction would be the same in
 
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:09.380 align:start position:0%
both lines
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you thank you again
 
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you for being here take your
 
01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:15.980 align:start position:0%
questions I'll I'll make sort of a
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
pre-request that if we were to adopt
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment could you get us the
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for the next 10 years of the
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill as to what you expect expenditures
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
from the state and the political
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to be over each fiscal year
 
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
because we our fiscal no caps at 26.
 
01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:35.659 align:start position:0%
yeah but if we're going to fiscal year
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
2033 in this bill I'd just like to see
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
all the numbers laid out yeah so so
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
um that that's something the actuary
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
would have to run it's it's still an
 
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
unapproved Amendment I'm not sure if we
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
could pull that off but as a way to
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
think about the cost going forward okay
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's the and I think some of the
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
confusion sometimes it comes up when we
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
talk about some of these nhrs bills and
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
the percents is that there's two percent
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
two percentages we're talking about
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
usually you folks deal with the bottom
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
line number it's a million dollars next
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
year it's 1.1 it's a 10 increase
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
our rates are calculated as a percent of
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
the covered payroll so that's that's one
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
percent right you know so if your
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
payroll is a million dollars and the
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
rates ten percent you're paying a
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
contributions you know but if that
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but the difference between what the
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
rates are and what the rates are been
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
you know that if the rates went from 30
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
to 33 percent
 
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
two different sets of percentages and I
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
think that that sometimes muddies the
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
waters and I don't know if we're clear
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
enough on
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
explaining that properly but with the
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 26 numbers okay with the bill
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
as currently adopted by the house not
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that you know
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
13 or 14 million uh you know for for 26.
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
basically you could roll that forward at
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
2.75 increases for the next 10 years to
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
to project what it it's going to cost
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that's the payroll growth the
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
inflation assumption for
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
um group two salaries maybe maybe you
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
know somebody make little that's too low
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
or too high but that's what the current
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumption is that payroll
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
will grow you know um two point seven
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
five percent a year so that
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
um number in the fiscal note
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
um again you could roll that out at
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
times you know 1.0275 for 10 years to
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
see what the cost would look like
 
01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:37.010 align:start position:0%
see what the cost would look like
um

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Maguire
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
is this section
 
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
um RSA 100a's colon 6-5
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
only for group two or does it imply for
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
everybody uh this I everyone yeah so so
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a maximum benefit limit of
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
120 000 for all groups both groups right
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
now and this would just increase it for
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
both as well
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
okay so to increase it for both yeah
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
um follow-up yeah and it would also do
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
this 2001 to 2011 thing for group one
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
employees as well
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
yes it it it yeah right right now those
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
members anybody who was hired before or
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
7109 and hadn't hadn't been invested but
 
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
um or you know it wasn't were invested
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
by one one of twelve that you know they
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't that you had to have been hired by
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
seven one of o nine right now so the
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
people in hired in them both three four
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
five six there is no maximum benefit cap
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
right now on those members
 
01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:51.290 align:start position:0%
right now on those members
um

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
right yeah so may I follow so what I'm
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
talking about is Part B Part B of the of
 
01:15:59.810 --> 01:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
this section five
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
um currently as I understand it they're
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
limited to 85 percent of their final
 
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.669 align:start position:0%
limited to 85 percent of their final
compensation

01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
right and so this is changing it to 100
 
01:16:13.689 --> 01:16:13.699 align:start position:0%
of their final compensation as a maximum
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
yes whichever is the lesser the 125 or
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
the 100 let's say somebody's final
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
compensation was yeah was a hundred or
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah just to make it an easy number
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
right so then there they would currently
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
have a maximum of 85 000.
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill would let them have a
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
maximum of a hundred yeah yeah but I
 
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.430 align:start position:0%
maximum of a hundred yeah yeah but I
guess

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we assume in group one there's
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
hardly any effect because the divisor is
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
66 so you'd have to work 66 years in
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
order to hit the cap right so therefore
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's not much of a difference is
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of the idea yeah yes
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
um you know on a quick back of the
 
01:16:58.620 --> 01:16:59.870 align:start position:0%
um you know on a quick back of the
envelope

01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
um that I did up in my head right now
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
for instance somebody who joined group
 
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.390 align:start position:0%
for instance somebody who joined group
two

01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you know prior to seven one of 11 and
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know but less than four years before
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
then their multiplier is 2.1 percent so
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
they would have to work 40 years to get
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
to 84 of their AFC so then you know so
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
so you know and it's the closer you get
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know if the 2.4 people they have to
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
work less but there's a certain amount
 
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
of years to which you get the max even
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
even under you know the old plan right
 
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.630 align:start position:0%
even under you know the old plan right
now

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
um once uh group two member is working
 
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
more than 40 years and that that's rare
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
but not not
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
um it does happen
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know they they basically have
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
maxed out what their pension is going to
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
be they don't they no longer contribute
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
anymore the the employer still kicks in
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh while they're working but you know so
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
once somebody right now under this law
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
once they would have gotten to 85 30
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
years from now you know um you know they
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
would max out but this this does bring
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
it to a hundred so
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know there's two things at play
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
here you know you don't see those
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
numbers a lot right now but with
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
inflation 10 20 years down the road
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
um you know 125 you know maybe more of a
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
normal number than it you know it seems
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
crazy now but you know what did we all
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
start working at you know 20 30 years
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
ago for our annual salary compared to
 
01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.490 align:start position:0%
ago for our annual salary compared to
now

01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for and that's that's the
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
financial part about the policy part of
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.610 align:start position:0%
financial part about the policy part of
that

01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
wear that 85 to 100 came from was the
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
idea of Representative Carol McGuire
 
01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.810 align:start position:0%
idea of Representative Carol McGuire
so

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you that was that was
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
it her idea that partially that was done
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
to deal with just inflation
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
right so that was the precipice of that
 
01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.810 align:start position:0%
right so that was the precipice of that
thing

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
although I've seen the two of them
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
disagree on stuff so
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely sure yeah my father and
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have a identical voting record
 
01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.870 align:start position:0%
I don't have a identical voting record
either

01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess a concern I have now we
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at this amendment as far
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
as its Financial impact but
 
01:19:06.179 --> 01:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
as its Financial impact but
I

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
sent out the bill to my community of
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
Peterborough just to see what type of
 
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
Peterborough just to see what type of
impact

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
the original bill would have and it was
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
about forty one thousand dollars a year
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
on a very small town with a very small
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
Police and Fire Department
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I would like to see
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
is representative Sweeney also requested
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
if we could have a breakdown of the
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
municipal impacts
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
before we really at least in my opinion
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
move this forward because it's a
 
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
substantial impact whether it's a
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
reduction as far as at 25 million a year
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
for the capital of Chase
 
01:19:57.719 --> 01:20:02.450 align:start position:0%
for the capital of Chase
so

01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
that would be done in conjunction with
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
the rate drop that's occurring as well
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at a potential impact
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
so there'd be no impact this this
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
amendment as far as the financial
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
numbers we've seen yes I mean there's an
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
impact with the amendment to lower it
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely but as far as the impact is
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the community this this this rate in
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
the rate reduction or coinciding
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and the ask is less than
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
the reduction now
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
so the the overall impact from a
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
year-to-year budget of you of the
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
Peterborough fire department would be
 
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.169 align:start position:0%
Peterborough fire department would be
nothing

01:20:47.169 --> 01:20:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler why would it be
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
why would it be lowered
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
why would this go down with the removal
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the why why would the the
 
01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
contribution from the municipalities be
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
lower because the rate is dropping
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
eight percent in Fire and seven percent
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in PD
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we would drop the
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
rate one with 5.7 billion in the hole
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
um what what represent representative
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
Pearson is referring to is the current
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates uh for
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 25 have already been set
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
they're um they're taking effect this
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
July 1st and from compared to the 22 23
 
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
rates the fire rate for instance went
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
down from for the employer side from
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
32.99 of covered payroll to 30.35 so
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's a you know 2.64 reduction in the
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
rate the reason the rates went down um
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
to representative Wilder's point is you
 
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.149 align:start position:0%
to representative Wilder's point is you
know

01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you know the way the rates are
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
calculated it's based on a five-year
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
rolling average of the investment
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
performance in the five-year period
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th of 21 which was the
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
rate setting valuation you know we had a
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
very good five years especially with 21.
 
01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:08.420 align:start position:0%
so so that
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
accelerated the payoff of the liability
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it was able to lower
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
the rates you know by that you know uh
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
by those amounts
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you know ideally if all assumptions
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
are met going forward which is probably
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
an impossibility you know the rates
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
would stay at that level through 2039 in
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the ual is amortized if we
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a bad five-year stretch of
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
Investments and we're below our assumed
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
rate of return or if the board
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
um it chooses to lower the assumed rate
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
of return because of economic
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
projections going forward that's going
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
to put upward pressure on the rate so
 
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:48.260 align:start position:0%
you know to representative you know
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson's point in in a vacuum you know
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 24 25 you know Peterborough is paying
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
you know 2.64 less for fire as a percent
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
of pay is than it is now and this is
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
would increase it without this amendment
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
by 2.62 so
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
but that's in 26 so you know there's you
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
know what I mean it's there are there
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
are unknowns you know in that equation
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
but that you know we did we did see a
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
rate decrease this year which is good
 
01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.090 align:start position:0%
rate decrease this year which is good
news

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:19.100 align:start position:0%
news
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
are you taking that deficit into account
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
at all when you do this rate setting it
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that you are the the the
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
the overall unfunded deficit
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
um yeah they are so it's you know you're
 
01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
always you know the of the 5.7 unfunded
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
right now five million five billion of
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
that was accrued before
 
01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:44.990 align:start position:0%
that was accrued before
um

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 17 which is when the layered
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
amortization came in so that 5 billion
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
is scheduled to be paid down as a
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
percentage of payroll in all four member
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
groups through this through through
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 39. so we've got you know 16 more
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
years to pay that off and the rates
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
are the unfunded portion of the rates
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
you know are developed backwards from
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
that how much are we going to need in
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
2039 and what percent of pay every year
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that that factors in payroll growth
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
over time as well I mean we don't expect
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
the payroll to be the same now there's
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
next year or five or ten years from now
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's going to grow but if the
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
percentage is the same we'll be taking
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
in more dollars you know over the over
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
the subsequent years my recollection is
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a good five years you
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
had one good year out of five
 
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
uh it well we had we had an
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
unprecedentedly Good Year like most
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
individual investors looking at a June
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
30th year over year in in many pension
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
plans they're made 29 over 29 which
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um May well be the highest return we had
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
this some years in the 70s and 80s we
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
can't find data for
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know you know but you know so
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
there was but we don't we don't
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that all at once oh yeah yeah
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
um you know we were in the you know we
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
were in the positive side all five years
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that that and of that 29 in fiscal
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
21. one one-fifth of that was recognized
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the smoothing you know in the other
 
01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
four-fifths of it are going to be
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
recognized fiscal 22 through 26. so in a
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
sense that was a really good year and it
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
helped with the five-year performance
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
but it also puts a little money in the
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
kitty going forward you know to try to
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
insulate against you know a year like
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
um you know the the negative return
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
um if we're looking get another one of
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
that you know when you start stringing
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
together multiple down markets that's
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's when it gets stuff to to hit your
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
average over five
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
going back 10. that's not how it
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney Mr chairman I
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
have a procedural question
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
um for the more experienced members of
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
the committee can we request a fiscal
 
01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
note for this amendment without adopting
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
it or do we have to adopt it in order to
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
get a fiscal note no we can get a
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
physical note if we really want one but
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
it always makes it cleaner for the LBA
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know represent I mean with typically
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
we write fiscal notes on amendments that
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
have been adopted by the whole body
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
just because there's so many amendments
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
out there with retirement amendments
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's even more restrictive because the
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
general fund pays for their Actuarial
 
01:26:25.139 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
general fund pays for their Actuarial
work

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
so yeah a couple of years ago they they
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
came in there was a bill filed by
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
someone actually and I think on this
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
division to require the general fund I
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
believe it was Kathy McGuire McGuire
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
Kathy Rogers yeah yeah because she felt
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
we were taking too much from the
 
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:46.340 align:start position:0%
retirement system to find these
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
actuarials fiscal notes so
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
but I think before we move forward we
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
really need a fiscal note right there's
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of money here
 
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.450 align:start position:0%
a lot of money here
um

01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of changes I've been
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
trying to go through the amendment very
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
quickly to see the changes and I
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm still having some problems getting
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
my head around
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
the change yeah go ahead let me ask
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
Marty along these lines do you does the
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
actuary analyze the bills section by
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
section and therefore say the effect of
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
section one is X dollars an effective
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
section two is like that so if we're
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
thinking about an amendments can we in
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
our mind say okay if I change section
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
two maybe it does this right not it
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't tend to work that way unless
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's it there's you know they're very
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
two separate bifurcated changes because
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of these most of these changes in
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
almost all cases they interact with each
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
other you know the retirement age or the
 
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:49.139 align:start position:0%
multiplier so if you change one it's
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
Gonna Change other aspects of it so they
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
they doing it as a la carte I I don't
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
think is is possible you know unless
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
there was a particular piece of
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
legislation that does something over
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
here and something over there you know
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know but these are all interrelated
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
so to analyze this amendment you can't
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
just sort of look at section five of the
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill you have to yeah that that was the
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know the the the sort of quote you
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
know optimistic ballpark answer to
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney you know but they
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
would have to actually you know run the
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
run the model again with these changes
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
and then see what it actually comes out
 
01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
and then see what it actually comes out
so

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
so the only change that I see in
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's a one-page Amendment but comparing
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
it to section five in the original bill
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
as amended by the house it's just that
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
language and C the maximum benefit shell
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
increase annually by the 1.25 not that's
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
the only change BNC B it occurs in B and
 
01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:58.689 align:start position:0%
the only change BNC B it occurs in B and
C

01:28:58.689 --> 01:28:58.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
85 crossed out to 100 on my b yeah
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
that's correct that there's no change
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
there the change is the reduction of the
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
one in a quarter percent annual and that
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
occurs in two paragraphs yeah yeah I see
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
it yeah right
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
but that's the only that is up above as
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
far as the dates and they're all they
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
all remain the same correct that's
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
what's in the original bill that was
 
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.189 align:start position:0%
what's in the original bill that was
passed

01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
so how soon can we get a revised fiscal
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
note or how soon can you look at this
 
01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:31.689 align:start position:0%
note or how soon can you look at this
Marty

01:29:31.689 --> 01:29:31.699 align:start position:0%
Marty
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we could put a call out today and
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
then I can get an estimate you know from
 
01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
them on on um you know when we I can get
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
something I'm thinking that you know
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
sometime next week is typically when
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
there's a rush
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know Amendment you know we you know
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
just under the normal course under RSA
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
1444 you know they're asking LBA assets
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
to flip it in five days so that's always
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
our goal
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
so just a follow-up to that question we
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
know the original Bill had a 25 million
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
dollar general fund impact for both the
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
first and second year the biennium and
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
then carrying through to 2033 I think
 
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.950 align:start position:0%
then carrying through to 2033 I think
yeah

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
what was the total Municipal impact
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
to someone the original Bill the dollar
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
amount well well um oh the overall
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
dollar amount was 200 203 million for
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
the municipal impact well no that was
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
just the cost of the whole bill I'm just
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
curious about the municipal impact is uh
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn to
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
the gentle lady from the municipal
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
Association Mrs hack do you
 
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:43.550 align:start position:0%
Association Mrs hack do you
have

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
could you could you please use the mic
 
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.610 align:start position:0%
could you could you please use the mic
thanks

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
I believe the original Bill didn't have
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note um immediately attached
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
when the bill was introduced and then
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
the amendment was so quickly introduced
 
01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.550 align:start position:0%
the amendment was so quickly introduced
thereafter

01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
um we've been we have been working based
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
on the amended language
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
so do you have like a dollar figure that
 
01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
you folks have come up with as far as a
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
municipal impact of this legislation
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
so to quickly answer that we look at
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
each bill and each policy proposal and
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
its impact to the municipality and then
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
we look at the aggregate amount based on
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
how many bills are passing through the
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and right now we
 
01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
have six bills all with a municipal
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
impact all having a cumulative impact on
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
Municipal rates so in a vacuum each bill
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
decided upon itself will have one effect
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
but when you each bill that we pass
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
forward that has another effect will
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
continue to compound that so well the
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
assumptions that representative Pearson
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
and Mr Carlin stated are absolutely the
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
same as our position it all stays the
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
same and the actuary analysis the
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
Investments continue at and the rates of
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
return are the same this would be the
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
impact but if changes continue to be
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
made to the statute in this area or
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
other areas there will be accumulative
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
or aggregate impact that is what we
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
consider for our members so
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit complicated and I can
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
send you all of that analysis if you'd
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
like I just I just I was just looking I
 
01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219 align:start position:0%
always try to find something simple but
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
it's simple unfortunately but I was just
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
really curious if you had put something
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
together just the impact of this
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
specific bill as it was drafted as far
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
as the impact on municipalities that's
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
all so I know you're saying there's all
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
these other things but just this
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
specific one so when we did a very brief
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
kind of survey of a few members just who
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
quickly will respond we had similar
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
results to you there was a high impact
 
01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
but that didn't take into account for
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
everything being equal in a in a vacuum
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
that would be if it was an escalator and
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
of course what we don't know is salary
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
increases moving forward in 2026 we
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
can't predict that because that affects
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
the retirement rates and our members
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
were counting on the plan through 2039
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
to fund the you all so that they can see
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
their rates go down so every time we add
 
01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:13.490 align:start position:0%
their rates go down so every time we add
something

01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
um they can't count count on their rates
 
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
going down and in future budgeting and
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated communities like
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
Peterborough being one of them it's a
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger of a town they do that
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
kind of analysis in future years on to
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
what the savings might be in their
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
future budgets so
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's a complex issue and it's a
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
complex policy decision and I'm sorry I
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't have that data on my fingertips
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
sir all right no problem thanks
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
so the other question I have for I guess
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Marty in the letter you sent out
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
to me which I've shared with all the
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
division members you did make a
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
there was an indication in here that
 
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
this would obviously have an impact on
 
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
again I know we have another amendment
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
so that just changes everything up for
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
us but
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
well the current bill not putting this
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
amendment aside the group two portion of
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
that there was it
 
01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.090 align:start position:0%
that there was it
um

01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
it was I think it was 13.8 million
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded across all the groups six
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
million of that is attributable to to
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
group two
 
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the group one population is much
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
larger so they pick up a bigger piece of
 
01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
larger so they pick up a bigger piece of
that

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
um you know and and you know and of that
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
six million the actor again this wasn't
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
a report this was a you know a
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
conference call you know that you know
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
would would estimate you know you know
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
ballpark that the
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
benefit escalator would add about 0.25
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
or point between 0.25 and 0.5 to the
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
percent of payroll
 
01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.070 align:start position:0%
percent of payroll
um

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
so so it you know that it's it's a
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's a real number and it's going to add
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
up you know when we're talking costs in
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
the in the millions
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
um you know but that that's what if
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
doing a fiscal note on the amendment
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
show the difference you know between the
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
original and this and that I I
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
um to the question you had for Miss hack
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I do have information available
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
on the covered payroll for State versus
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal group two members so
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
um you know I could send that
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
you know how much the municipalities can
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know um payroll for for uh police
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
and fire is and you know the difference
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
in this bill with or without the 250
 
01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.870 align:start position:0%
in this bill with or without the 250
million

01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
um again the original Bill not with the
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
amendment um it the actuary projected an
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
increase in um the rate of 2.62 to 2.72
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
percent for the two groups with the 25
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
million a year for 10 years and and
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
without the 25 without any additional
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
State appropriation you just passed it
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
and everybody paid their shares those
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
rates would have been
 
01:36:08.639 --> 01:36:09.850 align:start position:0%
rates would have been
um

01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:09.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
oh you know what I'm talking about
 
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.709 align:start position:0%
oh you know what I'm talking about
um

01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
5.96 for police and 6.01 for fire so so
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
the percent as a percentage of payroll
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the employer rates for you know for a
 
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
state and local would be more than
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
double so if you're projecting Municipal
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
costs without any state funding you know
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
the the state's um you know picking up
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
as you know offsetting a significant
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
portion of the cost that would have been
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh put onto the municipalities you know
 
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
through a rate increase over the next
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know 20 or so years
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah as you I think everybody knows
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're wrestling with uh less money than
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the governor told us we had and we have
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
just in this division hundreds of
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars collectively that
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
are impacted by less Revenue so
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get a better number
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
because there has been some limited
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
having the municipalities pay this
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
portion because the state may not have
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
the 25 million dollars a year and that's
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
why we'd like to see what the municipal
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
impact because I know no it would be
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
substantial yeah I I probably in-house
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
give you an aggregate number for the
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities and maybe run the payroll
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
of you know 15 or 20 towns of various
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
sizes to show
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the impacts you know
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
because basically once you have once
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
somebody can pull that data out of the
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
system for me all you do is multiply it
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
by the percentage rates here to show
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
what the extra cost would be you know
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
that does doesn't require an actuary
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
further questions from the division
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire yeah and thank you Mr
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
chairman so who produced this piece of
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
paper that was done by nhrs staff that
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
that just it's a sample
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
um if if you find it helpful very
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we could we could roll it
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
out for all the different tiers in in
 
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
trb as well as the seven one of 11 hires
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
in in TRC but basically what it did was
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
it just took the average police and fire
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
salary you know you know over the last
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
five years and use that as a high five
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
or a high three for a theoretical
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
um group two police member retiring with
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
22 years of service and shows some of
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
the differences in the benefit
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
calculation how the AFC is changed by
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
using a five versus a three average how
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the application of unused sick and
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
vacation time weather accounts or not
 
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
impacts the benefit and how the
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
multiplier impacts the benefit
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and you know they
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
it there's also a compensation over base
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
trigger in the um the trb folks that
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
could lower that AFC even a little bit
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
more depending on their
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
um salary history over the last 10 years
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
and how that was earned and reported so
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
so that you know that's another variable
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
that that's it's an extremely
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that's like pin and Jello to the
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
wall because it depends on the
 
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.470 align:start position:0%
wall because it depends on the
individual

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
um almost to
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
estimate that so
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
um thanks can I I'd like to ask some so
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
I think these kind of examples are very
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
Illuminating so more of them in would be
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
better right so okay so let me ask about
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
the lower left corner here the average
 
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.370 align:start position:0%
the lower left corner here the average
salaries

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
do you so something weird happened in
 
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:43.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 compared to 21 which is
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
police jumped by uh four thousand and or
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
3800 and fire declined by
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
2400 or something do you have any
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
explanation of why that happened we have
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
a theory
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and folks behind me can tell me if
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
they think it's right or wrong but in in
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 which was you know July 1 of
 
01:40:09.890 --> 01:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
20 through June 30th
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
um a lot of First Responders primarily
 
01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the fire service were doing coveted
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and other things across the
 
01:40:17.219 --> 01:40:18.169 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and other things across the
state

01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:20.300 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know receiving
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
compensation for that so I think we were
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that's kind of where that that
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
came in as they were working more hours
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
and maybe more money that year mainly
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and isn't the other Factor too is in
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the substantial Staffing shortages
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
on the police side that increase is
 
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
because overtime is beyond through the
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
roof I mean the Department of
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections has expelled their annual
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
overtime by the they did it by the end
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
of January so you're gonna you will see
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
higher numbers in police because they're
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
being forced to work more
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
I see do you have figures for average
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
number of hours worked in these
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
categories or not really we don't we all
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
the employers report to us is you know
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
total compensation you know you know
 
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
ProPay period we add it up but you know
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
we don't get in on an hour later so a
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
dollar of standard salary and a dollar
 
01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:15.020 align:start position:0%
of overtime are the same yeah yeah
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
we charge the same percentage on both
 
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:21.620 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
any uh follow-up questions
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin anything else or
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
um or is it grassy anything no I I was
 
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
hoping to get a lot of answers today but
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
I think we could uh I think we can work
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
what I think we've accumulated a lot
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Sweeney it's just
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
to be clear so do we need to vote to
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment in order to get the
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
like that's technically not but we can
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
see this will make everybody happy
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
well I I would I would make the motion
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt 0891h
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
motion has been made a second I'll
 
01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.169 align:start position:0%
motion has been made a second I'll
second

01:42:08.169 --> 01:42:08.179 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
adopt and making a very clear statement
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we want the additional financial
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
information on what this amendment does
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
when the clerk is ready if he will
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
please call the roll
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
unless there are other questions
 
01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.709 align:start position:0%
unless there are other questions
no

01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
well I was just going to say the
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
amendment clearly reduces the fiscal
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
impact of the bill so therefore there's
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
no reason not for adopted right so yeah
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
right representative McGuire yes
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney votes yes
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes representative
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
so Marty will be waiting for your
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
analysis and anything else you can
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're under a real tight guideline or
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
deadline look here as you know we've got
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
to make some decisions very quickly
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
because we have to present our
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full Committee in
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
another week so
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
you don't have to get this done
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
yeah do we have like a calendar or
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
something those two yeah we'll be
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
getting that today as well we're getting
 
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask this question I
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
probably don't want to hear the answer
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
when we ask them for a fiscal note on a
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
retirement bill is that a thousand
 
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
dollar thing is it a ten thousand dollar
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
thing what is it the way this statute is
 
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
written is the retirement system
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
collects the costs and charges back to
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
the state and the governor can issue a
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
warrant out of the general fund
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess it depends on the bill and
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
how much work they have to do what we'll
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
do is because it hasn't passed the full
 
01:44:10.619 --> 01:44:11.689 align:start position:0%
do is because it hasn't passed the full
body

01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
we'll put something together with
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
Marty's information and we call it a
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis it doesn't attach to the
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill but if nothing changes after the
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill passes the house
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
same information will go into a fiscal
 
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.450 align:start position:0%
same information will go into a fiscal
level

01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:28.460 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
so whatever is your pleasure if you'd
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
like to use whatever document
 
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
they have we can we can do amendments
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
saying that we've looked at it and don't
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
disagree but you could also just accept
 
01:44:42.970 --> 01:44:42.980 align:start position:0%
what the retirement system
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
presents Marty do you have a better
 
01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.450 align:start position:0%
presents Marty do you have a better
answer

01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
um I it was the question about the cost
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
the cost of a fiscal note you know on a
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
sort of normal bill
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
um typically the cost runs between about
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred and seven thousand
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
depending on the complexity this is a
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
change to an existing analysis so I
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's gonna
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
go way high I'm not I can't tell you how
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
much it's going to be but it's I think
 
01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:13.100 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
well that's that's the average that's a
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
normal bill you know if something more
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
complicated you know would cost more
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
money um Senate Bill three to 11 years
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
ago cost a heck of a lot more than that
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh with its iterations but
 
01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
um that's the range we're looking at so
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I both just spent twenty five hundred
 
01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.729 align:start position:0%
so I both just spent twenty five hundred
dollars

01:45:33.729 --> 01:45:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
500 a piece you know I believe every
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
roll call on the floor of the house is
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
five grand and we don't seem to ever
 
01:45:44.810 --> 01:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole idea behind
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers at the time was we
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
kept asking for reviews and it was going
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
against the unfunded liability so
 
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
Marty and as soon as you obviously get
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
that to Melissa and Mr Hoffman and
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
and for those of you looking it's on
 
01:50:25.209 --> 01:50:25.219 align:start position:0%
page 801 in the budget book
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative grassy we've got to get
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
you you could use represent a wireless
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
book because the page is not correct in
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
the documents you have there that's
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
oh well no it's I think that's
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
represented Wireless but
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
where's Mill's books it's in a locker in
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
all right if you could just introduce
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
yourself for us please good morning I'm
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
Susie anzalone Director of Finance for
 
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
the peas Development Authority
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh this is my first time in front
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
of this committee so I guess I will just
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
kind of give you a brief overview of the
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
budget itself and any questions so uh
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
the most important thing about
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the budget for the for the division
 
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:43.820 align:start position:0%
of ports and harbors is that we are
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
self-funded or pay as you go so
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
um the expenses in here have no impact
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
on the general fund or any other fund
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
there are some wages paid at the state
 
01:51:57.649 --> 01:51:57.659 align:start position:0%
level and some benefits and then the PDA
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
reimburses monthly
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the the big picture of it
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
um pretty straightforward like I said
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
we've got uh we've got five full-time
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
positions here and just some benefits so
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know not a lot of intricate stuff
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
in our budget other than salaries wages
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
and a few benefits
 
01:52:18.239 --> 01:52:19.850 align:start position:0%
and a few benefits
questions

01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah sure thank you
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
um did you have some open positions in
 
01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:26.330 align:start position:0%
um did you have some open positions in
2022

01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
yes we did yes the uh Deputy Harbor
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
Master position was open for quite a
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
while and that's why some of those
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
expenses are smaller for that year yep
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
our our Harper Pilots part of your are
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
the employees our contractors or
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that run the tugboats
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
yeah they're contractors they're not
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
employees of the state except for we
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
have some Harbor Masters but they're not
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
the ones that run the tow boats am I
 
01:52:52.739 --> 01:53:09.229 align:start position:0%
the ones that run the tow boats am I
right

01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.209 --> 01:53:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Wood Anderson
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm the operations manager for the port
 
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.149 align:start position:0%
I'm the operations manager for the port
authority

01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
um so Moran Towing is the tugboat
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
company that that is uh currently
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
contracted in the piscataqua river
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
um and then uh the Portsmouth Pilots
 
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
um are a separate entity but they fall
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
under the director of the poor its genos
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that works
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
okay so but they're both contractors
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
they're not among these five correct
 
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
right correct okay I see and
 
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.070 align:start position:0%
right correct okay I see and
so

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
how does someone well let me put it this
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
way I was once on the fiscal committee
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
and the pilots came to us and wanted an
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
increase in the rates are the rates that
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
we charge
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
um commercial ships to be piloted into
 
01:54:02.699 --> 01:54:03.950 align:start position:0%
um commercial ships to be piloted into
Portsmouth

01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes those were actually ju yes those
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
were actually just amended I believe
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
in the last couple months I want to say
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
the last couple months last two or three
 
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
months those are just actually amended
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
those actually just went up
 
01:54:21.239 --> 01:54:22.550 align:start position:0%
those actually just went up
yeah

01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.169 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:24.179 --> 01:54:25.070 align:start position:0%
okay

I was hoping to see him he's always very
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
colorful he has some good stories about
 
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.270 align:start position:0%
colorful he has some good stories about

01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is one of the easier budgets you'll

see yes that's why I was put on Friday
 
01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:27.910 align:start position:0%

all right well seeing no further
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions again thank you and
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
you won't obviously need to come back
 
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.870 align:start position:0%
you won't obviously need to come back
yeah

01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so as a divisional
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
set of checking this off yeah
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:54.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.209 --> 01:55:58.219 align:start position:0%
that's still 47.
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
so Mr Anderson could I ask you a
 
01:56:03.530 --> 01:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
question outside absolutely yeah just
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.639 --> 01:56:11.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's represent
 
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:14.689 align:start position:0%
yes that's represent
um

01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:21.129 --> 01:56:21.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
so we have section 45 which we have
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
discussed already the invest New
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 303 30 round that's 30 million
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
and then the affordable housing fund of
 
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.790 align:start position:0%
and then the affordable housing fund of
25

01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
million section 47
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
the divisions
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
pleasure I I'm very uncomfortable with
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
two separate programs for one thing you
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
know uh duplicate it seems like
 
01:57:04.129 --> 01:57:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know I did hear from a former
 
01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
chairman umberger the other day and she
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
heard some of our discussion about the
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
matter she's probably watching right now
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh and she encouraged me to say that
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
some money
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know a specific amount but she
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
was very supportive of invest New
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for what they've done even in
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
her community as far as affordable
 
01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.169 align:start position:0%
her community as far as affordable
housing

01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
as I said to her the other day all these
 
01:57:35.930 --> 01:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
funds had been supported federally in
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
the past and these are all this is a
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
general fund asked for both
 
01:57:43.609 --> 01:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
so it's 55 million dollars as a general
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
fund yeah so it's a lot of money
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
collectively and
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
I was go ahead represent so is invest
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
investment is not a loan right it's a
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's a grant yeah whereas the other one
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
is sort of alone but they they don't
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
collect very well is that I believe
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
eventually okay I believe you're good
 
01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
eventually okay I believe you're good
but

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
um

01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:13.820 align:start position:0%
are very little
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated interest yeah so yeah
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's basically it's a partnership
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
whereas the best I think you can get a
 
01:58:22.199 --> 01:58:23.589 align:start position:0%
whereas the best I think you can get a
granted

01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh everybody use their my experience
 
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.850 align:start position:0%
oh everybody use their my experience
shadow

01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and she will sign them up
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
no because what they what the Senate
 
01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:42.659 align:start position:0%
would do with this bill if they decide
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
to pass it is they would table it and
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
put it in their version of the budget
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
and then when we got to Committee of
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
conference we would work out the
 
01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
differences okay so it's you can't have
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
bills that spend money in a budget year
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
and you know they have to be in the
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
and we would do the same thing if we had
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
such a bill
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
so what we've what we've done in the
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
past and those of you that have been on
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
division one or other divisions
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that the Senate has better
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue numbers and we do sometimes
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
we'll take something out knowing that
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
now they have Senate Bill 231 I believe
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
um we could take these out entirely
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
or leave sometimes a dollar is just put
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
in as a placeholder but there's a lot of
 
01:59:30.179 --> 01:59:32.570 align:start position:0%
in as a placeholder but there's a lot of
options

01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
represent Sweeney so I have just a
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
comment on invest NH and it's uh line 32
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
grants and Loans may be made by the
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
department to municipalities and two
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
housing developers I can understand
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
grants being made to municipalities and
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
I can understand loans being made to
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
developers but I'm confused about the
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
policy of Grants and Loans available to
 
01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.310 align:start position:0%
policy of Grants and Loans available to
both

01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and to the developers
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
almost like a separation of
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
if we're giving a grant to a
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
municipality for off-site or on-site
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
improvements for water or Road impacts
 
02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
for development I get that and I
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
understand the financing and Loans to
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
the developers to allow them to build
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
the housing that they want uh I don't
 
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
think the state should be in the
 
02:00:22.729 --> 02:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
business of giving grants to Developers
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
for construction or
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
I could see loans to municipalities for
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
their for any impacts of the projects
 
02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
but I I without more I I just have a
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
question of how those grants to
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
developers would be used it invests in
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
age when we also have the affordable
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
housing financing for the developers to
 
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
access as well
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it was interesting to hear that
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
they can tap both resources and then
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
afford the affordable housing fund comes
 
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
in at the end and reassesses based on
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
what their needs are if they're getting
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
the other funds from invest in h and to
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
stretch the dollar it just seems that
 
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
if we maybe identify them more in their
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
Lanes like invest in H's to Grants to
 
02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:05.870 align:start position:0%
Lanes like invest in H's to Grants to
municipalities

02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the impact of housing projects and
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
that affordable housing fund is to the
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
developers to loan the financing that
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
might make it clearer and not have so
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
much overlap I think what you're looking
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
at I think what you're looking at here
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
though is some of those grants that are
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
going out are not just going to
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities but they're going to
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
non-profits like housing Partnerships
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
and housing authorities which
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
technically are not the government so
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the questions you take a
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
look at there that the non-profits deal
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
in both grants and Loans so that maybe
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm making an assumption here but I
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
think it may be what what they're
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
talking about and I think I think if we
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
have those NG the non-government
 
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
organizations that aren't the housing
 
02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:48.890 align:start position:0%
organizations that aren't the housing
Developers

02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
Developers
 
02:01:50.689 --> 02:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
we incorporate that into the language
 
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
here in hb2 it just says housing
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
developers yeah and that's that's
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
everyone probably well you know
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what it is it may be it
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a grant but I I
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't disagree with you yeah
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
and it's something we may want to
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
clarify sure I just think if they come
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
and they say oh we already have those
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines in place in the card rails so
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're not granting to a billion dollar
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
housing developer right to build you
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
know 50 units but so yeah no I I agree
 
02:02:19.139 --> 02:02:20.950 align:start position:0%
know 50 units but so yeah no I I agree
yeah

02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah to to me
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is a program started by the federal
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
government and now
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
being shifted onto us you know what I
 
02:02:35.770 --> 02:02:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
it just seems like if we keep these
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
things going we're going to we're going
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
to be asked for this kind of money again
 
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
and again and again
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
um I think we will be anyway well we
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
would believe anyway sure well I thought
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
it was interesting I think it was a
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
response to your question digging into
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
the document representative McGuire that
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
since they were established in 1988
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
they've been allocated 62 million
 
02:03:03.719 --> 02:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
they've been allocated 62 million
dollars

02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
and at the most they said they could do
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
about a thousand units per year right
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
now they have five hundred thousand
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
dollars in their fund
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it did seem like a
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of money the 25 million at least
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
in that line I thought I'd dig down into
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
it but I thought I heard them say the
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
previous budget had 25 million also is
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
that right of General funds yes
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is just the same as last
 
02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is just the same as last
budget

02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
oh I miss that so of the 62 million
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
30 37 was the past 40 years and then 25
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
was last time you know something like
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
that right so it's
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
this I guess was always Federal right
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
and not state or for the most part for a
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm not familiar with what they
 
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
receive for federal funds because we
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
only see the general fund piece but
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
there is also in the real estate
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
transfer tax an allocation of 5 million
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
a year that goes to the affordable
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
so that comes off the top of the real
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
because certainly if the Senate could
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
bring it back and they'll have better
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
revenues which might be better it might
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
so the pleasure represent I mean I don't
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
mind I don't mind moving that we
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate these two sections I mean
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
I I just don't care for this kind of
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
all right so are you moving that yeah
 
02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:05.219 align:start position:0%
so is it seconded no I'll send it in for
 
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
all right which section do you like
 
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
all right which section do you like
better

02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's the appropriation of 25 million
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund right okay
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
so why is that one because it's a loan
 
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.129 --> 02:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
well I thought the Senate Bill had both
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
it has both plus 15 million for
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
something else I thought well let's look
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
at it
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
not that it really shouldn't matter
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it does that's accurate okay
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
it has
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the fiscal notes at
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars to the Department
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services for shelter
 
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
programs two million
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
or housing stabilization 25 million for
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
the which we're discussing now Housing
 
02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority and 30 million for the
 
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
affordable Workforce housing yeah so it
 
02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
you're happy
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's a house anybody else any
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
I see a lot of conversation over there
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
any thoughts
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a section
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
um with that historic housing
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
preservation credit that's in House Bill
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
2 who's also in this Senate bill
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
oh that's an incentive Bill too
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
the uh in best New Hampshire
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
refers to RSA 6 7458 which is Workforce
 
02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.250 align:start position:0%
refers to RSA 6 7458 which is Workforce
housing

02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
it limits the grants to uh affordable
 
02:07:15.239 --> 02:07:17.570 align:start position:0%
it limits the grants to uh affordable
how

02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.179 align:start position:0%
for sale housing which is tenants for
 
02:07:21.179 --> 02:07:22.550 align:start position:0%
for sale housing which is tenants for
sale

02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
sale
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
which is Affordable to a household
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
income of no more than 100 percent of
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the median income for a poor person
 
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
household for the metropolitan area
 
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
02:07:40.609 --> 02:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
limits income up to 60 percent of the
 
02:07:45.530 --> 02:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
so there's limit on the type of projects
 
02:07:51.890 --> 02:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's already an existing statute
 
02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman you showed me a document this
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
morning earlier about how we stood as
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
far as a division on our
 
02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
or house bill one yeah a million dollars
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
under where the governor was for the
 
02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.070 align:start position:0%
under where the governor was for the
biennium

02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
most of that would be attributable to
 
02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch reductions that was
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
almost 2 million
 
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
then there was some general fund
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
ads with the Department of Revenue
 
02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
so right around a little bit over a
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars below what the governor
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
and what about two
 
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
I'll spill two I'll spill two there are
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of balls in the air I don't think
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
the large decisions have been made in
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
hospital too there was a section
 
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
approved for Corrections I.T that's
 
02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
so just for the division on Monday Mr
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hoffman will give us a and Melissa a
 
02:09:16.729 --> 02:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
breakdown of where we are and everything
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
that we've done will be grayed out be
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
like highlighted gray and the things
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
that haven't been accomplished will
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
still be white and black
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
well we do have to come up with some
 
02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
Cuts I again we still have a weaker week
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
and a half we do have a session day next
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
week we have a full committee day next
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
week so
 
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
we could I suppose wait till Monday is
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
that work for everybody and make some
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
hard decisions Monday right I mean I
 
02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.450 align:start position:0%
hard decisions Monday right I mean I
have

02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I haven't seen
 
02:09:59.330 --> 02:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
that I a budget for us in the sense that
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
division one take all your bills take
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill one take House Bill two and
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
and make it add up to X right you know I
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten there yet that's you know
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think our chairman needs to
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
give us our part of the job right he's
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
working on it okay so maybe we should
 
02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
wait on the big stuff like this until we
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
see that yeah because
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
the revenues that we saw I think
 
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
yesterday was about 130 million off the
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
governors yes proposal well if we looked
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
at the Surplus we have we wouldn't have
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
to cut anything if we wanted to go into
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Surplus well I thought the Surplus
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
no I don't think this they put in the
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
revenue it may be raw but
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
because of our Surplus and again we
 
02:10:55.729 --> 02:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
don't know what we're going to get back
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
from the Departments it hasn't been
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
spent so we're still in a pretty good
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
spot but we don't we can't really add
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
anything but we should be subtracting
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
and whether H.R 17 has
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
right so it is I think the Surplus is
 
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
no there's no apps because it's still a
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
everybody anticipates good lapses but we
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean there won't be any
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
well because the governor's he's got a
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
surplus statement of Mr Hoffman and
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
what what's the Surplus Mike is it like
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
after everything was bent and
 
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry almost 150 so it's a little
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
off yeah so
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
so oh I see yeah so it's not in there so
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying if we did nothing we just
 
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
simply wouldn't add to the rainy day
 
02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:18.649 align:start position:0%
simply wouldn't add to the rainy day
right

02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes well if we stuck with the governor's
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
plan entirely but his Revenue numbers
 
02:12:27.659 --> 02:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
plan entirely but his Revenue numbers
are

02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
are higher by a 130 million
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
but what about all our hospitals
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
well those haven't been figured in yet
 
02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:38.209 align:start position:0%
well those haven't been figured in yet
right

02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
oh yeah oh because the way I always
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
thought no
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
what I hadn't heard from from you guys
 
02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:47.689 align:start position:0%
what I hadn't heard from from you guys
is

02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
the house bills
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
plus House Bill one plus House Bill 2
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
minus HR
 
02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:58.069 align:start position:0%
minus HR
17.

02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
um and not changing the rainy day fund
 
02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
there's about 130 million sure is that
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
that sounds about right but I think Mr
 
02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
Keynes that's what I heard from Mr
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
Speaker his suggestion was that it um if
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's something you want to do in a
 
02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:18.530 align:start position:0%
there's something you want to do in a
bill

02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
finding a Mountain House Bill too that
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
to stay within the
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
in the range
 
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right so so if we cut to what say is
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
an easy example if we cut 25 million
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
from the housing that would give us
 
02:13:35.569 --> 02:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to fund all these house
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
bills that we're working on which don't
 
02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:40.820 align:start position:0%
add up to it except for
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
571 which is 84 million
 
02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
but but I thought when I asked Mr Kane
 
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
the question I said add the house bills
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
add House Bill one add House Bill 2
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
subtract H.R 17.
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
so don't change the rainy day fund and
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
what's left and he said to me so you
 
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:08.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:11.689 --> 02:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll have all the sheets it'll
 
02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
make a lot more sense once we have the
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that they're working on
 
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
what we've done all the Departments
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's always if we just focus on
 
02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
each day but if you start looking at the
 
02:14:29.569 --> 02:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
full picture it gets very common well
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean personally I would like I
 
02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
like making cuts from policy so we can
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
have the communications tax cut so we
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
can put more in the rainy day fund stuff
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
like that I thought you didn't like the
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
well if there was more there
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
then we can yeah all right escort
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
less asking all right let's ask but
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're right I mean
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah because if we go forward and cut
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
the communications tax and you're losing
 
02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
what 28 million dollars a year that's
 
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
right which but that's in the governor's
 
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
bud that's in his budget but it doesn't
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
mean we have to accept that as as Ways
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Means hasn't accepted it
 
02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:22.490 align:start position:0%
and Means hasn't accepted it
yeah

02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
but it's your housing money so well so
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
this is a question for representative
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
Sweeney perhaps but
 
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I somebody made the comment to me if
 
02:15:35.689 --> 02:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
you don't have any tax cuts that's a
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
hundred Republican votes for the budget
 
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
that go away
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
and so baby that you know well we're all
 
02:15:43.679 --> 02:15:46.010 align:start position:0%
and so baby that you know well we're all
walking

02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah okay because we're walking a very
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
tight rope obviously we have you folks
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
had a good day yesterday I
 
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney up quite a few
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
but we have so many competing interests
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be fair on both sides and I'm sure
 
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
when the budget comes up for about
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
people will be wheeled in wheelchairs
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
for that day but but I think that's why
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
the governor put in the communication
 
02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
tax it's the smallest one right so well
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's but the easiest to collect you know
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
we heard that oh yeah there's only a
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
half a person that collects 28 million
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
we didn't did we ask the question what's
 
02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
the hardest text to collect I don't know
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
as he explained it the half person it's
 
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's it is complex they go into the
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
insurance things and have to determine
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
the difference between texts and data
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
right well
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see it on the on in HR 7
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
. so in hr7 the number for 2023 was
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
39 million
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
but after they've they have a better
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
look at it it's down to 29 million
 
02:17:19.129 --> 02:17:19.139 align:start position:0%
right so two years ago they thought the
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
communication tax was a was a 10 million
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
dollar better than it actually is
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
right so there's another reason to get
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
would you like to join us why sure okay
 
02:18:07.129 --> 02:18:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
only hurts for a little while
 
02:18:09.179 --> 02:18:11.690 align:start position:0%
only hurts for a little while
whatever

02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:19.429 align:start position:0%
whatever
okay

02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%

the demographics of our state and how
 
03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
they're changing our mean age is rising
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
currently one-third of New Hampshire's
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
population is over age 55.

at 4.3 percent of our population
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
Bea's population projections published
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
in September suggest that by the year
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
2050 close to 12 percent of our state's
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
population will be 80 and older
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
this fries is said to have a significant
 
03:41:38.330 --> 03:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
impact Upon Our State how are
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%

County and state budgets
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%

and communities in response to these
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
03:42:01.490 --> 03:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
so um just as I'm sure you're interested
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
in the numbers so to shift it to a
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of the Commission on Aging
 
03:42:05.040 --> 03:42:06.889 align:start position:0%

um I just have four bullet points one
 
03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
where we are a small But Mighty agency
 
03:42:14.690 --> 03:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
with a 1.57 staff with very basic office
 
03:42:17.809 --> 03:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
operations uh you can see that the the
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
everything I provided to use prevent uh
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
printed in black and white that's about
 
03:42:23.809 --> 03:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
what I have funding for
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
um 83 um percent of the of the fiscal
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
year 24 budget before you and 84 of the
 
03:42:32.450 --> 03:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 budget is for salary and
 
03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:33.650 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 budget is for salary and
benefits

03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh there is a staffing increase in the
 
03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2425 budget for a 0.4 FTE or
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
15 hours a week person
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
um these hours will be utilized for
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
administrative support and policy
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
analysis to improve the the quality the
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
quantity and quality of services
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
outlined in RSA 19p.2 and align with the
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission goals that are in the budget
 
03:43:00.769 --> 03:43:00.779 align:start position:0%
documents one through four uh funding
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
will allow me more to uh this one will
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
allow me to more focus on the role of an
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
executive director writing Grant
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
proposals to bring additional resources
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
creating the desired impact of
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
commission the Department's operating
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
budget increases over from fiscal year
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year I mean fiscal year 23 to
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 beyond the Staffing to
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate a planning consultant for
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
strategic planning that we hope
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
um you will engage in we hope to do this
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
over the this coming summer when the
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
commission first met we did a quick
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
strategic map of of what areas to
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
investigate and at this point we're
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
ready to Embark Upon A a master plan or
 
03:43:46.610 --> 03:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
a multi-sectoral plan on Aging it's a
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
long year a long-term 10-year plan to
 
03:43:51.490 --> 03:43:51.500 align:start position:0%
think about what our state needs to do
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
to address this demographic ship we hope
 
03:43:56.690 --> 03:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
to engage policy leaders we hope to
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
engage other state leaders across the
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
state on over this coming summer
 
03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and then the only other shifts to the
 
03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
budget really are are because we're a
 
03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
relatively new agency and we're still
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
establishing the ground rules for what
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
our budget is
 
03:44:15.410 --> 03:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
um there's a new interagency transferred
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
to doit in class 27 that was added in
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
this biennium budget there's a fiscal
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
year 24 transfers to other agencies like
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
General Services has increased
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
significantly since prior budgets and
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
might have
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
I know representative McGuire has a
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
question he said we should approve your
 
03:44:37.130 --> 03:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
budget if you can stop his aging process
 
03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:39.769 align:start position:0%
budget if you can stop his aging process
[Laughter]

03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:44:43.010 --> 03:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.570 --> 03:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
when I was in my 20s I thought by now
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
there would be no hair on my head but
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
because it was essentially the same
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
amount it was a slightly different color
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
but it was a similar amount anyway
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
um so what's the difference between the
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
commission and citizen commissioners
 
03:45:06.650 --> 03:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
so the members of the commission are
 
03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
um there's two Representatives
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
um McKay and McMahon there's one Senator
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
who's uh is uh centered again in this
 
03:45:20.450 --> 03:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
year there are eight state agency reps
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the RSA
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so there's from from various state
 
03:45:24.180 --> 03:45:25.790 align:start position:0%
um so there's from from various state
agencies

03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and then we have the remaining 13
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
members of the commission are appointed
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
by the governor and their mix of uh
 
03:45:34.130 --> 03:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
regular people in the community who are
 
03:45:36.769 --> 03:45:36.779 align:start position:0%
aging like all of us as well as people
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
who work in the field of Aging Services
 
03:45:41.710 --> 03:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
so so you have people who are
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
specialists in geriatrics
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe we have a physician
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
currently on that commission but they're
 
03:45:51.050 --> 03:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
they're spent when I say from the field
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
there are people who um work in the
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels programs who work at the
 
03:45:58.370 --> 03:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
cap programs
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
um who else do we have uh
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I should look at my own list
 
03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:04.490 align:start position:0%
um I should look at my own list
um

03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have somebody from who works at uh
 
03:46:08.750 --> 03:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
who's uh who's a population Health
 
03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:10.250 align:start position:0%
who's uh who's a population Health
person

03:46:10.250 --> 03:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:46:12.050 --> 03:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
um from a hospital that's our chair Sue
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
Ruka she's a pretty impressive person
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
has done a lot of amazing work up in the
 
03:46:17.809 --> 03:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
North Conway area
 
03:46:17.819 --> 03:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
North Conway area
um

03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
um those types of folks okay so yeah I
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
mean do you think you should have like
 
03:46:30.410 --> 03:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
required a physician of some kind
 
03:46:30.420 --> 03:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
required a physician of some kind
um

03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:32.690 --> 03:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think it that would be a bad
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
choice I think that it could enhance the
 
03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
choice I think that it could enhance the
commission

03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:46:37.490 --> 03:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
um to have somebody with that that
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
Health background because
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
we all want to age healthy that's for
 
03:46:44.809 --> 03:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
sure and the other piece of it is is you
 
03:46:47.450 --> 03:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
know there's so much to be done to ready
 
03:46:49.490 --> 03:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
our our communities uh there's a
 
03:46:49.500 --> 03:46:50.570 align:start position:0%
our our communities uh there's a
movement

03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
movement
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
um for how
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
um age-friendly Health Systems it you
 
03:46:57.170 --> 03:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
would look at who goes to our hospitals
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
and you would think that of course that
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know they would be geared up like
 
03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
any other organization to
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
um uh cater to older adults but that's
 
03:47:08.090 --> 03:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
you know they're big bureaucracies and
 
03:47:09.170 --> 03:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
they aren't and they have to do special
 
03:47:11.450 --> 03:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh to change the way that
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
they do the business to really best
 
03:47:15.050 --> 03:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
serve older adults I mean we've all been
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
in there we've all seen that so having
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
somebody from that Healthcare
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
perspective would help us address that a
 
03:47:22.670 --> 03:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
bit more we at one point did have the
 
03:47:26.170 --> 03:47:26.180 align:start position:0%
CEO from Cross County Family Medicine
 
03:47:29.150 --> 03:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
who was on the commission
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
um we just his time was time to turn the
 
03:47:36.170 --> 03:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.010 --> 03:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
I just have one quick question so all
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
these appointed citizen Commissioners
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
none of them are compensated for
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
anything not nothing whatsoever they
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't even get travel
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
at their level of commitment is just
 
03:47:56.570 --> 03:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
amazing they every single one of them is
 
03:47:58.130 --> 03:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
very engaged in this work and works very
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
hard at their task
 
03:48:06.530 --> 03:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
ing representative cambrell's or numbers
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
me and over there nothing okay
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we'll I guess check
 
03:48:17.090 --> 03:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
this box and you'll be all set thank you
 
03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
so now what I thought we might be able
 
03:48:44.090 --> 03:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
to do is uh go back into perhaps hb2 is
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
that all right with you representative
 
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
McGuire it's fine with me
 
03:48:50.450 --> 03:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
um we got an hour right yeah we got an
 
03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:55.969 align:start position:0%
um we got an hour right yeah we got an
hour

03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:58.490 --> 03:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we uh things are a little
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
clearer than mud here but one of the
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
things we
 
03:49:04.010 --> 03:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
heard its session yesterday is that Ways
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
and Means came out with their revenue
 
03:49:09.290 --> 03:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
estimates and
 
03:49:11.690 --> 03:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
they did not act on the governor's
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
Communications tax proposal that cut 28
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
million and 24 and roughly 28 million
 
03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
actually it's 28.9 but
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh in 25
 
03:49:29.210 --> 03:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
the LBA has been working as those cuts
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
have actually occurred
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
I just learned that this morning so they
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
they've kind of been using that as a
 
03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:37.309 align:start position:0%
they've kind of been using that as a
number

03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
going for it so it's about 56 million
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
dollars I know representative
 
03:49:46.190 --> 03:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
McGuire would probably like to move to
 
03:49:49.370 --> 03:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
support removing
 
03:49:51.290 --> 03:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah the sections dealing with the
 
03:49:53.210 --> 03:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
communications tax
 
03:49:56.929 --> 03:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
so yeah so this is sections 102 through
 
03:49:56.939 --> 03:50:02.290 align:start position:0%
so yeah so this is sections 102 through
110.

03:50:02.290 --> 03:50:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.370 --> 03:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.130 --> 03:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
we have two seconds
 
03:50:13.140 --> 03:50:15.650 align:start position:0%
we have two seconds
foreign

03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.660 --> 03:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
could you clear look clerk has a
 
03:50:20.399 --> 03:50:21.130 align:start position:0%
could you clear look clerk has a
question

03:50:21.130 --> 03:50:21.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be should we
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
should we take action on this before we
 
03:50:30.650 --> 03:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
assess the other moving parts that we're
 
03:50:36.530 --> 03:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
I mean we could or
 
03:50:41.279 --> 03:50:42.170 align:start position:0%
I mean we could or
um

03:50:42.170 --> 03:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would you like to
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:48.229 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
yeah

03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:50:50.090 --> 03:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
03:50:52.729 --> 03:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
some tax cut and this is kind of the the
 
03:50:54.530 --> 03:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
minimum I mean just to speak from a
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
political point of view some tax cut is
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
going to be important to get a lot get a
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
good chunk of votes for the budget and
 
03:51:03.769 --> 03:51:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of the minimum
 
03:51:03.779 --> 03:51:05.389 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of the minimum
possible

03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:51:07.550 --> 03:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I would think
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
um all the other numbers on this budget
 
03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
page are much larger than this one
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
um it's so and it's something that the
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
governor has already approved so
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
therefore it's already in the bottom
 
03:51:19.439 --> 03:51:20.750 align:start position:0%
therefore it's already in the bottom
line

03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:51:23.090 --> 03:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
um it's not in it's not in ways and
 
03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
means it's bottom line because they
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh they just operate off of current law
 
03:51:31.849 --> 03:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
so that's why they put the number in but
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
they themselves have a bill that does
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
exactly this that they retained so they
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
kind of dumped it in our lap
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
so I think we should do it
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
to add to that
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
we get testimony the other day on the
 
03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:51.050 align:start position:0%
we get testimony the other day on the
difficulty

03:51:51.050 --> 03:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
collecting this tax a lot of it
 
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
goes to large corporations and
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
they have to sort out
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
what's data
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
what's uh data from
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know other transfers Within
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
what's phone and
 
03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
and covered by the tax versus data
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
transfers and video transfers
 
03:52:16.979 --> 03:52:18.429 align:start position:0%
transfers and video transfers
that

03:52:18.429 --> 03:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
are so typical of the internet today and
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's likely only going to get more
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
complex so
 
03:52:29.290 --> 03:52:29.300 align:start position:0%
given the difficulty of
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
broadening these
 
03:52:33.889 --> 03:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
companies and coming up with realistic
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
numbers on whatso
 
03:52:39.410 --> 03:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
I think we could put the uh
 
03:52:42.830 --> 03:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
free up to half a man that does this and
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
have them do more productive things in
 
03:52:45.359 --> 03:52:47.450 align:start position:0%
have them do more productive things in
Revenue

03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
03:52:50.889 --> 03:52:50.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Griffin further
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney famous chairman just
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Griffin's
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
comments uh projections for the return
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
on this tax are just diminishing across
 
03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
the board and as more and more phone
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
calls are made using data and not
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
sell not actual phone service the
 
03:53:13.010 --> 03:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
ability for us to collect this tax under
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines diminishes even
 
03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:17.330 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines diminishes even
further

03:53:17.330 --> 03:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:53:19.610 --> 03:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so I I would support the repeal I
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a smart move for us to
 
03:53:23.690 --> 03:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
do this now so that we can then have the
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
clear picture of what we have to budget
 
03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:29.889 align:start position:0%
clear picture of what we have to budget
with

03:53:29.889 --> 03:53:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.530 --> 03:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions that like
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that would satisfy the
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
situation because it would save 30
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.190 --> 03:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin followed by well
 
03:53:57.889 --> 03:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
the testimony the other day
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh basically said that they'll be
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
continued Revenue even if we just
 
03:54:05.809 --> 03:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
continue the tax because
 
03:54:10.130 --> 03:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
the audits on uh previous years on these
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
larger companies will continue for a
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
period of years
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not like
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
it won't produce any Revenue which is
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
represent grass yeah one of the concerns
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
that I have is that you know you talk
 
03:54:30.530 --> 03:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
about we want to eliminate attacks but
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
then we have to find an expenditure
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's equal to that amount that to
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
eliminate as well and I know one of the
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
discussions we have this morning was to
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate housing funds and I'm opposed
 
03:54:41.570 --> 03:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
to the elimination of the housing funds
 
03:54:43.490 --> 03:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
and so I would be opposed to the
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
elimination of this this tax unless you
 
03:54:47.090 --> 03:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
can tell me someplace else you want to
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
take this money from
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I think you you eliminate
 
03:54:52.729 --> 03:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
something something's got to be cut and
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
when we've got priorities such as
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire I don't think
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is the place to go at least not at
 
03:55:03.530 --> 03:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions so
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be clear this is a repeal the
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
communications tax starting its section
 
03:55:22.189 --> 03:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct representative McGuire
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
Maria when the clerk is ready please
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
call the roll okay I just want to
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
this is a motion to repeal the
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
communications tax that is in sections
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
101 to 110. representative McGuire moved
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
and Sweeney seconded yeah is that right
 
03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
it would be basically supporting what's
 
03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 in those sections okay
 
03:55:51.530 --> 03:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
supporting it okay sorry that's why I
 
03:55:51.540 --> 03:55:54.469 align:start position:0%
supporting it okay sorry that's why I
reiterate

03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:57.290 --> 03:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay
 
03:55:57.300 --> 03:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay
uh

03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:02.570 --> 03:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative Maguire yes
 
03:56:04.370 --> 03:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative Campbells yes
 
03:56:12.530 --> 03:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt yes
 
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
the clerk votes no representative
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
leishman yes
 
03:56:25.370 --> 03:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay so the final vote is one two three
 
03:56:29.090 --> 03:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
four five six six to two and uh the
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.130 --> 03:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
for other suggestions representative
 
03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:35.450 align:start position:0%
for other suggestions representative
McGuire

03:56:35.450 --> 03:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
um how about have we taken care of the
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have not
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
we have the one we have to take the 15
 
03:56:47.150 --> 03:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
out because we have the separate bill Mr
 
03:56:49.969 --> 03:56:49.979 align:start position:0%
Hoffman we have an amendment to delete
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
the parking garage from House Bill 2
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
with the thought that the bill would
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
proceed quickly through the process
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay so has someone voted House Bill 384
 
03:57:05.929 --> 03:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or yeah we did remember
 
03:57:08.330 --> 03:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
you were the Lone Wolf oh so so it's all
 
03:57:10.610 --> 03:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
done then yeah yeah it's going it's on
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
the agenda for next week
 
03:57:16.370 --> 03:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
departure pass amended right and so has
 
03:57:19.969 --> 03:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
the section of House Bill 2 been
 
03:57:19.979 --> 03:57:21.349 align:start position:0%
the section of House Bill 2 been
removed

03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
removed
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes we have an amendment to delete those
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
two sections
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
and we approve that amount yes oh so
 
03:57:29.689 --> 03:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's all done okay
 
03:57:32.090 --> 03:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it I think
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all right that was part of the
 
03:57:34.319 --> 03:57:36.050 align:start position:0%
yeah all right that was part of the
overall

03:57:36.050 --> 03:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so there'll be an amendment that
 
03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
will be forthcoming next week Monday or
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
whatever for the elimination of the 15
 
03:57:44.929 --> 03:57:44.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was in house bill
 
03:57:44.939 --> 03:57:46.370 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was in house bill
2.

03:57:46.370 --> 03:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
2.
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have a packet with all the
 
03:57:51.050 --> 03:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
house bill two amendments
 
03:57:56.269 --> 03:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.969 --> 03:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
now any other sections of House Bill 2
 
03:58:00.290 --> 03:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
that you would
 
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
oh I can discuss or anybody else on the
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
division are there any Granite place
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.550 --> 03:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
all right well I'm looking at this paper
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's the wrong paper but anyway yeah
 
03:58:22.370 --> 03:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's uh so rep for representative grassy
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
we have a sheet here you'll get good
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.170 --> 03:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
quick learning questions
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
still overwhelmed well we don't have
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
enough to get all shuffled in that's
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
true we're still all learning too
 
03:58:43.490 --> 03:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
Granite places section 75 page 31.
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.210 --> 03:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
right so it's
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
75 and 76.
 
03:58:56.520 --> 03:58:58.130 align:start position:0%
75 and 76.
um

03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:01.490 --> 03:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess assuming that the parking
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
garage is a done deal then this is kind
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
of a done deal too it's a
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's my I guess you're good to see
 
03:59:07.680 --> 03:59:08.530 align:start position:0%
that's my I guess you're good to see
that

03:59:08.530 --> 03:59:08.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:10.849 --> 03:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
so we might as well approve but thank
 
03:59:10.859 --> 03:59:11.809 align:start position:0%
so we might as well approve but thank
you

03:59:11.809 --> 03:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
all right so I had a thought on this I
 
03:59:20.090 --> 03:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it from the arpa
 
03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:24.410 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it from the arpa
standpoint

03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
03:59:26.090 --> 03:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's worth it or not
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
03:59:35.090 --> 03:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
we can ask the commissioner if our
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
performance would be available for that
 
03:59:39.000 --> 03:59:40.969 align:start position:0%
performance would be available for that
purchase

03:59:40.969 --> 03:59:40.979 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
is that the yeah please
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
just follow up so I mean the way that um
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
the way that the youth the YDC is
 
03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
written it says if there's federal funds
 
03:59:57.650 --> 03:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
available they could first be used arpa
 
04:00:00.170 --> 04:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
funds and then General funds so I don't
 
04:00:01.969 --> 04:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
know if we would want to consider doing
 
04:00:05.689 --> 04:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
04:00:10.250 --> 04:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
I mean if we could get the arpa funds
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you guys heard what I
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
just said so all right they're available
 
04:00:15.840 --> 04:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
just said so all right they're available
right

04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
but I just the way he talked on Friday I
 
04:00:23.570 --> 04:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
don't know how fast they would put it
 
04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
through the process but we could ask and
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
if he thinks it's going to take a while
 
04:00:28.969 --> 04:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
we could just write it the way they did
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
for you I just see
 
04:00:30.540 --> 04:00:35.689 align:start position:0%
for you I just see
it

04:00:35.689 --> 04:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.570 --> 04:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
I mean the other thing was the other
 
04:00:40.490 --> 04:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
thing was that the last time we put
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
money into affordable housing it was our
 
04:00:42.600 --> 04:00:44.570 align:start position:0%
money into affordable housing it was our
performance

04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
performance
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.779 --> 04:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
00

04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
so uh probably the best thing to do
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
would be starting on page one of the
 
04:01:13.010 --> 04:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
by pages
 
04:01:16.269 --> 04:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
I think we've already done
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
yeah starting from the top I suppose
 
04:01:21.410 --> 04:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
you're easier
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
so we've already done one and two and Mr
 
04:01:26.809 --> 04:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hoffman and Melissa correct me if I'm
 
04:01:26.819 --> 04:01:29.090 align:start position:0%
Hoffman and Melissa correct me if I'm
wrong

04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.100 --> 04:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:32.210 --> 04:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
we have the Liquor Commission funds for
 
04:01:32.220 --> 04:01:33.469 align:start position:0%
we have the Liquor Commission funds for
incentive

04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes it sounds like we did something
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
about that right now that was accepted
 
04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
all the way
 
04:01:42.889 --> 04:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
the entire first page has been accepted
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
what about the PCB assistance down
 
04:01:52.809 --> 04:01:52.819 align:start position:0%
third section 38. that's on page
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.689 --> 04:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
yeah representative evil had something
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.220 --> 04:02:10.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
so one that's well so these are
 
04:02:15.410 --> 04:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
conflating a couple of issues but um I
 
04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
did do you remember I talked to the
 
04:02:20.809 --> 04:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
director about maybe being you being
 
04:02:24.170 --> 04:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
able to use part of the PCB 6 million
 
04:02:27.889 --> 04:02:27.899 align:start position:0%
for pfas but he
 
04:02:27.899 --> 04:02:29.630 align:start position:0%
for pfas but he
um

04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
he said that that was really a decision
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
to be made by the Water Division so I
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
haven't really pursued that but
 
04:02:39.769 --> 04:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I talked to him
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
about is that remember I don't know if
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
you all read the letter that came from
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
from wimsat that sort of uh spelled out
 
04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
the money that was in the pfas funds did
 
04:02:54.170 --> 04:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
you print that out for them you may not
 
04:02:55.729 --> 04:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
have yeah
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we should see that but
 
04:03:00.410 --> 04:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
another comp because there was a bill
 
04:03:03.050 --> 04:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
that wanted to appropriate another it
 
04:03:05.929 --> 04:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
was HB 212 a one to appropriate another
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
two million dollars
 
04:03:12.290 --> 04:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
for pfas investigation so I talked to
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
the director and they may be able to
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
expand the use of the existing funds for
 
04:03:18.000 --> 04:03:18.889 align:start position:0%
expand the use of the existing funds for
that

04:03:18.889 --> 04:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:22.250 --> 04:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
all of which is to say that the I think
 
04:03:25.250 --> 04:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
they prefer to leave the PCB 6 million
 
04:03:25.260 --> 04:03:27.530 align:start position:0%
they prefer to leave the PCB 6 million
intact

04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
intact
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
all right so you'll get something to us
 
04:03:31.010 --> 04:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
on that so I'm going to work on
 
04:03:35.330 --> 04:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment with Des on the on the pfas
 
04:03:35.340 --> 04:03:37.790 align:start position:0%
Amendment with Des on the on the pfas
issue

04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
I was tasked with speaking to
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative renzullo about this
 
04:03:43.319 --> 04:03:45.590 align:start position:0%
representative renzullo about this
section

04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the you know the chair of the
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
resources department
 
04:03:48.479 --> 04:03:49.849 align:start position:0%
resources department
and

04:03:49.849 --> 04:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
um he thought he didn't like the the the
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
the way this is written he thought it
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
was too too vague too general you know
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
similar complaint that we had on that
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
that other thing about the
 
04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
broad rule making and so he would have
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
much rather see it as a bill
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
and come before his committee and they
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
can put in limits and and more specifics
 
04:04:17.340 --> 04:04:18.710 align:start position:0%
can put in limits and and more specifics
so

04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:18.720 --> 04:04:19.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
he thought we could safely uh eliminate
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
this section
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
but that section is it's
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.969 --> 04:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
38 7 38 39.
 
04:04:34.979 --> 04:04:35.809 align:start position:0%
38 7 38 39.
um

04:04:35.809 --> 04:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:39.650 --> 04:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
but if I I speaking at lunch the
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative grassy has a different
 
04:04:47.689 --> 04:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
represent grassy yeah I mean I mean one
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the things is that there were two
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
ways of looking at the pfas money I mean
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
whether they could fit it into some of
 
04:04:56.450 --> 04:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
their existing programs or not I'm not
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
sure but uh certainly uh Des when
 
04:05:03.290 --> 04:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
they're doing this they get standards
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
down from the EPA and when you know I
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't think the committee needs to see
 
04:05:09.650 --> 04:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
this in fact actually there's been
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
discussion in the past that it's
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
probably not you know they don't want
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the committee to set the standards
 
04:05:16.729 --> 04:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
because Des sets their own standards on
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
these things but they need the funding
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
to do the initial investigations and to
 
04:05:24.170 --> 04:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
the scientific research to get this
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
stuff done so I would I would support
 
04:05:30.410 --> 04:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
some funding being left in the in the
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
program not necessarily all of the
 
04:05:35.150 --> 04:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
funding but I and and I think that what
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel has said is that
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
she's working with particularly Mike
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
winstat we may be able to get a better
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
indication the first of the week on this
 
04:05:44.330 --> 04:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
if we can get uh some information back
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
on from them
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
all right we'll hold on that for a
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
couple of days and then moving to page
 
04:05:54.769 --> 04:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
to the top of two we have section 40.
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we heard a little about that with
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell I believe the
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
office of regulatory review would be a
 
04:06:01.080 --> 04:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
office of regulatory review would be a
new

04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department I think something that caught
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
my eye on the
 
04:06:13.729 --> 04:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
section 41 was the appropriation of 750
 
04:06:17.150 --> 04:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
000 is per year yeah per year and I
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't think there was any plan of number
 
04:06:22.849 --> 04:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
employees or I think it represented yeah
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
I think I think it was seven if I
 
04:06:26.450 --> 04:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
remember right
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to Carol about this one
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
because it's about rule making right and
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
getting people to
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
review rules from the point of view of
 
04:06:41.570 --> 04:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
business I guess and um and comment on
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
them and stuff like that but
 
04:06:44.160 --> 04:06:45.889 align:start position:0%
them and stuff like that but
um

04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
personally I I think we should eliminate
 
04:06:51.889 --> 04:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
this section 40 and 41.
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
because to me it's like
 
04:06:58.490 --> 04:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
we we have we hire people to make room
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
to write rules so they and we have a
 
04:07:03.769 --> 04:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that very
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
carefully reads through rules and makes
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
sure that they comport with law
 
04:07:10.080 --> 04:07:11.389 align:start position:0%
sure that they comport with law
um but

04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
but this is hiring new people
 
04:07:14.479 --> 04:07:16.250 align:start position:0%
but this is hiring new people
to

04:07:16.250 --> 04:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
um to complain about rules you know what
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
I mean it's like it's like we hire
 
04:07:22.729 --> 04:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
people to do a job and then we hire some
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
other people to complain about the job I
 
04:07:28.250 --> 04:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
mean it's like you know no disrespect to
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative you are but it's like
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
that old joke you know one low air in
 
04:07:35.290 --> 04:07:35.300 align:start position:0%
town starves and two of them uh you know
 
04:07:39.530 --> 04:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
live very well you know so I I just
 
04:07:42.110 --> 04:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it makes sense
 
04:07:45.370 --> 04:07:45.380 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire is supporting
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
when you
 
04:07:51.889 --> 04:07:51.899 align:start position:0%
remove this section take it out yes I
 
04:07:53.150 --> 04:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
mean it's not a big it's not a big
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money I think it's a million
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
and a half yeah I agree with that I
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
think this is just more growth of
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
government we don't need it
 
04:08:04.849 --> 04:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay it's unanimous we don't need to
 
04:08:09.410 --> 04:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
take a vote again okay wait the clerk
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
needs to get this note taken okay wait
 
04:08:14.210 --> 04:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
sucks there's a lot of things going on
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
so Melissa yeah
 
04:08:21.889 --> 04:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
40 and 41. so we pick up 750 000 a year
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:08:33.530 --> 04:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
so the new subdivision next 42 historic
 
04:08:36.410 --> 04:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
housing preservation tax credit
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:51.130 --> 04:08:51.140 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.340 --> 04:09:05.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:05.410 --> 04:09:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
so this is a new Senate 231 the bill
 
04:09:12.290 --> 04:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
with the other money that's correct oh
 
04:09:12.300 --> 04:09:14.389 align:start position:0%
with the other money that's correct oh
okay

04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
so the wishes of the division
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
let me read this so this is uh it's 18
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
and 19.
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember if we had anyone
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
speak to this that's coming I don't
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.650 --> 04:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
I have a note next to this one
 
04:10:03.720 --> 04:10:04.729 align:start position:0%
I have a note next to this one
um

04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
possible referral to Ways and Means with
 
04:10:08.990 --> 04:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
a question mark
 
04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
I think one of the members suggested
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd want to look at that tax
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
credit yeah all right representative
 
04:10:17.330 --> 04:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
Maguire had suggested
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
I understand McGuire
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
this is something like the
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax credit I
 
04:10:35.689 --> 04:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
think right you what this is is
 
04:10:37.610 --> 04:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
um a tax credit
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
against I'm not even sure which tax oh
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's a list of taxes so this is
 
04:10:45.650 --> 04:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
probably b-e-t BPT and interest in
 
04:10:47.410 --> 04:10:47.420 align:start position:0%
dividends is that what it is it's uh
 
04:10:49.570 --> 04:10:49.580 align:start position:0%
b-e-tbt and insurance premium tax
 
04:10:52.849 --> 04:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax so this this
 
04:10:56.450 --> 04:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
language was mirrored after the cdfa
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
tax credit language
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
and that one includes the insurance
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
premium taxes in there during Senate
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
Finance they were asking that question
 
04:11:04.680 --> 04:11:05.929 align:start position:0%
Finance they were asking that question
why

04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
with insurance premium tax included
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know how that would
 
04:11:12.110 --> 04:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
factor into receiving credit on taxes if
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies were going to donate
 
04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
to get donate to this historic housing
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
tax try to make a contribution and then
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
get a credit against their tax and there
 
04:11:21.889 --> 04:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
really wasn't an answer for it except
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that it was mirrored after cdfa
 
04:11:26.210 --> 04:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
and what is CDF I'm sorry Community
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Authority
 
04:11:31.969 --> 04:11:31.979 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
04:11:33.650 --> 04:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm
 
04:11:33.660 --> 04:11:35.510 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm
yes

04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
ship it over to wasted means please
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
maybe get a read on it yeah that's right
 
04:11:53.170 --> 04:11:53.180 align:start position:0%
this is I was supposed to call them
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and I didn't do it yeah okay so
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
ask Gloria well thank you
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
they'd be happy to take it over there
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
all right so that would take us down
 
04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
then to appropriation for invest New
 
04:12:17.340 --> 04:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
then to appropriation for invest New
Hampshire

04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes represents on the invest New
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the affordable housing
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
fund I I'll kind of sign up for to talk
 
04:12:30.170 --> 04:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
to the special committee on housing
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
about their views on it and I think
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
there has been conversations about
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
having two offices administer funds that
 
04:12:40.010 --> 04:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
can go sorted to the same area but not
 
04:12:40.020 --> 04:12:41.689 align:start position:0%
can go sorted to the same area but not
exactly

04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:12:41.699 --> 04:12:42.469 align:start position:0%
exactly
um

04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
I mean there's there's works there's
 
04:12:47.090 --> 04:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
ways to work here to
 
04:12:49.450 --> 04:12:49.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know to me speaking for myself
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
having one office focused on invest in
 
04:12:55.849 --> 04:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
age where it's just housing across the
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
board funding and then the affordable
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing which is for the actual
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing units
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
where invest in age can go to large
 
04:13:08.210 --> 04:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
developers who aren't affordable I kind
 
04:13:10.849 --> 04:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
of want to iron all those issues out and
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
talk with the special Committee just to
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
get their taste on things before we make
 
04:13:17.090 --> 04:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
any recommendations
 
04:13:20.090 --> 04:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
all right so we have representative
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
Sweeney looking at sections 43 through
 
04:13:24.120 --> 04:13:27.050 align:start position:0%
Sweeney looking at sections 43 through
48.

04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
48.
 
04:13:29.090 --> 04:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I was just going to add in here
 
04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
that in the past we saw the affordable
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
housing money that went to the Housing
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
Authority come through the capital
 
04:13:42.429 --> 04:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
right you know I think it's something I
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
think it's a good point representative
 
04:13:47.929 --> 04:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about here is why do
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have two departments administering
 
04:13:51.229 --> 04:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
similar amounts of monies if we could
 
04:13:52.849 --> 04:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
get both of those pools of money you
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
know put a divider line between the two
 
04:13:56.330 --> 04:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
pools put them in the same Department
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know at New Hampshire housing would
 
04:14:00.290 --> 04:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
probably be a far better location to
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
have them than to have two
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
administrations differing up separately
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's a great idea thank
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah to that point exactly because
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds like New Hampshire housing is
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
working with developers on their
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
projects they put together they open the
 
04:14:15.650 --> 04:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
initial plan and then they can go and
 
04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
get money from invest in h and then
 
04:14:20.210 --> 04:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
housing uses their funds separately and
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
I think getting it Under One Roof and
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
having it have the ability to make the
 
04:14:27.170 --> 04:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
full plan at once will reduce staff time
 
04:14:29.689 --> 04:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
and allow them to have more reach for
 
04:14:32.330 --> 04:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
the dollar and and in actuality you know
 
04:14:34.010 --> 04:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies and ngos have
 
04:14:35.570 --> 04:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
always worked with New Hampshire housing
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
as well right and maybe it's you know if
 
04:14:39.769 --> 04:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
they've got three three staff people one
 
04:14:41.689 --> 04:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
place you move one staff person over and
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
you've solved all the problems yeah
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.570 --> 04:14:49.580 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
grassy and Sweeney for that
 
04:14:55.729 --> 04:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
now we've already we jumped just
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh Bridges house we've acted on that
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
both 66 and 67 but the next
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
section 68 representative McGuire You
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
chair the discussion when Corrections
 
04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
was here so yeah
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
so this is a tough one because this is
 
04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
one of our biggest this if we need a cut
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
I mean this is the biggest one and it's
 
04:15:21.410 --> 04:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
fairly easy in the sense that
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's 40 million dollars
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
or 50 million dollars I guess
 
04:15:27.120 --> 04:15:28.910 align:start position:0%
or 50 million dollars I guess
um

04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
they made a pretty reasonable case I
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
mean we gave we essentially gave
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections everything they wanted
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
um but they made a fairly reasonable
 
04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
case that the prisons wearing out right
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
um at some point we've got to build a
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
new one
 
04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
but it but it is a you know it the
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
question is how urgent is it right I
 
04:15:54.410 --> 04:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
mean it's uh
 
04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
so prisons been here for eight since 18
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
something or other it's going to be here
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
for the next however many years but
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
sorry if I keep talking about public
 
04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
works but it is a cap project I mean one
 
04:16:13.250 --> 04:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the ways that we used to handle these
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
things is that um we would give them
 
04:16:18.110 --> 04:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
some money to get the design and
 
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
Engineering going without
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then once they had done their design
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
and Engineering they would come in and
 
04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
then they would make the ask of course
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
in this case the ask would probably be
 
04:16:33.050 --> 04:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars but you could give
 
04:16:33.060 --> 04:16:34.130 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars but you could give
them

04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:16:37.130 --> 04:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
something to get going or we could also
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
I can go back to Public Works and and
 
04:16:43.250 --> 04:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
and talk to them about it but um
 
04:16:45.410 --> 04:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
to give them nothing would also be
 
04:16:47.689 --> 04:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
challenging if they just want to start
 
04:16:50.809 --> 04:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
to do some design work
 
04:16:54.290 --> 04:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
further comments on that it would seem
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
to me anyway at least to give them the
 
04:16:58.130 --> 04:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars for site design
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
location and then maybe take the 40 out
 
04:17:02.150 --> 04:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
for Nano
 
04:17:03.170 --> 04:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
I mean where you were going
 
04:17:06.050 --> 04:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative that's sort of what I
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
thought but I I'm also happy to talk to
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
um chair McConkey about it or we can
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
we'll try to make a decision yeah
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
they've they've decided that it has to
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
be in Concord
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
um we asked about more more space in
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
Berlin Etc
 
04:17:26.640 --> 04:17:27.349 align:start position:0%
Berlin Etc
um

04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:29.689 --> 04:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
but yeah I guess the the design is
 
04:17:29.699 --> 04:17:31.670 align:start position:0%
but yeah I guess the the design is
important

04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:17:35.210 --> 04:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
um and but the 10 million I think is not
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
enough even to finish the design right
 
04:17:40.490 --> 04:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's well Mr Hanson said that they
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
usually base those things on square
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
footage and he thought it might be more
 
04:17:48.110 --> 04:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
like 25 million but of course 25 is also
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
a hunk
 
04:17:50.750 --> 04:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's so
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
I mean we could go back and ask him
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
I mean they they denied that I've heard
 
04:17:59.809 --> 04:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
from many sources that the women's
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
prison recently constructed was not done
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
as an efficient design right that that
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
it has more officers per per uh inmate
 
04:18:14.809 --> 04:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
than than the others and so I think
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's they found there's more places
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
to hide in there yes something like that
 
04:18:18.720 --> 04:18:20.330 align:start position:0%
to hide in there yes something like that
so

04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um hopefully they won't make that
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
mistake again with this one but I don't
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
know how to specify it you know what I
 
04:18:26.279 --> 04:18:28.689 align:start position:0%
know how to specify it you know what I
mean

04:18:28.689 --> 04:18:28.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
unless you just trust them to learn from
 
04:18:33.889 --> 04:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
things they learned from their previous
 
04:18:33.899 --> 04:18:37.429 align:start position:0%
things they learned from their previous
experience

04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
well we could put
 
04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars into 24 and again
 
04:18:46.490 --> 04:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
this will be going to the Senate maybe
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
we can get more information and take the
 
04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
40 out all together
 
04:18:54.410 --> 04:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
might be okay you'll be okay not okay
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll keep section 40 and remove
 
04:19:01.070 --> 04:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
section 41.
 
04:19:01.080 --> 04:19:05.090 align:start position:0%
section 41.
71.

04:19:05.090 --> 04:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.130 --> 04:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
right 72 or 72.
 
04:19:27.410 --> 04:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.349 --> 04:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
so I think we probably if we do that
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
we'd have to move 70 of men 70 to put in
 
04:19:35.279 --> 04:19:37.790 align:start position:0%
we'd have to move 70 of men 70 to put in
24.

04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
24.
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's yeah it's really
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
so Melissa and Mr Hoffman is a weird
 
04:19:55.150 --> 04:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
again moving the 10 million to 24
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
and taking out the 40 and 24 all
 
04:20:02.450 --> 04:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
together why not leave it in 23.
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think in general we have more 23
 
04:20:06.590 --> 04:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
dollars than we have
 
04:20:06.600 --> 04:20:09.610 align:start position:0%
dollars than we have
others

04:20:09.610 --> 04:20:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine we could do that too Mr
 
04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
you've had the same messaging that if we
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
can put it in 23 to put it in 23 because
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
there are currently more funds in 23. so
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
we can leave it there I think that's
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
probably yeah we'll do that could you
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
sort of restate where we are and I'll
 
04:20:40.490 --> 04:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
write it down so we're keeping keeping
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
sections 68 69 and 70 and removing
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
section 72.
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 68 through 71.
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
why doesn't 72 have an effective date
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's uh well it says fiscal
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
year ending in
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2024.
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that's where yes your Note is
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
oh maybe because 23 if you have money in
 
04:21:14.929 --> 04:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
23 you need an effective date because
 
04:21:14.939 --> 04:21:15.950 align:start position:0%
23 you need an effective date because
you're

04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
allocating things otherwise not
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate yeah right when the uh Draft
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 now they'll uh
 
04:21:26.990 --> 04:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't have an effective
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
date will default to July 1st 2023.
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that's
 
04:21:35.160 --> 04:21:36.469 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that's
why

04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you could be saying we'll we'll
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a show of hands okay so
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
um in hb2 under the corrections section
 
04:21:50.650 --> 04:21:50.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep section 68 to 71.
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
which is 10 million dollars
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
and then remove section 72 which is 40
 
04:21:58.020 --> 04:22:03.950 align:start position:0%
and then remove section 72 which is 40
million

04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.969 --> 04:22:06.979 align:start position:0%
all right sound good to everyone
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
04:22:12.889 --> 04:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
represent grassy okay with this or
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
kids unanimous thanks the only thing I'd
 
04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
say here is that for the 10 million it
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
says designing and constructing should
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
we just say designing or just leave it
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
yes that sounds like a good idea yeah
 
04:22:28.130 --> 04:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
because it
 
04:22:28.140 --> 04:22:34.849 align:start position:0%
because it
was designing

04:22:34.849 --> 04:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
so Melissa and Mike just a short
 
04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
amendment to see
 
04:22:52.809 --> 04:22:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.490 --> 04:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire again the
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
correction step below that you were here
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
for that the I.T infrastructure and yes
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
we I think we approved essentially all
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
of that stuff didn't we
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.150 --> 04:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
oh yeah holding on granite
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
place so representative evil can ask
 
04:23:19.010 --> 04:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
about arpa or somebody can ask about
 
04:23:21.250 --> 04:23:21.260 align:start position:0%
Barbara funds
 
04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mike could you ask
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.479 --> 04:23:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
79

04:23:34.250 --> 04:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.809 --> 04:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
so we're all set on that people listen
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.840 --> 04:24:06.610 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:24:06.610 --> 04:24:06.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
so I want to wait for 83
 
04:24:14.090 --> 04:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's a Christa McAuliffe Memorial it
 
04:24:15.769 --> 04:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
was like what 500
 
04:24:18.650 --> 04:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
ID on this is a lot of times for these
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
things they take charitable donations
 
04:24:25.550 --> 04:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
too I don't know what the total amount
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
is for the
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
if they really think five well we can
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
wait until she
 
04:24:31.620 --> 04:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
wait until she
any

04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
well it appropriates five hundred
 
04:24:36.239 --> 04:24:40.389 align:start position:0%
well it appropriates five hundred
thousand

04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
right it allows donations but it
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
appropriates yeah but it's out of the
 
04:24:47.929 --> 04:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
blocks and it appropriates 500 000. it's
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
also for the state house right
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr Hoffman and Melissa do we have a
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
new date for the commissioner to come in
 
04:24:59.110 --> 04:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
excuse me nothing I'm aware of I can run
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
across and check with Janet
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh we can I hope she'll be in next week
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
but we could probably save this for them
 
04:25:12.530 --> 04:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
but it does appear to be something that
 
04:25:13.969 --> 04:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
we ought to take a close look at
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
do we know in the past what was the
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
funding for Daniel Webster Franklin
 
04:25:23.929 --> 04:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
Pierce General Stark who funded those
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
taxes if anyone knows you would know
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't but I could ask and I can
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
tell you who funded the Lincoln picture
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
in these in the main hall
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
so uh I mean in reps Hall yeah okay so
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
the Lincoln picture is the newest one of
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
the five okay
 
04:25:41.960 --> 04:25:43.490 align:start position:0%
the five okay
and

04:25:43.490 --> 04:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:47.210 --> 04:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
um it was funded by school children
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
so what happened was we have fourth
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
graders come to this visit
 
04:25:55.969 --> 04:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
and so like in the 20s
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
um the fourth graders came and they
 
04:26:00.110 --> 04:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the pictures in reps Hall and
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
they said you don't have Lincoln he's
 
04:26:05.050 --> 04:26:05.060 align:start position:0%
the most important one you know
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
so so they started a program called
 
04:26:10.130 --> 04:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
pennies for the portrait
 
04:26:12.769 --> 04:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
and school children all over the state
 
04:26:16.010 --> 04:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
donated pennies and they raised fifteen
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and that was used to
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
paint the portrait of Lincoln wow and so
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's a gift from the school children
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to the legislature
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah so sometimes money is raised
 
04:26:32.450 --> 04:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
you can ask all the questions you want
 
04:26:32.460 --> 04:26:33.309 align:start position:0%
you can ask all the questions you want
yeah

04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
that was very interesting yeah one
 
04:26:39.170 --> 04:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
parallel thing is the um the monument is
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
it the to the state police out for the
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
lob I'm not sure we funded that I think
 
04:26:47.689 --> 04:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
that might have been contributions I'm
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
not sure yeah right out here to the left
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure but well we'll see the
 
04:26:54.769 --> 04:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner hopefully in the next week
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
and get some answers to that
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's yeah I mean we
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
could sort of informally have a policy
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
that whatever the estimate is we'll pay
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
half or something like that you know do
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
that might be kind of open-ended if we
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know well no I mean get an estimate
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
and they they say this a statue costs
 
04:27:21.889 --> 04:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
yeah a million therefore 500 yeah I'm
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
not sure why it's dncr doing this for
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
a steakhouse
 
04:27:31.610 --> 04:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
I don't recall was just supposed to be
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
on the State House grounds on State
 
04:27:36.410 --> 04:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
House grounds
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
it might be the cultural resource part
 
04:27:42.170 --> 04:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
of dncr as opposed to the parks and
 
04:27:42.180 --> 04:27:44.210 align:start position:0%
of dncr as opposed to the parks and
stuff

04:27:44.210 --> 04:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
this is a cultural thing right so well I
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
was just wondering because it's a state
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
house I mean it's artistic and I thought
 
04:27:54.530 --> 04:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll see the
 
04:27:59.090 --> 04:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner hopefully next week and
 
04:28:02.210 --> 04:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
get some questions answered there
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
so that we can skip down over 97 that's
 
04:28:09.530 --> 04:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.769 --> 04:28:14.779 align:start position:0%
we did Board of tax and land Appeals
 
04:28:17.689 --> 04:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
uh did we do the state line you know
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
so we did all the tax for the
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
communication yeah section 115
 
04:28:35.450 --> 04:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I asked the question this is the
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
second second injuries special fund well
 
04:28:41.929 --> 04:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
that's right okay so I spoke to will
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
infantine the labor committee about this
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
and he gave me the history which is that
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is a program added in World War II
 
04:28:55.490 --> 04:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
following World War II because
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
um the the idea was
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you if somebody who had previously
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
had some kind of injury later gets
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
injured on the job and it maybe
 
04:29:08.330 --> 04:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
aggravates their original injury there's
 
04:29:12.830 --> 04:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
some money here to reimburse the the
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
um workman's comp for those second
 
04:29:18.050 --> 04:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
injuries right so
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and the idea was it it would make it
 
04:29:25.969 --> 04:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
easier to hire veterans of World War II
 
04:29:28.849 --> 04:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
because some many of them had trapnel or
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
other kinds of injuries and so this this
 
04:29:31.319 --> 04:29:32.590 align:start position:0%
other kinds of injuries and so this this
therefore

04:29:32.590 --> 04:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:29:34.969 --> 04:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
employers might be reluctant to hire
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
them and and so that was the purpose of
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
this fund and
 
04:29:40.920 --> 04:29:42.110 align:start position:0%
this fund and
um

04:29:42.110 --> 04:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
and so over the years it's been
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of had a similar effect
 
04:29:51.410 --> 04:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
in the sense that maybe somebody gets
 
04:29:54.110 --> 04:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
injured on job number one and then later
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
they they try to take job number two and
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
and again because of the second injury
 
04:30:00.239 --> 04:30:01.790 align:start position:0%
and again because of the second injury
feature

04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
feature
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
it makes employer number two more likely
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
to hire them right because somebody who
 
04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
has a history of an injury might be more
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
more you know uh likely to get injured a
 
04:30:16.729 --> 04:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
second time or something like that but
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
he's anyways he told me he was going to
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
put out some feelers among people in in
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
insurance and and to see whether
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
how important the second fund is to them
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
still right it could be sort of obsolete
 
04:30:32.040 --> 04:30:33.769 align:start position:0%
still right it could be sort of obsolete
so

04:30:33.769 --> 04:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's a long way of saying we don't
 
04:30:36.670 --> 04:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
know yet
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm putting McGuire researching yeah
 
04:30:39.720 --> 04:30:47.030 align:start position:0%
I'm putting McGuire researching yeah
right

04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
I thought I would listen to them and
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
agreed with them they were going to get
 
04:30:55.929 --> 04:30:55.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh I have a note here that
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz was going to look
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
into it
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
because she was sitting there and uh
 
04:31:03.960 --> 04:31:05.870 align:start position:0%
because she was sitting there and uh
yeah

04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
all right well maybe you represent
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
Maguire you want another task well yeah
 
04:31:13.550 --> 04:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm already waiting to hear back from I
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
mean it's not only just people injured
 
04:31:17.450 --> 04:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
during World War II but you also I mean
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're mostly gone now but the ones
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
that were injured in Desert Storm yeah I
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
mean is does it still have any that
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
validity to that yeah it's it's it's
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
again it's it's for any second injury
 
04:31:31.490 --> 04:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
right it's it's it's a kind of an
 
04:31:34.490 --> 04:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
insurance among all
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
um workman's comp carriers that that
 
04:31:41.210 --> 04:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
covers second injuries that possibly
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
could be related to it to an earlier
 
04:31:45.410 --> 04:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
injury so
 
04:31:48.010 --> 04:31:48.020 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
just a a plain injury that causes you
 
04:31:55.130 --> 04:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
know something that has to be fixed
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
it could be an injury that aggravates
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
you know some anyway representative
 
04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
Griffin has something I I don't know I
 
04:32:06.530 --> 04:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure when they testified they
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
they said that Most states were getting
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
rid of these sons that they were kind of
 
04:32:12.659 --> 04:32:14.450 align:start position:0%
rid of these sons that they were kind of
obsolete

04:32:14.450 --> 04:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
obsolete
 
04:32:19.490 --> 04:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure the folks from
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
that have been sitting here probably
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to listen to us any further
 
04:32:34.849 --> 04:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.250 --> 04:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
so you're welcome to come forward this
 
04:32:40.490 --> 04:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
is a work session on Military Affairs
 
04:32:43.130 --> 04:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
and Veterans Services and I think there
 
04:32:45.769 --> 04:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
was a house bill that we had a question
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
for you upon as well but let's see if I
 
04:32:49.610 --> 04:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
can find that
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I guess you have a
 
04:32:51.600 --> 04:32:54.250 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I guess you have a
handout

04:32:54.250 --> 04:32:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
let's see 3 30 yes National Guard
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
recruiting incentive program
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
so for the record Mr chair my name is
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry I'm the deputy agent
 
04:33:06.170 --> 04:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire's Department
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
and with me is Miss Judy Chen she is the
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
administrator of Finance for the
 
04:33:12.119 --> 04:33:13.070 align:start position:0%
administrator of Finance for the
Department

04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:33:14.449 --> 04:33:14.459 align:start position:0%
we're happy to be here and happy to
 
04:33:16.730 --> 04:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
testify and ready to do you want to
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
start with that question Mr chair or do
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
you want me to go ahead and give myself
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
sure if you wanted for those looking for
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
what page it's 199 in the budget book
 
04:33:36.051 --> 04:33:36.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 330 is has three or three
 
04:33:41.090 --> 04:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
or four components one is it increases
 
04:33:44.570 --> 04:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
the amount of us of a uh incentive
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
payment to members who of current
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire National
 
04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
Guard up to the grade of Captain
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and former members of the New Hampshire
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
National Guard if they refer somebody
 
04:33:55.970 --> 04:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
who ships to their initial entry
 
04:33:57.650 --> 04:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
training be that in the Air Force or the
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
Army Air National Guard currently the
 
04:34:02.090 --> 04:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
incentive payment is at 500 it's not
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
really making the difference that we
 
04:34:05.689 --> 04:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
hoped it would make the second component
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
of that bill is that it eliminates the
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
requirement for rule making there and
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
the justification there was rulemaking
 
04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
generally applies when we talk about
 
04:34:16.369 --> 04:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
rules that apply to the entire
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
population the specifics this specific
 
04:34:21.650 --> 04:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
program only applies to current and
 
04:34:22.849 --> 04:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
former members of the New Hampshire
 
04:34:25.490 --> 04:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
National Guard so we wanted to to to do
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
away with that and off the top of my
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
head uh representative I can't remember
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
the third piece of it uh oh I know what
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
it was it was to I do remember now Judy
 
04:34:35.449 --> 04:34:35.459 align:start position:0%
just kicked me under the table so I knew
 
04:34:38.570 --> 04:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
it was going on it was uh the third part
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
of that bill is to allow for the monies
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
that are collected based on fines for
 
04:34:44.810 --> 04:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
non-judicial punishment to be applied to
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
this fund as well so we've asked for a
 
04:34:49.010 --> 04:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar appropriation in
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
this year's budget we'll talk we can
 
04:34:51.769 --> 04:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
talk about that as we go through the
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
budget but then again any other uh
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
non-judicial punishment that is levied
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
against soldiers for for disciplinary
 
04:35:00.890 --> 04:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
actions also be applied to this fund in
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
the past the non-judicial punishment
 
04:35:05.689 --> 04:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
fines went to the scholarship fund so we
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
had a New Hampshire National Guard
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and when we did away
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
with that to create this recruiting
 
04:35:12.529 --> 04:35:12.539 align:start position:0%
incentive fund and roll this program
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
roll the the Appropriations into this
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
program we just didn't clean up the
 
04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
language and the statutes to make sure
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
that that money followed so we wanted to
 
04:35:21.890 --> 04:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were able to allocate
 
04:35:23.570 --> 04:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
those that money as we go forward so
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
those were the three provisions of House
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 3 30. again in the in the
 
04:35:31.010 --> 04:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget we met
 
04:35:33.170 --> 04:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
our Target and we kept we asked for that
 
04:35:35.689 --> 04:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be increased from
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
25 000 in the last biennium to fifty
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in this biennium uh and
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
again that you know that this program is
 
04:35:45.289 --> 04:35:45.299 align:start position:0%
contingent on the will of the will of
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
the general court to approve that in the
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
budget now I see we met with uh sponsors
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
on March
 
04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
third and shows that they came out of
 
04:35:58.730 --> 04:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
the committee of
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal relations and Veterans
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%

04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
fold yes I I have a check mark on my
 
04:36:09.289 --> 04:36:09.299 align:start position:0%
page so I think we may have already
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
acted on that I know that I know that
 
04:36:12.769 --> 04:36:12.779 align:start position:0%

pretty happy about that so I'm happy to
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%

04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2. okay yeah yeah it's
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
filled up to fifty thousand dollars a
 
04:36:34.799 --> 04:36:37.689 align:start position:0%
filled up to fifty thousand dollars a
year

04:36:37.689 --> 04:36:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but you have to allocate the
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.970 --> 04:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're good see but
 
04:36:49.131 --> 04:36:49.141 align:start position:0%
that's that's good so good again members
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh good afternoon thank
 
04:36:51.529 --> 04:36:51.539 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak to you
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
this afternoon as we discuss our state
 
04:36:55.490 --> 04:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
operating budget uh for the Department
 
04:36:56.810 --> 04:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
supporting a note that we have a
 
04:36:58.250 --> 04:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
matching federal budget and they're
 
04:37:00.410 --> 04:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
complementary to each other so without
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
without the state support to this the
 
04:37:05.209 --> 04:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
National Guard really can't accomplish
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
all of its missions the two budgets have
 
04:37:10.369 --> 04:37:10.379 align:start position:0%
to complement each other or it will have
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
an adverse impact to our mission our
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
current proposal for our in our
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
operating budget submission is prudent
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable meets the governor's
 
04:37:19.730 --> 04:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget targets and we kept in
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
mind our two overarching objectives and
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is in your written testimony that I
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
passed to to Mr Hoffman supporting the
 
04:37:28.250 --> 04:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
200 million dollar federal budget at the
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%

of the New Hampshire National Guard and
 
04:37:34.250 --> 04:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
supporting our state's veteran Community
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%

approval to build an aviation facility
 
04:38:25.131 --> 04:38:25.141 align:start position:0%

appropriation of federal appropriation
 
04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
to do that and we're working through the
 
04:38:29.209 --> 04:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that we have the
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
land so we can build a hangar up there
 
04:38:34.250 --> 04:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
and that will be primarily focused at uh
 
04:38:36.410 --> 04:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
power management Aviation training in
 
04:38:38.570 --> 04:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains and it'll also you
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
know that's what that's why the federal
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
government has given us the money but it
 
04:38:43.070 --> 04:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
also will support search and rescue
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
missions which we have done a lot of in
 
04:38:47.689 --> 04:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
the last couple a couple years to pluck
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%

04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
so we do we do need to have you know we
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous operating costs
 
04:39:01.131 --> 04:39:01.141 align:start position:0%

keep the National Guard and Facilities
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
that are that enable us to support both

uh existing portfolio veteran programs
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%

the State of New Hampshire clearly uh
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
the state Cemetery provides a dignified

resting place for our our veterans uh
 
04:39:42.650 --> 04:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
and if you haven't been there it is
 
04:39:44.690 --> 04:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
unbelievably beautiful there and very
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
well maintained the staff are fantastic

connects veterans with the benefits
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
they've earned by virtue of their

compensation to the veterans each year
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire it's
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
a pretty important part of what we do
 
04:40:06.770 --> 04:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
and the division of community-based
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%

things that we continue to do
 
04:40:19.610 --> 04:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh there we do have a mission to have to
 
04:40:22.130 --> 04:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
provide uh
 
04:40:24.050 --> 04:40:24.060 align:start position:0%

04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
defend the nation uh respond to State
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
emergencies and build enduring
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships one of the things that is
 
04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
added this year is a stem program called
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
Starbase this is a DOD funded program
 
04:40:39.410 --> 04:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
primarily it's gonna we have about a
 
04:40:41.930 --> 04:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollar line of General
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
funds to support this program but the
 
04:40:47.090 --> 04:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
rest of it is about I think it's 70 750
 
04:40:50.630 --> 04:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
million uh 750 000 I'm sorry got my M's
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
and T's mixed up uh a year to support
 
04:40:54.410 --> 04:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
this program this is a stem based
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
program that will take uh fourth graders
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
and ex and expose them to stem uh under
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
the guise of uh you know under the the
 
04:41:06.050 --> 04:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
control of the National Guard and we'll
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
contract for those Services here so that
 
04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
you'll see that addition
 
04:41:13.130 --> 04:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
in summary uh uh our service men and
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
women continue to answer the nation's
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
call both at this uh both here and at
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
home in fact you may have seen the news
 
04:41:19.490 --> 04:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
and we're going to send some folks over
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
to support the Department of Corrections
 
04:41:24.050 --> 04:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
here for a couple of days uh we continue
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
to deploy to the Middle East uh We've we
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
have had in the past year deployments to
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
Iraq Syria Jordan the United Arab
 
04:41:33.288 --> 04:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
Emirates we have a contingency that
 
04:41:34.730 --> 04:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
contingency that's on the Southwest
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
border now helping uh Customs Border
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
Protection and you uh US Border
 
04:41:42.288 --> 04:41:42.298 align:start position:0%

uh

04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
we have debt we have a dedicated
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
category of state employees that support
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
our our men and women in uniform uh and
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
we're ready to you know we're ready to
 
04:41:54.050 --> 04:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
continue that support to the best of our
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
ability uh you know as the as uh the
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
need arises if you look at the third
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
page of the written testimony that uh
 
04:42:03.288 --> 04:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
that we have here those are the
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
highlights to our changes uh in our
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget from last year uh and
 
04:42:11.208 --> 04:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to go over those quickly
 
04:42:13.250 --> 04:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
with you in case you so you know what's
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
changed uh from from the last last year
 
04:42:18.890 --> 04:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
primary uh the first thing is this State
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
Fire Department that was at providing
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
fire and emergency services to peas is
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
no longer a state entity we've we
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
transitioned that entity into a federal
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
entity so we're eliminating those
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
positions it was 100 percent federally
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursed money so there's no General
 
04:42:35.570 --> 04:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
funds to be made there I know that's a
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
sad face for everybody here but but uh
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
so but it is it is uh it is the way
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've moved we're going to get about 5
 
04:42:44.570 --> 04:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
million in federal funds out of salary
 
04:42:46.810 --> 04:42:46.820 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
utilities are a nightmare for us now I
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
assume for just about everybody else so
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
you'll see those increases to our uh to
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
the lines of accounting for our
 
04:42:59.570 --> 04:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
utilities uh we do anticipate that that
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
we've peaked in utility cost at least in
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
the short term and they're starting to
 
04:43:06.410 --> 04:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
come back down but the bills uh the
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
bills are substantial so just for the
 
04:43:08.280 --> 04:43:09.230 align:start position:0%
bills are substantial so just for the
last

04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
two months three months the last three
 
04:43:13.010 --> 04:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
months at peace Air National Guard base
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
the cost just to keep the lights on was
 
04:43:17.330 --> 04:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
about 285
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
000 a month
 
04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money to keep the lights
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
on representative McGuire has a question
 
04:43:24.770 --> 04:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah are you
 
04:43:27.050 --> 04:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
um upgrading to LED lights and doing
 
04:43:28.610 --> 04:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
things like that we're doing the best we
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
can but it you know it's it's we have
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
done some of that energy efficient stuff
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
but this this kind of came and got us
 
04:43:36.650 --> 04:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
right it wasn't something that we were
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating we do where we can like all
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
of my offices have LED lights but that's
 
04:43:44.448 --> 04:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
peas is a pretty big campus and it would
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
almost be cost prohibitive in some
 
04:43:48.530 --> 04:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
instances to replace them at this point
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
right so the cost to replace the lights
 
04:43:53.330 --> 04:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
could out at least in the short term
 
04:43:55.128 --> 04:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
outweigh what's going on and the other
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
thing to note is that you know 75
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
percent of that cost is borne by the
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
federal government as well so it's okay
 
04:44:03.288 --> 04:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
to save the federal government money I I
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
was I'm not going to argue the point
 
04:44:07.368 --> 04:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
representative I'm just saying that even
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
even to replace them would be I
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
understand but maybe when something
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
burns out yes sir we do have we do have
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
environmental staff in both places and
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
and our our Engineers are very very good
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
about keeping
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
go keeping that uh that in their minds
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
as we build new facilities I think even
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
but even more costly to us is the age of
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
the facilities representative right so
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just it's not just keeping the
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
lights on but it's generating the heat
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
as well and if the building was is 80
 
04:44:39.970 --> 04:44:39.980 align:start position:0%
years old you know in brick construction
 
04:44:42.288 --> 04:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
turn we could turn the lights off and it
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh to continue on that train of thought
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
you see the thirty thousand dollars
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
there primarily for Utilities in support
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
of the Starbase program
 
04:44:53.100 --> 04:44:54.410 align:start position:0%
of the Starbase program
uh

04:44:54.410 --> 04:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
we have a 100 federally reimbursed
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
policy now to have 24 7 on-call service
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
for some of our Engineers for uh in the
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh in the event that there's a uh an
 
04:45:05.570 --> 04:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
emergency in the uh in our facilities
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
after hours again 100 federally
 
04:45:10.490 --> 04:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursed Star based program I think I
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
said 750 000 you can see the line of
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
accounting there number four
 
04:45:15.120 --> 04:45:17.208 align:start position:0%
accounting there number four
uh

04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:20.090 --> 04:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
and uh contracts and operating Services
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
again federal funds to to uh to keep the
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
our facilities open and in addition to
 
04:45:28.610 --> 04:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
workers comp
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions really that's
 
04:45:32.090 --> 04:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
the those are the highlights for the
 
04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
changes we have from our previous
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
biennial budget and again a lot of this
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
is you know every you know the tag likes
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
to say when it comes to talk the ad in
 
04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
general likes to say you know for every
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
quarter you spend we get a dollar from
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
the federal government so it's it's it's
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
good money as long as we're not wasting
 
04:45:51.650 --> 04:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
the federal government's money and uh we
 
04:45:54.350 --> 04:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
we uh in our in our efforts to operate
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
we intend to be good stewards of uh of
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
the people's money
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
questions from representative grassy
 
04:46:05.810 --> 04:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
Griffin and McGuire basically just a
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
comment I've been over to the star-based
 
04:46:09.890 --> 04:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
facility here in Concord my son is the
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
person who's running that program good
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
good so for sergeant I know I know he
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
works right down the hall for me so I'm
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
glad that's good we haven't beat him up
 
04:46:19.250 --> 04:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
too bad yet I mean yeah he's keeping his
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
head above water it's good good
 
04:46:24.530 --> 04:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
04:46:26.890 --> 04:46:26.900 align:start position:0%
so I know
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
you need to refresh my memory because
 
04:46:34.730 --> 04:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
in in the total funds here the other
 
04:46:34.740 --> 04:46:35.930 align:start position:0%
in in the total funds here the other
funds

04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:46:37.970 --> 04:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
amount to over a hundred thousand
 
04:46:40.670 --> 04:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
dollars and you're not doing bake sales
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
or anything right no
 
04:46:45.770 --> 04:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
so here's here's how this generally
 
04:46:48.050 --> 04:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
works we so for every person that we
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
bury in the cemetery the the federal
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
government pays us a plot allowance that
 
04:46:56.830 --> 04:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
plot allowance is generally about
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
852 I think this year it's 100.
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's a CPI increase every year right
 
04:47:05.330 --> 04:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
coming back to me now so thank you so
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
that that money goes to the operational
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
cost for the cemetery and we fence it
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
off so that the cemetery can repair
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
their equipment and do those other
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
things but those other funds are
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
generally there
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
Reserve McGuire yes thank you Mr
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm looking at page 226 in
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:47:26.810 --> 04:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
which I get I think is the bottom line
 
04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
and you had quite a big lapse in um
 
04:47:32.890 --> 04:47:32.900 align:start position:0%
from 2022 to
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like right you only spent of
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
General funds 4.4 million when you're
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.330 --> 04:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
so we had two we in last in the last
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
biennium budget we had two-year money
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
added in house bill to for in support of
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
veterans social isolation and uh uh
 
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
mental health so we executed the first
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
half of that so that the remainder of
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
that lapse is part of that 1.5 million
 
04:48:05.878 --> 04:48:06.590 align:start position:0%
that lapse is part of that 1.5 million
dollars

04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
so that's but that's coming back in yeah
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
yes it absolutely is coming back in this
 
04:48:13.128 --> 04:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
year we don't want we don't want to have
 
04:48:15.730 --> 04:48:15.740 align:start position:0%
put these programs out right and then
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
not you know and then and pull the
 
04:48:21.050 --> 04:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
carpet out for the pro and the the
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
programs that we started so uh and right
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
now we have two contracts for about I
 
04:48:28.430 --> 04:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
think it's eight hundred thousand
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
dollars four hundred fifty thousand
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to Easter Seals and 350 000 to
 
04:48:36.770 --> 04:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh to the partnership for public health
 
04:48:39.050 --> 04:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
so they're they're increasing their
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to to uh
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
provide services to Veterans Mental
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
Health Services and social isolation
 
04:48:48.050 --> 04:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
services and increase networks across
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
the state so that that's the first part
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
of that money has been spent we have
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
another year on that on that that's not
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
a difference of millions right that's it
 
04:48:58.260 --> 04:48:59.390 align:start position:0%
a difference of millions right that's it
so

04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
here's what I'm looking at so first of
 
04:49:01.740 --> 04:49:03.050 align:start position:0%
here's what I'm looking at so first of
all

04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
according to this you got
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
um close to 20 million of federal funds
 
04:49:12.530 --> 04:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
in 2022 but for this year and and the
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
subsequent years you're expecting more
 
04:49:18.230 --> 04:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
like 33. so that's like a 50 increase or
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
something like that it's very big
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so that's what I asked you so
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing that happened at the end
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
of covid right was the Federal
 
04:49:28.368 --> 04:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
Government waived their Federal match
 
04:49:33.770 --> 04:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
the state match uh okay so so the the it
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't like we didn't spend money we
 
04:49:36.890 --> 04:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
just didn't spend general fund money
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
nice so and then so that money is going
 
04:49:40.970 --> 04:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay one other thing so I'm I'm a former
 
04:49:46.250 --> 04:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
member of division three
 
04:49:49.250 --> 04:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that always surprised
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
me was that the Veterans Home is all
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
General funds yes it can you explain why
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
or so veteran fund the vet I I don't
 
04:50:00.170 --> 04:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the commandant of the
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
veterans home so I'll have that caveat
 
04:50:04.128 --> 04:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
first the veterans who had all kinds of
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
veteran services but but the Veterans
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
Home is not part of the Department of
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
and generally when I get asked that
 
04:50:13.610 --> 04:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
question I answer it this way the
 
04:50:16.250 --> 04:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home is a nursing home that
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
houses veterans not a veterans home that
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a nursing home so we have no
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
expertise in the department on running a
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
nursing home so it's not part of of what
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
it is that we do here so I uh I mean
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's the best answer I can give you uh
 
04:50:34.730 --> 04:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
I don't again I can't speak for her
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
budget but so I know they get some they
 
04:50:40.128 --> 04:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
get support from the VA and I know and I
 
04:50:42.288 --> 04:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
know some of the
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of the cost is borne by the
 
04:50:46.930 --> 04:50:46.940 align:start position:0%
residents through their VA compensation
 
04:50:50.330 --> 04:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
but beyond that sir I I'm reluctant to
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question do you have any
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
idea what other states do along those
 
04:50:53.878 --> 04:50:54.850 align:start position:0%
idea what other states do along those
lines

04:50:54.850 --> 04:50:54.860 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:50:57.890 --> 04:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh it's not something I've looked into I
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
really pay more attention to the the VA
 
04:51:03.050 --> 04:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
compensation and claim pieces in terms
 
04:51:06.410 --> 04:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
of other states uh and the cemeteries in
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
terms of other states because I and then
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
I try to stay I mean I have enough to do
 
04:51:12.530 --> 04:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
frankly without having to do the veteran
 
04:51:14.570 --> 04:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
home piece too I would imagine that it's
 
04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
a mix across the country if I was if you
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
had put a gun to my head and made me
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
answer the question I would say some
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
states roll it all up into their
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Services and some
 
04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
states keep it separate we're unique and
 
04:51:29.448 --> 04:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
not unique but uh in this state we have
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
those veteran services co-located with
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
the National Guard other states have
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
them co-located with the National Guard
 
04:51:37.550 --> 04:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
and in addition have Emergency
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
Management so director Buxton would be
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
part of the adjunate generals piece and
 
04:51:46.850 --> 04:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
they call them super tags uh but uh I
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
would say some probably have it done
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
that way and then they're separate from
 
04:51:51.770 --> 04:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
the National Guard it's a separate a
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
separate piece yeah I'm just thinking
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
that because you get you know three to
 
04:52:01.128 --> 04:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
one four to one federal funds they get
 
04:52:04.250 --> 04:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
zero you know so somehow if it was moved
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
into your area you know you know
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
in that light I would say the funding
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
sources wouldn't change for the veterans
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
home if they were us the federal money
 
04:52:18.650 --> 04:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
that we get in support of it all of it
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
is in support of the National Guard none
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
of it is in support of federal Services
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay so all of our veteran services are
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
100 generally funded except for the
 
04:52:29.570 --> 04:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
income that comes from plot allowance
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
from the VA and that would be the same
 
04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
as rent for the residents of the the the
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
the better I think so if you ask the
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
question that way is this not going to
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
change and we can't and frankly and to
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
be uh just to put another point of
 
04:52:48.410 --> 04:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
clarification and precision on it
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
the the way the federal government
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
controls that spending is not by a
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
grants officer that's at the Department
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
of Transportation in Washington D.C we
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a United States fiscal and property
 
04:53:00.770 --> 04:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
officer who sits on our who's a federal
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
employee sits on our uh our compound
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
he's substantially involved and make to
 
04:53:08.330 --> 04:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that the money that we spend
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
is allocatable and uh and appropriate to
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we do and we to the penny it's it's
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
what drives Miss Chen crazy because he
 
04:53:19.128 --> 04:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
is right in our Hip Pocket every day so
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
if we tried to spend it wrong we'd
 
04:53:20.760 --> 04:53:21.590 align:start position:0%
if we tried to spend it wrong we'd
catches

04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
catches
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative cambrells thank you
 
04:53:26.690 --> 04:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I'm sorry if I missed
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
something along the way but
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and the total number of positions at
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
the very end you're going down from 163
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
to 128. could you talk to that and then
 
04:53:40.128 --> 04:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
also uh the overall expenditure amount
 
04:53:42.410 --> 04:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
budget it doesn't go down by very much
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah you're going down by a
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
significant number of positions could
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
you explain that so the number of
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
positions are the firefighters that I
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
referenced in the piece those those
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Federal firefighters so that's that's it
 
04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
uh 30 35 of the firefighters are being
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
abolished and then uh
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
so that's it and they were so
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that's those were the numbers they
 
04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
said so okay so and and then uh this
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know part of part of the there's no
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
general fund decrease because they're
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
100 Federal reimbursed
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
and deserves so Melissa Mr hopping those
 
04:54:20.570 --> 04:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
are the house bill wine abolishments we
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
saw talked about earlier
 
04:54:25.550 --> 04:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't have to double check but that's
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
what they were that's where they would
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
appear when they're removed from the
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
state system would be in house bill one
 
04:54:33.288 --> 04:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
back in budget
 
04:54:36.530 --> 04:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.530 --> 04:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
question from representative evil so I
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
was curious about the veterans cemetery
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
do you have plenty of room there yes yes
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am so we have enough undeveloped
 
04:54:49.128 --> 04:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
acreage to take us effectively to about
 
04:54:49.138 --> 04:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
acreage to take us effectively to about
2095

04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
so so I think it won't be full before
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
well certainly won't be full before I
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
need it
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
well we're all in the same bracket
 
04:55:03.770 --> 04:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
except for the youngster over here to my
 
04:55:03.780 --> 04:55:05.868 align:start position:0%
except for the youngster over here to my
left

04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
so we have we have plenty of space in
 
04:55:09.530 --> 04:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
fact we're we're on the phone with the
 
04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
we had a conference call with the VA
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
about the next expansion uh attendance
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Cemetery job to develop the next acreage
 
04:55:18.650 --> 04:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
and generally we have we keep on we keep
 
04:55:21.890 --> 04:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
on developed space enough
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years is the goal so the VA
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
will fund the next expansion of the
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
cemetery to get us to capacity of 10
 
04:55:31.330 --> 04:55:31.340 align:start position:0%
years and if you're interested in the
 
04:55:33.650 --> 04:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
projections we're bearing up somewhere
 
04:55:35.330 --> 04:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
between in the last three years
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
somewhere between a thousand and 1200
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
veterans a year and their and their
 
04:55:40.850 --> 04:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
families it's not all veterans sometimes
 
04:55:43.368 --> 04:55:43.378 align:start position:0%
it's eligible dependents probably about
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
800 plots are taken up every year uh so
 
04:55:50.448 --> 04:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
that's that's about where we are
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you sir thank you
 
04:55:55.550 --> 04:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
other well one more question
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
Almost Got Away yeah
 
04:55:58.680 --> 04:55:59.810 align:start position:0%
Almost Got Away yeah
so

04:55:59.810 --> 04:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
are any um New Hampshire
 
04:56:06.610 --> 04:56:06.620 align:start position:0%
a National Guard in Poland or
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
starting so there were there were some
 
04:56:12.170 --> 04:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
in Europe yeah uh there there are
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
currently I can get you the exact number
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
so I could send you that current to
 
04:56:18.050 --> 04:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
current state of where we deploy as a
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I just forwarded to the
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
governor's office this morning this is a
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
normal report I'll be sure to send it to
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee if you're
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
interested I don't believe anybody's in
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
Europe right now I don't believe
 
04:56:30.770 --> 04:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
anybody's in Europe uh most of the
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
people are either coming back from the
 
04:56:36.288 --> 04:56:36.298 align:start position:0%
Middle East or getting ready to go to
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
the Middle East mostly those folks are
 
04:56:40.970 --> 04:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
artillery men uh they do targeting and
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
some other missions uh in the Middle
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
East and then we have a contingent as I
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier on the Southwest
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
border in Texas
 
04:56:51.288 --> 04:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
but I'll get you I'll get you the little
 
04:56:52.670 --> 04:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
sheet unclassified sheet of where
 
04:56:54.890 --> 04:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
everybody's at that's easy you shouldn't
 
04:56:56.330 --> 04:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
have asked a question because now I
 
04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
stimulated a question from me but are
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
all the deployments federally paid for
 
04:57:04.368 --> 04:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
it's a rule or yes as a as a rule
 
04:57:06.288 --> 04:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
deployments in support of the nation's
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
missions are federally paid for so the
 
04:57:10.850 --> 04:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
folks that are and not as a rule that's
 
04:57:12.530 --> 04:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
the way it is right that's absolutely
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
the way it is so without getting too
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
deep into it we generally have statuses
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
we have a state status federally funded
 
04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
we have a federal status federally
 
04:57:22.138 --> 04:57:23.570 align:start position:0%
we have a federal status federally
funded

04:57:23.570 --> 04:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
and we have a state status state funded
 
04:57:27.890 --> 04:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
so the folks that are going to
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh here in the next week are
 
04:57:33.050 --> 04:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
estate status ordered by the governor
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
state funded so those folks that are
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to work in in support of
 
04:57:38.570 --> 04:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks and her folks over
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
there are that state active duty we call
 
04:57:41.340 --> 04:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
there are that state active duty we call
it

04:57:42.410 --> 04:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
during covid we had two statuses we had
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
State active duty state funded and we
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
had title 32 status under the control of
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
the governor but federally funded and
 
04:57:54.410 --> 04:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
that was generally under the guise of
 
04:57:56.330 --> 04:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
FEMA and FEMA's response to the National
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
Emergency and we go if you're going on a
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
contingency operation you're on the
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
border you're out in you know Europe for
 
04:58:05.570 --> 04:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
example or you're going to the Middle
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
East that's the president's doing and
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
the president pays
 
04:58:12.128 --> 04:58:12.138 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
you guys are awesome because I don't
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
have to go back to work the more you ask
 
04:58:15.718 --> 04:58:20.270 align:start position:0%
have to go back to work the more you ask
questions

04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
have any of the equipment that we've
 
04:58:26.810 --> 04:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
provided to Ukraine depleted your
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
supplies no nothing like that okay so
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
and and uh interestingly enough
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
generally on the federal deployments now
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
because the theaters are mature right
 
04:58:39.230 --> 04:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not projecting a force
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
we're just rotating forces through the
 
04:58:43.970 --> 04:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
equipment is there so we don't you know
 
04:58:46.250 --> 04:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
our equipment stays here to to train and
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
do some things it's it is not
 
04:58:49.680 --> 04:58:50.990 align:start position:0%
do some things it's it is not
uh

04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:53.330 --> 04:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
It's Not Unusual for our airplanes to be
 
04:58:55.550 --> 04:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
in support of those missions right so
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
the kc-46 refueler Pegasus refueler that
 
04:59:01.250 --> 04:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
we just you know we just uh implemented
 
04:59:03.288 --> 04:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
at peace those those planes are flying
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
real world missions all the time whether
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
in Pacific at Guam whether they're in
 
04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
Europe you know pulling fighter aircraft
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
or other aircraft to the theater of
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
operations we're doing that flying the
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
bridge across the North Atlantic to make
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
sure people have enough you know Jets
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
have enough fuel to get across those
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
folks are absolute instruments of war
 
04:59:23.330 --> 04:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
that we're using you know every day are
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
we leaving our equipment to go to
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
Ukraine taking our stuff away to go to
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
Ukraine the answer is no sir
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thanks
 
04:59:34.250 --> 04:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time yeah all
 
04:59:34.260 --> 04:59:35.890 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time yeah all
right

04:59:35.890 --> 04:59:35.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:59:37.970 --> 04:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
well I actually have a question I don't
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
know if this applies to you folks or not
 
04:59:42.650 --> 04:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
but my understanding was that peas they
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
built something like a 12 million dollar
 
04:59:47.810 --> 04:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
facility to take care of pfas is that
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
you or is that the people that would be
 
04:59:51.890 --> 04:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
the PDA yes outside so certainly keep it
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
from worked out that's okay so certainly
 
04:59:55.970 --> 04:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
the certainly we have an interest in the
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
the issues with the water contamination
 
04:59:59.868 --> 04:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
at Peas the division of Veterans
 
05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
Services has created a registry for
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to register in case
 
05:00:06.410 --> 05:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
the VA declares a presumption so you may
 
05:00:08.090 --> 05:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
have heard of Camp Lejeune all of those
 
05:00:10.250 --> 05:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
other things those presumptions of the
 
05:00:12.288 --> 05:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
water contamination and if you get a
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
condition listed under those
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
presumptions then you automatically are
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for VA compensation
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
they haven't done that for peas or any
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
other place when they do we have people
 
05:00:24.530 --> 05:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
a list of names that we periodically
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
update so that we can reach out to them
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
but we are not doing anything to clean
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
water up at uh at I know the Air Force
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
has been and I believe the Big Air Force
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
the regular Air Force is not interested
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
in getting involved yet
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's but that's not that's outside of
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
my pay grade
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
there we go again thank you thank you
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.600 --> 05:00:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
great

05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.680 --> 05:00:54.730 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:00:54.730 --> 05:00:54.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so you everybody okay with this
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
well once we get through the budget
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.990 --> 05:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
do you folks wanna
 
05:01:39.530 --> 05:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
continue for just a little while or come
 
05:01:42.170 --> 05:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
back Monday morning it's up to you I
 
05:01:44.690 --> 05:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
know Mr Hoffman and Melissa would love
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to have a few more things to check off
 
05:01:48.890 --> 05:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the so they can keep themselves here
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.448 --> 05:02:04.458 align:start position:0%
let's see what's 132.
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is suspended okay approved section
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:02:25.550 --> 05:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with that show our hands
 
05:02:25.560 --> 05:02:27.050 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with that show our hands
okay

05:02:27.050 --> 05:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know representative McGuire he has a
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
little list he gives me every day here
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
but he has fallen behind as far as what
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
um some reason I have a question mark on
 
05:02:43.320 --> 05:02:51.170 align:start position:0%
um some reason I have a question mark on
138.

05:02:51.170 --> 05:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that was I wasn't here for
 
05:02:59.050 --> 05:02:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
he did everything else
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah because it was an open-ended
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.090 --> 05:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.810 --> 05:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
so the deputies of the commissioner
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
I guess we'd have to look at RSA what
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
is this a common thing that's just in
 
05:03:48.530 --> 05:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.128 --> 05:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
the energy in the puc can generate money
 
05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
from assessments
 
05:03:57.890 --> 05:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not that common because
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
the number of fiscal committee approvals
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
isn't that broad but
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
what this language would do would allow
 
05:04:07.788 --> 05:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
them to
 
05:04:10.128 --> 05:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
seek fiscal committee
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
to pay things by increasing the
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
so I need
 
05:04:18.900 --> 05:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
so I need
thoughts

05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is saying might
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
so 38
 
05:04:34.020 --> 05:04:34.628 align:start position:0%
so 38
.

05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
.
 
05:04:37.490 --> 05:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
so did you take care of all the public
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
it's your consumer Advocate Mr chair I
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
don't think we had House Bill 2 when
 
05:04:51.708 --> 05:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
they came in before the department of
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
energy when they came in okay
 
05:04:54.840 --> 05:04:58.010 align:start position:0%
energy when they came in okay
okay

05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
was that something we should get the
 
05:05:02.448 --> 05:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
Department of energy back in here or do
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
you think we can answer these questions
 
05:05:03.958 --> 05:05:06.948 align:start position:0%
you think we can answer these questions
ourselves

05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have a little time yeah did they go
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
through their budget or did they just do
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
their overview
 
05:05:21.490 --> 05:05:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
we maybe just didn't get to this one
 
05:05:29.570 --> 05:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
right I don't remember going but they
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
asked for this extra person
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't that thrilled with it
 
05:05:34.200 --> 05:05:34.788 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't that thrilled with it
um

05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so they asked for this extra
 
05:05:37.080 --> 05:05:38.570 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so they asked for this extra
person

05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:05:40.490 --> 05:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
um that I guess you see I hear on line
 
05:05:44.330 --> 05:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
five of page 49. and
 
05:05:44.340 --> 05:05:45.890 align:start position:0%
five of page 49. and
um

05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:48.650 --> 05:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem that that urgence I mean
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
it was like
 
05:05:52.128 --> 05:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
to attend meetings or something you know
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
what I mean it wasn't
 
05:05:53.580 --> 05:05:54.830 align:start position:0%
what I mean it wasn't
um

05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.730 --> 05:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
well yeah because anything in the house
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill too is is in the budget right but
 
05:06:04.920 --> 05:06:05.868 align:start position:0%
bill too is is in the budget right but
um

05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know it didn't seem that
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
line five of page 49 in house bill 2.
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
three additional staff people not
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're not looking at House Bill 2
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.090 --> 05:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.208 --> 05:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
so Mr Hoffman went what's the impact to
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
that I know you
 
05:06:54.650 --> 05:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:56.270 --> 05:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
position is included in the house bill
 
05:06:59.400 --> 05:07:08.570 align:start position:0%
position is included in the house bill
one

05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
right it's it's included but in my mind
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
he didn't make a good enough a very good
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:21.410 --> 05:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
if I remember right
 
05:07:23.810 --> 05:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
he wanted that position to represent New
 
05:07:25.330 --> 05:07:25.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:34.610 --> 05:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
is that like is that a full-time
 
05:07:40.970 --> 05:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:42.530 --> 05:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire do you want to
 
05:07:44.690 --> 05:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
have him come back in or since now we
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
have no spill two which apparently we
 
05:07:49.490 --> 05:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
did not have when energies all right
 
05:07:49.500 --> 05:07:52.190 align:start position:0%
did not have when energies all right
yeah

05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:54.650 --> 05:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman maybe we could get
 
05:07:55.970 --> 05:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
them in
 
05:08:01.810 --> 05:08:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.230 --> 05:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and speaking of Monday where we
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
have just it's in the calendar it's a
 
05:08:13.010 --> 05:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
work session but I've asked the
 
05:08:14.690 --> 05:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
that come in and I think it's nine
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
o'clock Melissa for 9 30 rather um I
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
told them 9 30 but I just sent them an
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
email to change it because I think we're
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
doing a retirement bill at 9 30 now on
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
Monday morning so
 
05:08:30.770 --> 05:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
I switched them to 10 o'clock maybe you
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
can squeeze in the department of energy
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the morning there Jeff
 
05:08:38.690 --> 05:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
so I thought it might be important to
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
have Das come in because of the employee
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
pay raise issue that we discussed the
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.320 --> 05:08:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:08:53.810 --> 05:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:08:56.208 --> 05:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
um so next represent employee pay raise
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:09:01.010 --> 05:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
but I thought that's a no choice thing
 
05:09:10.330 --> 05:09:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.730 --> 05:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
well we can separate those in Union
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
employees out the classified and
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
non-classified oh I see you see what the
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
impact is
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
this and Das needs some time and they'd
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:30.170 --> 05:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
so I see you looking at the
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is looking at the
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill sheet which we're pretty close to
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
getting done with
 
05:09:39.600 --> 05:09:42.110 align:start position:0%
getting done with
um

05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.050 --> 05:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
so the residential eviction proceedings
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
do we make it that far that was
 
05:09:50.830 --> 05:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:09:54.288 --> 05:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
379. Let's flip it back
 
05:09:59.208 --> 05:09:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:02.810 --> 05:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm sorry that uh
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
we actually did act I should have looked
 
05:10:06.410 --> 05:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
at this sheet that was moved by
 
05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.090 --> 05:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.890 --> 05:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay I've got the right list in front of
 
05:10:19.970 --> 05:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
me so the next bill that we had was 336
 
05:10:24.770 --> 05:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
which we discussed today I'm sorry 436.
 
05:10:27.050 --> 05:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
which Weaver as you all know asked for
 
05:10:29.410 --> 05:10:29.420 align:start position:0%
more information oh here's a good one
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
that see a solid waste management fund
 
05:10:39.410 --> 05:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
that we've heard so much about from
 
05:10:41.690 --> 05:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
a two million dollar ask
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we have not acted on that I jumped
 
05:10:52.730 --> 05:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
now would they be ready for this money
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.090 --> 05:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes well I mean they have to uh they
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
have to sort of do the Outreach and set
 
05:11:06.770 --> 05:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
up the program but yes they're ready for
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
it and the fund was established
 
05:11:12.530 --> 05:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago the fund was
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
established a couple of years ago in
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
anticipation of EPA funding which as I
 
05:11:21.770 --> 05:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
explained before the guidelines do not
 
05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
permit the state to apply for Grants so
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're pretty much ready and they're
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
very excited at the prospect of getting
 
05:11:32.690 --> 05:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
this going especially now that we have
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management plan in place
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the goals of the solid waste
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
management plan was to
 
05:11:44.690 --> 05:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
get some uh funding uh you know to try
 
05:11:47.090 --> 05:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
to move ahead on our plan to decrease
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
landfill usage Etc the other part of
 
05:11:54.288 --> 05:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
this bill you may recall is that um we
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
were changing slightly the focus of the
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
bill to Target
 
05:12:02.690 --> 05:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
um composting infrastructure development
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
and it works hand in hand with HB 300
 
05:12:09.770 --> 05:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
which we have decided to include in the
 
05:12:09.780 --> 05:12:12.050 align:start position:0%
which we have decided to include in the
budget

05:12:12.050 --> 05:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I you know I would strongly urge the
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
division to recommend the inclusion of
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
this we haven't done much of anything on
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste for decades and we're being
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
left in the Dust by all our other states
 
05:12:32.930 --> 05:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that continues to
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
from the song
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the soft working group we took a vote to
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
they authorized me to write to the
 
05:12:52.970 --> 05:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
division in support of this bill and the
 
05:12:52.980 --> 05:12:56.170 align:start position:0%
division in support of this bill and the
appropriation

05:12:56.170 --> 05:12:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.180 --> 05:12:58.128 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
so the point is that I should put it in
 
05:13:04.128 --> 05:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 then or or do we pass it
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
because it's 2023 number
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
I thought we could just roll it into the
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
budget okay
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I just would I'd also say that this
 
05:13:15.360 --> 05:13:16.430 align:start position:0%
and I just would I'd also say that this
was

05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:13:20.448 --> 05:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
um unanimously recommended from uh Ena
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it passed pretty unanimously pretty
 
05:13:27.170 --> 05:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
much I was listening uh on a Voice vote
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
out of the house so if we're looking at
 
05:13:32.090 --> 05:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
it from the policy standpoint it's had
 
05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know thumbs up all the way okay
 
05:13:36.890 --> 05:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
well if you want to move it I will
 
05:13:39.650 --> 05:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
second it okay I'd like to move
 
05:13:41.530 --> 05:13:41.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to make a comment
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
would you settle for a million if we uh
 
05:13:47.570 --> 05:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
if we run into difficulties here
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
um well I'm gonna hang tough it too and
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
hope that uh hope that I mean you want
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
to have enough so that you can use the
 
05:13:58.368 --> 05:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
money to help support the infrastructure
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to the department about
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
it and the 2 million would be really a
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
good way of of kick-starting this and
 
05:14:09.770 --> 05:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
um you know the hope is that this will
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
get the management the solid waste
 
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
management fund going and then they're
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
going to be going for more Grant monies
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to find alternative ways to
 
05:14:22.490 --> 05:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
um to support the fund and the only
 
05:14:24.770 --> 05:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
other thing I'll say is that in the
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
research that I've done with my study
 
05:14:26.760 --> 05:14:27.708 align:start position:0%
research that I've done with my study
committee

05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
virtually all states have a solid waste
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
management fund and to support efforts
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the state and we don't
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
again where I'm coming from is I'm one
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
of the I believe it's a great
 
05:14:44.090 --> 05:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity for entrepreneurs and I
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe in the theory of build it and
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
they shall come so I'm not as opposed to
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
having a fund to kind of seed money to
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
kind of trigger some of these thoughts
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's up to the
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs to to invest in advance
 
05:14:59.930 --> 05:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
and then and then it will come if you
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
build it the garbage will come trust me
 
05:15:04.128 --> 05:15:04.138 align:start position:0%
well the other thing is to help
 
05:15:06.410 --> 05:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are trying to get
 
05:15:08.810 --> 05:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
their composting programs going it's
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
targeted for 50 percent for um food
 
05:15:14.448 --> 05:15:14.458 align:start position:0%
waste diversion and you'll recall from
 
05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
our discussions before that our
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
landfills 25 or more of what's going
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
into them is food waste and what we
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
really are trying to do to get our um
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
to get our landfills to have less stuff
 
05:15:30.410 --> 05:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
in them is to get the food waste out
 
05:15:33.890 --> 05:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
like we did with um like we did with the
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
leaf and yard waste many years ago and
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
this is just like this really obvious
 
05:15:42.170 --> 05:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%

05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
05:16:26.940 --> 05:16:28.190 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin

05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative Campbells no
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes representative
 
05:16:45.368 --> 05:16:45.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven to one
 
05:16:53.090 --> 05:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
all right that being seven to one
 
05:16:53.100 --> 05:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
all right that being seven to one
um

05:16:53.830 --> 05:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa there's something else
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
oh yeah sure represent Canberra is a
 
05:17:05.570 --> 05:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
minority Port required or no no not
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
required thank you and not even
 
05:17:07.200 --> 05:17:10.730 align:start position:0%
required thank you and not even
encouraged

05:17:10.730 --> 05:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.890 --> 05:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
well and this is not the final book no
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah this so this will be recommended to
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee when we meet
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
right but previously we we've also had
 
05:17:23.570 --> 05:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
to do reports even though it's going to
 
05:17:25.610 --> 05:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
the next full committee so I just wanted
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be sure I didn't have any
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility oh no no no no no no no
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
not whatsoever and generally that
 
05:17:35.090 --> 05:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
um because you never know that there may
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
be a bill that we recommend to the full
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee that represent Maguire will
 
05:17:42.530 --> 05:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
speak to for instance and committee May
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
decides a terrible thing so instead of
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
writing a majority report you'll have to
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
write a Minority Report but usually it
 
05:17:53.090 --> 05:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
so what else we have um
 
05:17:59.230 --> 05:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
so we've acted on
 
05:18:02.810 --> 05:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
the adult parole board that was ought to
 
05:18:02.820 --> 05:18:05.570 align:start position:0%
the adult parole board that was ought to
pass

05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sure representative Sweeney so on
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
504 we we had heard this last Friday
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
made a reasonable pitch and we talked
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
about it as a group and we supported it
 
05:18:20.690 --> 05:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
then on Monday they came in and with a
 
05:18:22.970 --> 05:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
on the budget presentation they asked
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
for another 86 000 to fund a new staff
 
05:18:28.730 --> 05:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
position that they didn't reference the
 
05:18:31.490 --> 05:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
need or want on Friday so I don't know
 
05:18:35.208 --> 05:18:35.218 align:start position:0%
if we can go back to 504 just to talk
 
05:18:37.850 --> 05:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
about in kind of weigh The Adult Parole
 
05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
Board stipend increases that they
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
requested in 504 with their budgets 86
 
05:18:46.440 --> 05:18:47.448 align:start position:0%
requested in 504 with their budgets 86
000.

05:18:47.448 --> 05:18:47.458 align:start position:0%
000.
 
05:18:50.330 --> 05:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
for a new full-time staff position to
 
05:18:53.208 --> 05:18:53.218 align:start position:0%
support the board and in my head I know
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
there's it's 30 000 more for the new
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
staffer but I think it would make more
 
05:19:01.010 --> 05:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
sense to use the money on a staff
 
05:19:04.128 --> 05:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
support position than increasing the
 
05:19:08.208 --> 05:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
stipends by a hundred percent for the
 
05:19:10.128 --> 05:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
parole board members
 
05:19:10.138 --> 05:19:11.208 align:start position:0%
parole board members
um

05:19:11.208 --> 05:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
so I I guess if we can have the
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
conversation about what we view as more
 
05:19:15.060 --> 05:19:16.368 align:start position:0%
conversation about what we view as more
important

05:19:16.368 --> 05:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman
 
05:19:23.400 --> 05:19:24.470 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman
um

05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
how does this factor in we've got their
 
05:19:30.180 --> 05:19:32.448 align:start position:0%
how does this factor in we've got their
request

05:19:32.448 --> 05:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 504 is their conflict
 
05:19:40.128 --> 05:19:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.530 --> 05:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no there's no conflict
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
they're just two different additions to
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
the parole board
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative so in my mind I was the
 
05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
other way around in the sense that I
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
didn't think they really Justified the
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
extra staff person but but this is for
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
people that are having trouble finding
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
right especially the um
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
well the former member you know bringing
 
05:20:08.810 --> 05:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
back a former member thing
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
um because they they want to meet on a
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
regular basis and and sometimes people
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
aren't available and they're also having
 
05:20:15.900 --> 05:20:17.570 align:start position:0%
aren't available and they're also having
trouble

05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
um getting someone appointed to the
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
board right so uh that was my motivation
 
05:20:26.208 --> 05:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
for supporting
 
05:20:29.930 --> 05:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504 because
 
05:20:29.940 --> 05:20:30.530 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504 because
um

05:20:30.530 --> 05:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
these are very experienced people and so
 
05:20:36.410 --> 05:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
you're trying to sort of call call back
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
people from retirement right to to do
 
05:20:41.930 --> 05:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
this work and it's it's there's a lot of
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
work and it's stressful and so on and
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's why and it's not cheap right
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
these are people that are normally paid
 
05:20:50.690 --> 05:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
a lot of money so um
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
so representative Hewitt you made the
 
05:20:55.310 --> 05:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
motion a lot to pass and there was
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
obviously some dissent because it was
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
seven to two I don't know if you want to
 
05:21:01.490 --> 05:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
speak to it or
 
05:21:04.490 --> 05:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
well the the what was going on here
 
05:21:07.010 --> 05:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
attorney Phillips was talking about was
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
there are I think there are three three
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
people at some of the time
 
05:21:13.200 --> 05:21:14.708 align:start position:0%
people at some of the time
and

05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
they sit quite a lot
 
05:21:20.090 --> 05:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that there when
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
somebody they don't have a back
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I have a backstop they just have the
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
parole a probe on them so they don't
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
have any means of bringing back
 
05:21:30.840 --> 05:21:31.490 align:start position:0%
have any means of bringing back
um

05:21:31.490 --> 05:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:31.500 --> 05:21:33.010 align:start position:0%
um
former

05:21:33.010 --> 05:21:33.020 align:start position:0%
former
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
retired according authors
 
05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
so they wind up having having delays
 
05:21:38.820 --> 05:21:40.010 align:start position:0%
so they wind up having having delays
having

05:21:40.010 --> 05:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:21:42.650 --> 05:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
pushing things out
 
05:21:45.410 --> 05:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
double booking things like that and this
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
was this would prevent them to bring
 
05:21:52.250 --> 05:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
back a uh a retired
 
05:21:55.250 --> 05:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
Parole Board member when it's impossible
 
05:21:56.930 --> 05:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
you know somebody is sick or something
 
05:21:58.250 --> 05:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of these anyway
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's only half a dozen or less
 
05:22:04.368 --> 05:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
of members and they have to have three
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
for for rewards so that was my thought
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
05:22:13.368 --> 05:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
it's not let's let's get it done Mr
 
05:22:16.250 --> 05:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
Sheriff yes so thank you for for that
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
info so because Monday when I had asked
 
05:22:20.570 --> 05:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
about the two different requests they
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
had made one through five or four one
 
05:22:24.170 --> 05:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
through their additional budget requests
 
05:22:26.810 --> 05:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
to say what do they need more the answer
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
I remember was essentially a circular
 
05:22:31.550 --> 05:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
well I need more staff to help the world
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
board members I need the parole board
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
members to help the staff but in your
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
opinion would you say the parole board
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
actual seating sitting members would
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
should be the priority over the staff
 
05:22:45.610 --> 05:22:45.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so
 
05:22:49.368 --> 05:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
you're right they did talk about the uh
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
the necessity by having somebody on
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
occasion uh to fill in when a board is
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
being poor is being created because
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of stuff that goes
 
05:23:04.090 --> 05:23:04.100 align:start position:0%
into the uh the parole pack
 
05:23:07.128 --> 05:23:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh that has to be looked up and you know
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
carpet you know it's a bureaucracy and
 
05:23:10.860 --> 05:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
carpet you know it's a bureaucracy and
uh

05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
that of course would hold things up too
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know but it's it's getting people
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
extra people to come in when somebody is
 
05:23:20.458 --> 05:23:22.250 align:start position:0%
extra people to come in when somebody is
out

05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not additional personnel
 
05:23:27.530 --> 05:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering what excuse what
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
was the ask for the extra staff person
 
05:23:31.970 --> 05:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
it wasn't much was it
 
05:23:34.970 --> 05:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
oh it's one person it was uh with
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
benefits like 83 in the first year 87 in
 
05:23:39.770 --> 05:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
the second year and I have that as just
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
a request that hasn't been acted on yet
 
05:23:42.298 --> 05:23:45.230 align:start position:0%
a request that hasn't been acted on yet
right

05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.090 --> 05:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think the governor put it in
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
so since you don't have that we did not
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
respond to the request it's in our list
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
of things to still consider any more
 
05:24:02.030 --> 05:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Sweeney no I
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Insight from
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire representative
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
I think I'm good with with 504 and I'm
 
05:24:12.050 --> 05:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
up I think I'd be a no on the additional
 
05:24:12.060 --> 05:24:13.610 align:start position:0%
up I think I'd be a no on the additional
request

05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
we want to take up the additional
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
requests now since we're talking about
 
05:24:19.490 --> 05:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
it representative Griffin
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
do you have a view any view on the
 
05:24:23.690 --> 05:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
additional requests for staff for the
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:36.650 --> 05:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
they they said they were getting a job
 
05:24:39.288 --> 05:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
done but it was tight
 
05:24:48.170 --> 05:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.340 --> 05:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
budget

05:24:57.830 --> 05:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:01.330 --> 05:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
any more discussion representative yes
 
05:25:07.010 --> 05:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
and if you did it based on Merit they've
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm against her again additional
 
05:25:23.878 --> 05:25:26.270 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm against her again additional
requests

05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.930 --> 05:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll put it out there's a positive
 
05:25:32.810 --> 05:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
those in favor of the request hands up
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:39.840 --> 05:25:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.240 --> 05:25:46.570 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:25:46.570 --> 05:25:46.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.280 --> 05:25:58.690 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:25:58.690 --> 05:25:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:06.770 --> 05:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
the first committee was criminal justice
 
05:26:09.530 --> 05:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety and they had ought to
 
05:26:09.540 --> 05:26:10.570 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety and they had ought to
pass

05:26:10.570 --> 05:26:10.580 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:26:10.580 --> 05:26:12.110 align:start position:0%
pass
20-0

05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
20-0
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
it was a Voice vote on the floor that's
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
for 504.
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
now sounds like
 
05:26:24.590 --> 05:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like that boy should have got a
 
05:26:26.390 --> 05:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
pretty good hearing
 
05:26:26.400 --> 05:26:27.948 align:start position:0%
pretty good hearing
but

05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay so for their additional requests
 
05:26:31.330 --> 05:26:31.340 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
staff person
 
05:26:35.690 --> 05:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
those in favor of that additional
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:53.208 --> 05:26:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:56.090 --> 05:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
all right so uh what's next
 
05:26:58.970 --> 05:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
going down the list here 504 that was
 
05:27:01.128 --> 05:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
one that we held on to as a division
 
05:27:03.170 --> 05:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
that was the infamous
 
05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
tunnel in Dairy we had several work
 
05:27:08.690 --> 05:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
sessions on that
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we did vote to hold on to it the
 
05:27:14.208 --> 05:27:14.218 align:start position:0%
vote was six to two that's on our
 
05:27:16.610 --> 05:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
05:27:19.970 --> 05:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
agenda for next week but we want to up
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
the recommendation representative
 
05:27:24.650 --> 05:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
McGuire from yeah hold on to do
 
05:27:26.690 --> 05:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
something with yeah so I'm against the
 
05:27:28.850 --> 05:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
the tunnel
 
05:27:30.890 --> 05:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
um but I think
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
currently the way it's the way the bill
 
05:27:37.070 --> 05:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
is written the money is in 2024. so I
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
think the right thing to do with this
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
bill is to put the money in 2023 and
 
05:27:46.368 --> 05:27:46.378 align:start position:0%
then have a vote of the committee itl or
 
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
off to pass and send it back to the
 
05:27:51.410 --> 05:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
floor so therefore it's not part of the
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
budget it's it's you know because the
 
05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
main thing we heard from the people
 
05:28:00.650 --> 05:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
involved in the development was delay is
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
there is there problem that's right so
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
we should try to act as quickly as
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
possible and namely send it back to the
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
floor let them itl it or send it to the
 
05:28:13.850 --> 05:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
Senate and so on but I personally will
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
vote for Ito oh sure
 
05:28:21.470 --> 05:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I think I'm not sure representative
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
Hewitt made share my viewpoint on this I
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
know he's made some discussions
 
05:28:30.590 --> 05:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
to this effect but basically right as it
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
stands now they have a contract
 
05:28:36.890 --> 05:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
they have a contract with DOT
 
05:28:40.730 --> 05:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
and and the town and we're getting in
 
05:28:42.410 --> 05:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of that contract and we have
 
05:28:45.128 --> 05:28:45.138 align:start position:0%
no business being there none
 
05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
so I would I would
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know I would support emotion or
 
05:28:50.400 --> 05:28:52.850 align:start position:0%
you know I would support emotion or
ideal

05:28:52.850 --> 05:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
05:28:55.128 --> 05:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
okay what we'll do first is we'll take
 
05:28:57.890 --> 05:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
up representative McGuire's suggestion
 
05:29:01.250 --> 05:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
to move the uh 800 000 as it's listed
 
05:29:01.260 --> 05:29:02.330 align:start position:0%
to move the uh 800 000 as it's listed
here

05:29:02.330 --> 05:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:29:05.650 --> 05:29:05.660 align:start position:0%
for 2024 into
 
05:29:09.590 --> 05:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
2023 so we'll vote on that first time uh
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:16.250 --> 05:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay and now I will have a motion to
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
motion to idea so there's a motion to
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire moves can
 
05:29:27.650 --> 05:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
represents cambrell's seconds to itl
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
bingo house
 
05:29:30.718 --> 05:29:33.050 align:start position:0%
bingo house
yeah

05:29:33.050 --> 05:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:29:33.060 --> 05:29:35.208 align:start position:0%
yeah
506.

05:29:35.208 --> 05:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
506.
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
should I know it should be branded in
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
our brain yeah 506.
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
biggest file they have here other than
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
the budget everything yeah that's the
 
05:29:49.730 --> 05:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
one that damn tunnel so well I think
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're the first committee right we're
 
05:29:53.650 --> 05:29:53.660 align:start position:0%
not the second yeah
 
05:29:56.090 --> 05:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
so it could have gone so many other
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
places some other people might have seen
 
05:29:58.798 --> 05:30:03.470 align:start position:0%
places some other people might have seen
it

05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
um okay so we're basic so we're going to
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
take the motion vote on itl
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah okay all right
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yes
 
05:30:17.708 --> 05:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
05:30:19.730 --> 05:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative cambrells yes
 
05:30:25.390 --> 05:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt yes
 
05:30:29.810 --> 05:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative uh grassy yes
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk votes yes representative
 
05:30:34.490 --> 05:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
leishman yes
 
05:30:37.490 --> 05:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay here we go one two three four five
 
05:30:42.770 --> 05:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
six seven eight eight zero motion to itl
 
05:30:45.490 --> 05:30:45.500 align:start position:0%
all right so representative
 
05:30:51.530 --> 05:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.890 --> 05:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah this has to be a real
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.750 --> 05:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
so the other the only other one that we
 
05:31:01.970 --> 05:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
have which we've had a work session on
 
05:31:04.610 --> 05:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
is 571
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
that you may recalls about 84 million
 
05:31:10.730 --> 05:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
dollar group too yeah do that at the end
 
05:31:16.270 --> 05:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.830 --> 05:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
I know you have some suggestions yes I
 
05:31:18.840 --> 05:31:19.788 align:start position:0%
I know you have some suggestions yes I
do

05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:31:21.530 --> 05:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
this was a very I think this was a
 
05:31:25.930 --> 05:31:25.940 align:start position:0%
relatively close both right
 
05:31:29.810 --> 05:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
40 vote difference or something
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
192 to 167.
 
05:31:35.760 --> 05:31:36.890 align:start position:0%
192 to 167.
so

05:31:36.890 --> 05:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:40.730 --> 05:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
less than less than 30 both okay so
 
05:31:40.740 --> 05:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
less than less than 30 both okay so
um

05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.850 --> 05:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
this is a very this is a bill that has a
 
05:31:48.288 --> 05:31:48.298 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
05:31:51.530 --> 05:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
um flexibility in the sense that it's
 
05:31:54.050 --> 05:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
just an extra benefit for a certain
 
05:31:58.250 --> 05:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
class of employees and so
 
05:31:58.260 --> 05:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
class of employees and so
um

05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
but the reason it's such a big number is
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
because it's really a very honest bill
 
05:32:07.610 --> 05:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it's giving this extra
 
05:32:07.620 --> 05:32:08.590 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it's giving this extra
benefit

05:32:08.590 --> 05:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
permanently to this class to this
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
particular group of employees so it's
 
05:32:15.650 --> 05:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's going to be this year and the next
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
year and the next year and the next year
 
05:32:20.930 --> 05:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
so the 84 million is the amount that
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
that if we did if we just passed the
 
05:32:25.730 --> 05:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
benefit without any money that would be
 
05:32:27.770 --> 05:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
the amount the unfunded liability would
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
increase right so this is to cover the
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the the the the permanent nature of
 
05:32:37.910 --> 05:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
this of this benefit okay and so
 
05:32:40.368 --> 05:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
um what's commonly done according to
 
05:32:42.730 --> 05:32:42.740 align:start position:0%
Carol this with these colas is
 
05:32:45.708 --> 05:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
that they're not made permanent they're
 
05:32:47.448 --> 05:32:47.458 align:start position:0%
they're made one time
 
05:32:50.930 --> 05:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh this group or or a good
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
part of this group got a cola in the
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
last budget
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
so uh but again as a one-time thing not
 
05:33:02.090 --> 05:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
as a permanent thing and so
 
05:33:05.208 --> 05:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
one way to cut this down from from 80
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
million plus to something smaller and
 
05:33:11.390 --> 05:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
considerably smaller like 8 million or
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
something or ten would be to again go
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
one time with this with this benefit
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
rather than permanent
 
05:33:22.128 --> 05:33:22.138 align:start position:0%
or it could simply be you say well you
 
05:33:25.368 --> 05:33:25.378 align:start position:0%
got a cola last year maybe no cola this
 
05:33:27.530 --> 05:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
year right so you know there's all kinds
 
05:33:29.628 --> 05:33:29.638 align:start position:0%
of ways to do it we did get a piece of
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
paper that showed
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um back in the days when the stock
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
market was zooming they were giving you
 
05:33:38.990 --> 05:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
know one percent two percent colas every
 
05:33:39.000 --> 05:33:40.550 align:start position:0%
know one percent two percent colas every
year

05:33:40.550 --> 05:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:33:42.170 --> 05:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
um but then since then there's been
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
hardly any colas
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and this one is a five percent Cola
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
for a certain group a 10 for another
 
05:33:54.890 --> 05:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
and so on but but you know you could
 
05:33:57.050 --> 05:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
change the details of what the group is
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
you could change the details of what the
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
cola applies to I personally dislike the
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written in the sense
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
that it steps right this group of people
 
05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
gets five percent that group of people
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
gets 10 percent lots of other groups of
 
05:34:16.368 --> 05:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
people don't get anything right and so
 
05:34:18.650 --> 05:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
you could more you could smooth those
 
05:34:21.170 --> 05:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
steps and make it more of a ramp
 
05:34:21.180 --> 05:34:21.970 align:start position:0%
steps and make it more of a ramp
um

05:34:21.970 --> 05:34:21.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to to fund this so there's
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
lots of ways to change it
 
05:34:30.530 --> 05:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know
 
05:34:30.540 --> 05:34:31.788 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know
um

05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
anyways others can talk yeah yeah
 
05:34:37.190 --> 05:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney I'm sorry Mr
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
chairman oh sorry Melissa oh you go
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
before all the rest of us sorry I just
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to jump in real quick to let you
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
guys know that Janet's scheduled a work
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
session on this bill for 9 30 on Monday
 
05:34:51.050 --> 05:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
morning if that impacts your thoughts I
 
05:34:52.910 --> 05:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
must have forgotten it just came out
 
05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:56.280 --> 05:34:58.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:34:58.330 --> 05:34:58.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
no she mentioned that Janet that
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
anything was left that we really didn't
 
05:35:04.250 --> 05:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
act up while we had to get schedules I
 
05:35:06.530 --> 05:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
guess I did jump the gun yes represents
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
Sweeney speaking to that earlier today I
 
05:35:10.730 --> 05:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
spoke out of turn one of the
 
05:35:12.410 --> 05:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
representatives I believe from either
 
05:35:15.288 --> 05:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
fire or police once we were done talking
 
05:35:18.770 --> 05:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
about 436 ask me just while we weren't
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
in session if we were taking up any
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
other retirement Cola bills and I just
 
05:35:26.448 --> 05:35:26.458 align:start position:0%
said I don't believe so next week uh so
 
05:35:29.090 --> 05:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
I just want to state that I fine with us
 
05:35:31.128 --> 05:35:31.138 align:start position:0%
discussing it I I wouldn't want to take
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
a vote on this either way just because
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
out of honor to telling them that oh
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
we're not taking it up there today and
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
then exactly right so uh I just want to
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
say that in the record I apologize to
 
05:35:45.890 --> 05:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
the whoever I talk to that oh we're you
 
05:35:48.288 --> 05:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
can go home but um we don't have a lot
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
of bills like this right right
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the record
 
05:35:57.010 --> 05:35:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:01.010 --> 05:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
just just to put an ore in the water uh
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
it might be a good idea in the process
 
05:36:04.730 --> 05:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
of since we're not going to do anything
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
until next week let's take a look at the
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
language of the bill because when you're
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
talking about colas there were some some
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
unions have contracts with the employer
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
us being an employer nowhere by any any
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh increases that I voted I don't do not
 
05:36:25.610 --> 05:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
have to you don't have to say in the
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill that it's a permanent thing all you
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
have to do is say you're increasing the
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
salaries of such and such people by so
 
05:36:33.650 --> 05:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
many percent as is normally the case
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
with that and that just that just
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
automatically sets off a chain of events
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
and if that's not what you want to do I
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
think you ought to have somebody take a
 
05:36:46.490 --> 05:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
look at the bull Bill and make sure that
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not just saying something
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
but it's going to take you 40 years in
 
05:36:52.610 --> 05:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
the future
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's what representative
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire was suggesting just like not
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
going into the future but like at one
 
05:37:03.350 --> 05:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
time period we had I think was a 30
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
000 threshold or something yeah last
 
05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
time yeah when we provided people that
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
weren't yeah so those people that were
 
05:37:14.570 --> 05:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
in the lower end if they just got a coal
 
05:37:16.550 --> 05:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
and those people that hire in go to less
 
05:37:19.010 --> 05:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
about yeah and it might have advised I
 
05:37:20.448 --> 05:37:20.458 align:start position:0%
don't know if it applied to group ones
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
also last time yes yes
 
05:37:26.810 --> 05:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
for that yeah
 
05:37:29.448 --> 05:37:29.458 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman do we know what the
 
05:37:31.390 --> 05:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
total hit was uh
 
05:37:37.090 --> 05:37:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
we can lift that up
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll have that from Monday and give
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
us a good idea and maybe I think
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
representative wire's suggestion is a
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
good one representative Campbell yeah I
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
I like representative McGuire's idea
 
05:37:52.330 --> 05:37:52.340 align:start position:0%
because I think I think it's reasonable
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
given the current circumstances in the
 
05:37:57.770 --> 05:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
economy that they get a some sort of
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
adjustment but one time but as we all
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
know for our president
 
05:38:04.368 --> 05:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
um inflation is transitory and it's
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to go away in two years so so we
 
05:38:12.050 --> 05:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.730 --> 05:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah and
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
specifically this is a
 
05:38:18.650 --> 05:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
I don't have the numbers or I don't know
 
05:38:20.690 --> 05:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
if we've been told the number of people
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
in this group but it's pretty small
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
these are only police and fire who have
 
05:38:29.930 --> 05:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
been retired 10 years or more already
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
right so these are for people that are
 
05:38:35.208 --> 05:38:35.218 align:start position:0%
currently retired 10 years or more and
 
05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
it's broken into two groups those
 
05:38:40.550 --> 05:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
retired already 20 years or more and
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
those 10 to 20. so the 10 to 20s
 
05:38:48.410 --> 05:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
are getting a 10 a five percent I think
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's a five percent increase on the
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
first fifty thousand dollars of their
 
05:38:56.930 --> 05:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
retirement pay so it's not for the the
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand type people it's for
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
the you know first fifty thousand and
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
then the the ones retired 20 years or
 
05:39:05.948 --> 05:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
more are getting a ten percent increase
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
on their first fifty thousand so it's
 
05:39:08.520 --> 05:39:10.910 align:start position:0%
on their first fifty thousand so it's
either

05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
um let's say everybody was fifty
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
thousand it would be a twenty five
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar a year increase
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the 10 to 20 group and a five
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a year increase for the
 
05:39:26.208 --> 05:39:26.218 align:start position:0%
twenty plus group so it may not or less
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
right so yeah it may not be hard to
 
05:39:29.810 --> 05:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
resurrect us because I know we spent a
 
05:39:31.610 --> 05:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
lot of time in the last budget trying to
 
05:39:33.530 --> 05:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
work the numbers so if you did something
 
05:39:36.110 --> 05:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
almost identical we would know pretty
 
05:39:38.810 --> 05:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
quickly how much it would be and
 
05:39:41.570 --> 05:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
so Mike I guess Melissa looked for that
 
05:39:44.570 --> 05:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
bill or what we added to the budget last
 
05:39:46.730 --> 05:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
time is probably the language is already
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
there and seemed to work pretty well
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time payment
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
are there any further issues
 
05:39:58.850 --> 05:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
I guess not we'll see you
 
05:39:58.860 --> 05:40:15.410 align:start position:0%
I guess not we'll see you
Monday

05:40:15.410 --> 05:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.420 --> 05:40:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
please

05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.070 --> 05:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.490 --> 05:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.718 --> 05:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
huh

05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
huh
 
05:41:26.930 --> 05:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.288 --> 05:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.810 --> 05:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
and just so we'll all know this weekend
 
05:41:44.930 --> 05:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.200 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
um
